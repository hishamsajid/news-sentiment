The statement from the army brass, released after the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) held at General Headquarters (GHQ), comes in the wake of last week’s
provocative remarks
by top Indian civil-military leadership.
Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. He had said that Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion.
The Pakistan military had issued a strong response to the remarks and wanred that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and the country would “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”. It had said that “those seeking to establish a new normal must know that Pakistan has established a new normal of response , which will be swift, decisive and destructive”.
A statement from the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued today said that the military brass also took notice of the remarks in today’s CCC.
“The forum pledged to counter any Indian aggression with a swift and decisive response, shattering any perceived notion of India’s relative safety accruing from geography. Any imaginary new normal will be met with a new normal of swift retributive response,” the ISPR said.
It added that the military leadership expressed grave concerns about the recent “irresponsible and unwarranted provocative statements” by the Indian civil and military leadership.
“Such rhetoric conforms to the well-known Indian propensity of whipping up war hysteria for political benefits. The participants agreed that unwarranted warmongering is likely to lead to heightened tensions and will endanger regional peace and security,” the ISPR said.
The military’s media wing said the meeting commenced with prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks “orchestrated by Indian terror proxies”.
Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir “commended the spirit, resolve and determination of the Pakistan armed forces in war against foreign-sponsored terror proxies and during extensive relief and rescue operations in the aftermath of recent floods, in conjunction with civil administration and other law enforcement agencies”, the statement said.
It further added that the forum undertook a “comprehensive review’’ of ongoing counter-terrorism operations, emerging threat paradigms and operational readiness and reaffirmed that the military remained ready to “thwart inimical designs of Pakistan’s adversaries across all domains”.
The ISPR also said that the CCC members affirmed that the “existing nexus between terror and crime with vested political patronage, which is gravely hurting the interests of the state and security of its people, will not be allowed to continue anymore, come what may”.
The military’s media wing further said that the participants expressed their resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the
Fitna al-Khawarij
and
Fitna al-Hindustan
.
Fitna al-Khawarij
is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as
Fitna al-Hindu­stan
— a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
The participants also acknowledged the significance of Pakistan’s recent high-level diplomatic engagements and reaffirmed their commitment to global and regional peace. In particular, the military welcomed the landmark mutual defence deal between Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and said it underscored “shared values, mutual respect, and a joint vision” for peace and security in the Middle Eastern and South Asian regions.
Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark
mutual defence agreement
, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh in September.
“The forum reiterated Pakistan’s uncompromising support for the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people for their right to self-determination, as enshrined in relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The forum also reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and hoped for early ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. The forum reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance on Palestine issue, voicing support for the two-state solution with an independent Palestinian state, based on pre-1967 borders and Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
“In his closing remarks, the COAS, directed the commanders to ensure the highest standards of operational readiness, discipline, physical fitness, innovation and responsiveness. The COAS expressed full confidence in the operational preparedness of Pakistan Army to counter threats across the entire spectrum, from conventional and sub-conventional, to hybrid and asymmetric threats,” the military’s media wing concluded.",2025-10-08,Dawn.com,1363,0.000162
https://www.dawn.com/news/1948886,SMOG IS THE FIFTH SEASON - DAWN.COM,"IT is not rare anymore for Lahore to be the most polluted city in the world, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) crossing all known hazard zones. Just days ago, it was 180 when it should have been less than 100 to be acceptable.
Alarmingly, it was September, which is not even considered part of the dreaded smog season when AQI values soar past the 1,000 mark; twice of the upper cap of the AQI hazardous range.
In the IQAir country ranking for 2024, Pakistan was third on the list of countries having the worst air quality, following only Chad and Bangladesh. In 2024, AQI in several cities of Punjab crossed the hazardous level.
Other than Lahore, these cities were Multan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot and Rawalpindi/Islamabad. In November last year, the AQI crossed 1,000 for the first time since the monitoring of smog started in Lahore. In the same month it touched 1,173.
According to the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative (PAQI), the pollution of PM2.5 — fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health — pollution increased by 25pc in Lahore in 2024 compared to 2023. The average pollution level also went up by 23pc compared to last year. These are serious numbers demanding serious actions.
Activist Dr Ajaz Anwar, spearheading the Lahore Conservation Society, says there was a time when most people would walk in the city and ride bicycles. “One cannot even think of these activities in contemporary Lahore because the city has been expanded in such a way that there is no space left for either pedestrians or cyclists.” Lack of public transport, he says, has led to an influx of motorcycles and rickshaws that emit smoke and pollute the air.
LIFE EXPECTANCY IN PUNJAB HAS GONE DOWN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT NEXT?
Zainab Naeem, an environmental scientist working with the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), also believes that other than the natural phenomena involved, human activities — vehicular emissions, stubble burning, brick kilns and industrial emissions — are behind the spike in air pollution.
Worryingly, the expert expects to have a more severe spell of smog this winter due to heavy floods across Punjab in both Pakistan and India. “There were long spells of rains and heavy flooding in the riverine areas of Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab across the border. The floods brought silt and mud with them and left it behind on the planes when the floodwater receded. The moisture in the air holds dust particles rising from the silt left behind by floodwater for a longer time and this can cause more pollution, hence more smog,” she warns.
However, environmental lawyer Ahmed Rafay Alam sees a silver lining, saying that many areas in the rice belt of Pakistan had the crop washed away completely by the floods, which means there would be less crop residue burning this season.
The eastern wind that takes smog and air pollution away from Pakistan may come in October this year instead of November when it normally starts blowing. “The early wind and less crop burning may lead to less intense smog, and, if it happens, the change would occur only owing to the natural phenomenon,” he stresses.
Talking about the administrative issues involved, Rafay points out that after the 18th Amendment, the environment became a provincial subject, and the provinces made their own laws. The problem, he points out, is that they just copied the earlier federal law without doing any extensive work on it. Punjab was no different. While hearing a public interest petition in 2016, the then chief justice of the Lahore High Court asked the provincial government to make a policy on environment which the relevant department subsequently presented in the high court. A Smog Commission was formed on the order of the court, which prepared a policy document to mitigate and control smog and air quality in 2017, recalls Rafay, regretting that a political change in 2018 changed everything. He suggests the formation of new laws as the current ones were drafted 30 years ago.
The government, says Zainab, should take steps to increase buffer zones to improve air quality, and focus on building a circular economy that may utilise crop residue as raw material for other products. “Industrial emissions should be controlled, and air pollution data should be collected to make effective strategies to fight air pollution.
Data should be collected from the Indian Punjab as well, using satellite technology in case the Indian government does not share it voluntarily. Cycling should be promoted, and the entry of heavy vehicles in cities should be banned except for certain days of the week,” she adds. Dr Ajaz also suggests increasing the green cover in the cities, but regrets that even though trees produce oxygen, “it is tragic that trees are being taken down in the name of development”.
While all these suggestions sound good, Rafay throws a spanner in the works by pointing out that even if Punjab starts taking all the required action to control air pollution today, it would take at least eight to 10 years to make a significant change, or bring the air back to bearable level. “And it will require massive investments at each stage.” Life expectancy in Lahore has already been reduced by eight years.
Punjab needs urgent action without hoping for an early result. This is quite a conundrum.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1948887,Time for Reorientation - DAWN.COM,"AIR pollution in Pakistan represents a multifaceted environmental and public policy challenge, stemming from a variety of sources that collectively degrade air quality and public health across the nation.
Key contributors include vehicular emissions from an expanding fleet of ill-maintained vehicles, industrial discharges from sectors like textiles and cement, dust from construction activities and unpaved roads, emissions from brick kilns that rely on low-quality fuel, and seasonal practices such as stubble burning. These factors interact with meteorological conditions, such as temperature inversions in winter, to trap the pollutants and create dense smog layers.
Among these, stubble burning emerges as a particularly hazardous issue during the autumn months, when farmers in Punjab incinerate crop residue post-harvest, releasing vast quantities of particulate matter and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that exacerbate the already bad pollution levels.
Stubble burning is deeply intertwined with the agrarian evolution of South Asia, particularly the rice-wheat cropping system that dominates Punjab.
Time is surely up for stubble burning as a routing agricultural practice in Pakistan. However, top-down solutions are bound to fail just as they have failed every single time we have tried.
This intensive rotation with rice sown in the monsoon (June-October), followed immediately by wheat in the dry winter (November-April) has its genesis in the Green Revolution of the 1960s. High-yielding varieties promised food security, but they came with a hidden cost: shorter crop durations and mechanised harvesting that left behind tall, dense stubble residue difficult to manage manually. In Pakistan, where Punjab’s 80 per cent mechanised rice harvest mirrors India’s, farmers face a mere 15-20-day window to clear the fields for wheat sowing, lest yields plummet owing to delayed planting. Similarly, in India’s northwestern states, the same Green Revolution dynamics have led to widespread mechanisation, amplifying the regional pollution footprint.
To the farmers, burning offers a swift solution.
It sterilises soil against pests, releases short-term nutrients like phosphorus and potassium, and costwise it is far cheaper than other methods that add up to 30pc to labour expenses. A 2019 emission inventory spanning 2000-14 reveals how this practice scaled with agricultural intensification: annual rice residue production hit 8.5 million tonnes, with 3.6-5 million tonnes burned between October and January to expedite wheat planting. In India, parallel trends show even larger scales, with over 23 million tonnes of rice stubble burned annually in Punjab and Haryana alone, contributing significantly to transboundary emissions that drift into Pakistan’s airspace during prevailing westerly winds in autumn.
Colonial-era land policies favoured monocropping, and post-independence subsidies for water and fertilisers further cemented this trend. In south Punjab villages, a 2019 study found that 85pc of the respondents viewed burning as a cultural norm, inherited from generations who saw it as essential for survival amid labour shortages and rising input costs. Yet, as climate variability shortens monsoons and intensifies winters, what was once adaptive has become maladaptive. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) attributes 20pc of Pakistan’s air pollutants to this source, a figure that underscores how historical expediency feeds an ongoing crisis. Comparable figures in India attribute up to 30pc of Delhi’s winter PM2.5 to stubble fires from neighbouring states, highlighting the shared historical roots and cross-border ramifications of this practice.
The smoke from stubble fires does not dissipate; it infiltrates lungs, soils and skies, weaving a web of health hazards. An
analysis estimates
that incinerating 63 million tonnes of South Asian stubble annually results in 1.2 million tonnes of particulate matter, 0.6 million tonnes of methane, and 91 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2)-equivalents that spike PM2.5 levels by 40-60pc during harvest peaks. In Pakistan, this manifests as winter smog, where thermal inversions trap pollutants, turning Air Quality Index (AQI) in urban centres, such as
Lahore
and Multan, to hazardous levels and beyond. Across the border,
Delhi experiences analogous spikes
during the same period, as satellite data reveals plumes from Indian Punjab merging with those from Pakistani Punjab to form a regional haze.
The cost to human health is staggering. The Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) reports that crop burning shaves 4.3 years off average life expectancy in polluted hotspots, with over 20,000 premature adult deaths and 160,000 disability adjusted life years lost annually in Pakistan alone. Infants and children bear the brunt, as is evident from a study that appeared in the journal Nature. It highlights how across India and Pakistan in-utero PM2.5 exposure from stubble burning results in 24-26 additional infant deaths and 30-36 child deaths per 1,000 births. Respiratory ailments surge, while cardiovascular and neurological diseases affect thousands more. In Lahore, where 14 million residents inhale this hazardous air, hospital admissions for pollution related illnesses triple during the smog season, costing the exchequer significant sums in lost productivity. In Delhi, similar surges overwhelm healthcare systems, with studies estimating 10,000-30,000 annual deaths attributable to stubble-related pollution.
Environmentally, the fallout erodes the very foundation of our breadbasket. Burning volatilises nitrogen (75pc loss), phosphorus and sulphur, slashing soil fertility by 25-30pc and microbial diversity, which hampers water retention and increases erosion. Black carbon, the second-largest warming agent after CO2, accelerates glacial melt in the Himalayas, threatening downstream water and food security for 1.9 billion South Asians. Economically, air pollution devours 6.5pc of GDP, up to $12 billion yearly, through diseases, absenteeism and dips in crop yield owing to acid rain and ozone formation.
A
bureaucrat incentive experiment
, discussed in the aforementioned Nature study, serves as a caution against relying solely on command-and-control mechanisms to address the issue. Analysing 18 million grid observations (2012-22) across India and Pakistan, it found that when winds blow smoke into a particular district, officials slash fires by 10-13pc via targeted penalties. In Lahore, a similar order reduced fires by 9pc in monitored blocks, as per satellite data. Yet, spillover effects persist. The study reveals that the incidence of stubble burning rose by 15pc when winds favoured neighbours, highlighting enforcement’s jurisdictional blind spots. This transboundary dynamic is reflected in India-Pakistan interactions as well, where Indian fires increase when winds direct smoke towards Pakistan.
To effectively address the persistent challenge of stubble burning in South Asia, policymakers should prioritise a holistic environmental policy framework. Such an approach will integrate key facets of environmental communication, emphasising stakeholder engagement over reliance on traditional command-and-control measures, like bans and fines, which have not been sustainable. A communication centred approach could foster voluntary adoption by reframing the issue from a mere regulatory burden to a shared health and economic imperative. Use of vivid, localised narratives in campaigns that depict the direct impacts of smog on family health can go a long way in facilitating this. This framing could build empathy and urgency, drawing on psychological tools like future-self visualisation exercises where farmers imagine the degraded land inheritance for their children, ultimately yielding higher compliance rates than punitive measures alone. A compelling global parallel is Indonesia’s Pertamina Corporate Social Responsibility programme for peatland fires, where corporate communication reframed fire-prone practices as community threats through targeted narratives on health and economic losses.
Building on this, policy recommendations should include audience segmentation and targeting to tailor messages for diverse groups, ensuring relevance and overcoming the ‘one-size-fits-all’ pitfalls of command and-control strategies. A more holistic policy would segment communications, delivering Punjabi language podcasts on bio-decomposers to frontline farmers, workshops for community unions, and datadriven briefs for policymakers. Besides, participatory dialogue and co-design should be embedded in policy to co-create solutions with stakeholders, contrasting sharply with the top-down enforcement of measures.
Transboundary policy options are essential given the cross-border flow of pollution. Establishing a joint Pakistan-India task force under frameworks like the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) could harmonise air quality standards, share real-time satellite monitoring data on fire incidents, and co-develop incentives for alternatives to burning, such as cross-border subsidies for specific machinery.
Bilateral agreements could include mutual enforcement protocols through ‘smog diplomacy’ initiatives. Such regional approaches, supported by international bodies, would amplify national efforts and mitigate the blame-game that hinders progress.
Southeast Asia’s haze mitigation efforts offer direct lessons here. In particular, the Asean Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (2002, revised 2014), has curbed recurrent peatland fires in Indonesia and Malaysia via regional monitoring networks, early warning systems and joint suppression teams. The result has been reduced haze episodes by up to 70pc in compliant years, and fostering trust through annual ministerial meetings and public awareness drives that depoliticise the issue.
Finally, robust evaluation and feedback loops should underpin these policies to ensure iterative improvement.
By integrating satellite verification in farmer apps, annual reports on health benefits, like reduced child mortality, and goal-setting for zero-burn villages, policies can effectively refine long-term strategies. Addressing complex environmental and public policy issues, such as air pollution, through command and control or siloed approaches has not worked. Hence, what is required is a sea change in our thinking that places collaboration before conflict and collective human wellbeing before shortsighted political goals.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949486/how-to-fix-blurry-images-and-enhance-photos-with-ai,How to fix blurry images and enhance photos with AI - Sponsored - DAWN.COM,"Have you ever faced the problem of having blurry and grainy photos? It’s quite frustrating when those important images turn out out of focus or with such low resolution that you can’t post or print them clearly. Fortunately, today this problem has a simple solution. You don’t need professional knowledge or expensive programmes. With an AI
image quality enhancer
like Artguru, anyone can make their photos look sharper and more detailed. In this guide, you’ll discover exactly how to do it.
Why do photos turn out blurry and with low definition?
The low quality of a photo is a general term that can hide different problems. The good news is that modern neural networks can solve most of them. It’s very likely that you recognise your situation in one of the following points:
1. The photo is too small.
This is the main reason. Images downloaded from the internet, messaging services (like WhatsApp) or social media are usually very compressed and lose size. When you try to enlarge them, they instantly become blurry.
2. Slight camera shake.
Even if you try to hold the camera steady, a minimal vibration of your hands when you press the button can cause a slight blur. As a result, the overall sharpness of the image decreases, even if it’s not always obvious to the naked eye.
3. Movement in the scene.
If you were photographing a person, an animal or a moving car, they might appear slightly out of focus against a sharp background.
4. Focusing error.
Sometimes, the camera’s autofocus focuses on the background instead of the main subject. That’s why a person’s face may look less sharp than the trees behind them.
5. Low-light photography.
At dusk or in a dark room, photos often show digital noise, a fine grain that “eats up” the details.
6. Scanned old photos.
Over time, paper photographs lose colour, get scratched and lose sharpness. When you scan them, all these defects are transferred to the digital file.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949540/why-are-multinationals-exiting-pakistan,WHY ARE MULTINATIONALS EXITING PAKISTAN? - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"There have been a flurry of announcements over the last few years by various multinational corporations (MNCs), either exiting Pakistan or significantly scaling down their operations here.  Some of the prominent ones include
Procter & Gamble
, Shell, Caltex and Eli Lily, among others.
There has also been a significant slowdown in manufacturing activity, where more than half of products tracked by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics through the Large Scale Manufacturing index have exhibited a median drop in production of 10 percent annually, over the last two years.
The gradual exodus of MNCs from Pakistan is a multifaceted affair that cannot be viewed through a mundane political lens. It is a mix of evolving strategies at a global or regional level for the respective entity, as well as a lacklustre economic and investment environment locally.
This write-up explores how the business models of MNCs have evolved over the years and how a shift in global trade is catalysing the exodus. There is also some introspection about how consistently elevated sovereign risk, and one of the more regressive taxation regimes in the world, has pushed any kind of formal business over the edge in Pakistan.
Even as the government touts policies to attract foreign investment, a number of multinational giants have been scaling back or exiting from Pakistan in recent times. What is going on here?
Is this the global economic environment at play or does this reflect deep fractures in the
country’s economic and regulatory framework? And can anything be done about it?
HISTORIC CONTEXT
Many MNCs that exist in developing markets were birthed by parent entities operating in those areas, mostly to serve the interests of colonial powers, or to consolidate the same.
As  the sun started to set on colonialism after World War II, the emperor got new clothes, the MNC in this case, and they all got a makeover, trying to shy away from a troubled history. It can be an MNC that sold soaps and was notorious for operating palm plantations through bonded labour in Central Africa, or an MNC that basically led the Nazi war machine but now sells innocuous chemicals.
The history of MNCs has been dramatic and they have evolved with time. Only recently, after 355 years in operations, did the Hudson’s Bay Company shut down, after laying the foundations of Canada through trading fur across the Atlantic and eventually morphing into its largest landowner — only to be succeeded by a chain of department stores that were killed by e-commerce. They could survive multiple wars and the death of the Empire, but could not survive the post-pandemic transition to e-commerce shopping.
During the late 2000s, there was a similar mass exodus of financial institutions, not just from Pakistan but from other developing markets as well. This was largely due to higher compliance costs and the realisation that the only way to give economic returns to shareholders was to scale up and become one of the top five institutions in the respective country. It is only through scale that one can extract economic returns; without scale, they struggle and keep losing market share.
Many of these institutions survived the Opium Wars in China, and others, only to be forced to scale down by activist shareholders. Currently, only one bank from the times of the Empire continues to exist as a shell of its former self, while the rest have exited not just Pakistan but other emerging markets as well.
THE CHINESE CENTURY
The current wave of MNC exits can be partially attributed to the emergence of China as the world’s factory. This led to production of goods at a scale never seen before, and with scale comes lower cost. In emerging markets with relatively low household incomes, cost competitiveness remains critical and China provided the same.
Most MNCs operating in Pakistan, or those that have left, were largely involved in production of low value-added or primary products. Making diapers, washing detergent, or a basic generic drug does not require sophisticated knowledge or skill that cannot be replicated elsewhere. As China continued to compete on cost, local production became increasingly uncompetitive.
This led to the emergence of local brands that competed on price and made the overall competitive environment more intense. MNCs, instead of doubling down and attempting to scale, figured it might be easier to shut down operations and revert to a distribution model. Why bother manufacturing when you can import and trade the same? This is where the industrial policy of the country completely failed.
In many cases of consumer goods, some MNCs even produced advertisements at scale in Southeast Asia, assuming that all people of the Subcontinent look the same, subtly mocking actual paying consumers in the process. One can mock consumers only for so long and, in the case of primary products, consumers are often very price sensitive — a strong brand can compensate only to a certain extent for a price-conscious customer. As local brands started to prop up, the operating space for MNCs became further constrained, eventually leading to a point where the consumer gravitated towards local brands.
‘GREED IS GOOD’
The fictional character, Gordon Gekko, uttered the famous words “Greed is good” in the film Wall Street, while exemplifying the role of free markets in arriving at an optimal solution that benefits everyone and shareholders the most. In matters of capital allocation, shareholders lately are not swayed by emotional concepts such as patriotism or nationalism.
More recently, German engineering and chemical behemoths started moving out of Germany to the US and other jurisdictions where energy costs were lower — not because they were any less German, but because they were losing the competitive advantage provided by cheap Russian gas, which stopped following the initiation of the Russia-Ukraine war.
Similarly, a large number of financial institutions and energy companies moved their headquarters from the UK to other jurisdictions post-Brexit. A shareholder is more interested in how their economic returns can be maximised and makes decisions accordingly. Any other considerations may be noble but are noise at best. If a jurisdiction cannot provide the requisite economic returns, the MNC (or any rational business) will eventually shut down that business.
In the absence of perpetual state subsidies, or protection as a perpetual infant, which are hallmarks of economic policies in Pakistan, no business can survive without being competitive in the local environment.
INVEST IN PAKISTAN? WHY?
Now let’s turn our attention specifically to Pakistan’s economic environment.
An economy’s gross domestic product (GDP) is a function of private consumption, government consumption, investments and net trade (more exports and fewer imports). The cumulative sum of all these factors leads to the calculation of GDP. Over the last 10 years, Pakistan has evolved into a consumption-oriented economy, wherein 99 percent of our GDP is essentially consumption.
To provide more context, for a typical lower middle-income economy, consumption makes up 81 percent of GDP, while the average for South Asia is 72 percent of GDP. This effectively means that we do not invest, produce, or export a lot — we just import and consume.
As we import more, we need more foreign currency, because that is how one buys imports, and when there isn’t much foreign currency available, this leads to the Pakistani rupee (PKR) losing its value, triggering a spurt of inflation before it settles, only for this Groundhog Day situation to repeat again.  If saner heads do not prevail, we may see the same happening again within the next 18 months.
Before we can produce anything, we need to invest in productive capacity first. The Investment-to-GDP ratio for Pakistan has consistently remained in the range of 12 percent, while that for South Asia is 32 percent, and for lower middle-income countries, it is 30 percent. If Pakistan ever wants to be a middle-income country, it needs to achieve and maintain an Investment-to-GDP ratio in the range of 25-30 percent consistently.
It is only through investment in productive capacity that we can produce more, create more jobs and generate an economic spillover effect that leads to improved household incomes. No country has ever become a middle-income economy, or better, without investing in itself. There is literally no other way — it is simply not possible to become prosperous just through consumption.
Investment in an economy is mostly a domestic affair, but we have it completely flipped. The government and its coterie of sycophants continue to beat the drums of foreign direct investment (FDI) without any introspection. For lower middle-income economies, FDI makes up around four percent of total investment, while for selected middle-income countries’ economies, it hovers in the range of five to 12 percent of total investment.
Only in the case of Vietnam is FDI maintained in the range of 12 percent. Effectively, domestic investment makes up more than 90 percent of investment across the board, a fact we completely ignore in the rush to sign off another Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which is as good as exchanging business cards at a conference.
There is absolutely no reason why foreign capital would gravitate towards an economy where domestic investors are also reluctant to invest. Even when they do invest, they invest in non-productive segments, such as real-estate, largely due to an atrociously regressive taxation policy that penalises formal investment, production and value-added initiatives.
Digging deeper, investment is largely a function of savings, and given the state of financial exclusion and an inefficient taxation regime, there is little to no incentive to save through formal financial channels, resulting in a scenario where most savings find their way to inefficient avenues, such as real estate, stashing cash under the mattress, or gold.
None of these generate any worthwhile economic activity that can boost production. The investment problem cannot be solved without addressing the savings problem first. Policymakers currently continue to focus only on foreign direct investment, which does not solve any problem.
In a dysfunctional investment environment, the case to continue and expand operations in Pakistan remains weak. And it is further weakened through heightened sovereign risk, whether due to border skirmishes or the musical chairs that accompany leadership changes, eventually resulting in policy inconsistency.
THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS
The cost of doing business formally in Pakistan is much higher than the cost of doing business informally.
For example, an entity operating in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) space formally has to comply with all taxation and other financial or legal constraints. This can include a direct tax that can go as high as 40 percent, a contribution to the Workers’ Welfare Fund or Workers’ Profit Participation Fund that can exceed seven percent of Profit Before Tax, and a dividend tax of 15 percent. The effective tax an entity in the formal sphere pays exceeds 50 percent of its Profit Before Tax, even though the company is taking market risk.
Such an effective tax rate is much higher than in many developed economies. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) effective tax rate is 25.4 percent, while the highest is 34.8 percent in Columbia. In such a scenario, there is little reason for any entity to operate formally in an environment where half of its profitability is simply gobbled up by the State.
Similarly, any such company operating formally also has to comply with all Sales Tax requirements which, at 17 percent, are among the highest in the world, effectively discouraging more goods from coming into the taxation net. Meanwhile, any entity operating informally and selling smuggled goods can completely avoid paying this Sales Tax, effectively cannibalising the sales of the entity operating in the formal sphere.
Such a structure is so lopsided that an MNC operating formally and selling goods while paying all taxes may be cannibalised by the same goods it is selling, but which are either smuggled or imported at a lower tax rate, wherein the distributor and retailer can avoid paying Sales Tax through one way or another. Effectively, FMCG companies get cannibalised by their own products, due to an inefficient and perverse taxation regime.

DETERIORATING REAL INCOMES
Pakistan has been plagued by economic stagnation for the last seven years, if not more. Whenever an MNC enters a country, the expectation is that overall prosperity levels will gradually increase and so will household incomes. Due to economic stagnation, however, per capita income levels have actually gone down in American dollar terms. Moreover, adjusting for the tax burden, real income after tax has gone down even more.
Over a seven-year period, real income has effectively gone down by 45-50 percent and, after adjusting the same for taxes, it has gone down by more than 50 percent, with households across the spectrum (with the rare exception of those right at the top) losing half their disposable income.
It is estimated that expenditure on food made up 47 percent of the poorest 20 percent of households’ budget in 2017-18.  Expenditure on food now makes up about 65 percent of the poorest 20 percent of households’ budget in 2024-25. This effectively means that more expenditure is being reallocated to meet basic existential needs, squeezing away demand from other areas, such as health and education.  Effectively, there is less disposable income to go around, which means a lower demand for products.
For a market such as Pakistan, an MNC typically introduces the lowest-margin and most basic quality of products. As real income levels go down, so does demand for such products. The demand drops so much that entities have to resort to ‘shrinkflation’ — reducing the size of a product while not increasing prices. Shrinkflation implies moving down the value chain rather than going up — and that is a death knell for any growth-oriented entity.
The earlier notion that economic growth may lead to prosperity and higher income levels, eventually leading to demand for higher-margin and slightly more premium products, falls flat. Due to such a scenario, MNCs can see their revenue and profitability decline in American dollar terms while, at a shareholder level, this is seen as ineffective allocation of capital that can be reallocated elsewhere or returned to shareholders as dividends.

A THRIVING GREY MARKET
MNCs have to operate within a framework of compliance, even though their history may be dotted with all sorts of ethical discrepancies. As an example, in the case of petroleum products, there was a massive surge in the flow of gasoline and diesel from Pakistan’s western border through informal channels. The impact of such a flow led to a sharp reduction in the official sale of gasoline and diesel in 2022-23.
Officially, gasoline sales dropped by 20.6 percent, while diesel sales dropped by 37.1 percent in Sindh. We are specifically focusing on Sindh here because it provides granular details and is more transparent with public dissemination of data. The sale of petroleum products is a fairly stable metric — a significant drop implies substitution of the same with another product, or a product that is not captured by the formal economy.
As sales of smuggled petroleum products increased, it became increasingly difficult for MNCs to compete. Many petrol stations could simply blend formal and smuggled products, pretending nothing was happening, and capture the delta that emerged from taxes, which had to be paid on formal goods but not on smuggled products.
As such activity took hold, MNCs started losing market share, while reputational risk became ever more apparent, potentially leading to heavier penalties elsewhere. Inadvertently, in such a scenario, an exit from a market is better than losing market share and risking penalties in the process.
Similarly, Pakistan could never see the emergence of any serious MNC in the wholesale and retail space, largely because of the inability of MNCs to maintain multiple books of accounts to manage smuggling or goods trading in the informal economy. Local players can manage a profitable suite of formal and smuggled products, while MNCs would not be able to compete with such a product mix. In such an environment, where one is simply not able to compete because of a lopsided taxation environment, the market holds little promise for any serious growth.
A pertinent metric of the prevalence of an informal economy is the ratio of Private Sector Business Deposits to Government Deposits, because a government will always have to use banking channels for its transactions, but private sector businesses can avoid formal channels. The ratio clearly demonstrates a significant drop, as the deposit growth of private sector businesses continued to lag behind government deposits, with most businesses preferring to operate in the grey, or as individuals to avoid taxation.

PRICE FIXING
The government has an obsession with fixing prices, a practice that has historically never worked, with thousands of years of economic history clearly demonstrating that the wisdom of policymakers cannot catch up to the invisible hand of the market. The government, and its different tentacles, has a habit of fixing prices, whether for medicine, electricity, gas, or something as mundane as milk or jalebis.
An economic environment where prices can be arbitrarily fixed leads to inefficient allocation of resources and does not allow businesses to compete in a fair environment. Fixing prices when costs increase results in losses for the producer, who then has to decide whether to continue with the business or completely change strategy.
The drop-off-a-cliff of the pharmaceutical industry, and its eventual plateauing, clearly demonstrates the same. Pharmaceutical production over the last three years has flat-lined and is much lower than in the years before that, even though the population continues to grow.
It can be seen in the production of tablets, syrups, capsules, injections and every other product. The demand continues to be there, but production has dropped as manufacturers moved towards a trading-oriented model. This is a classic case of shooting oneself in the foot: we destroy productive capacity through arbitrary pricing mechanisms and delayed drug approvals — and then we wonder why every pharmaceutical entity is packing up shop.

THE TAX ARBITRAGE
To keep it simple: if operating formally, an entity has to navigate the labyrinth of the tax code and incur additional compliance costs in managing it, while also having to increase the price of its final product. Meanwhile, if that product is competing with a product that can be smuggled or produced while evading taxes, the formally and honestly operating entity becomes uncompetitive, as its product is priced higher than others, resulting in erosion of market share.

An entity operating formally and complying with all regulatory requirements is actually priced out of the market. In such a scenario, there is no room for any sustainable growth, and companies eventually have to decide whether to operate formally and continue bleeding, or move towards the dark side.
HOW DO WE FIX THIS?
There is no magic bullet or magic pill. The road to reform is rocky and does not require an incessant number of conferences that do not solve any problem. It requires the will to solve the underlying economic problem, and that is a distortionary taxation and chaotic investment regime. The taxation structure needs to be fixed such that domestic investment is incentivised and risk-taking is rewarded rather than penalised.
This requires a significant reduction in corporate taxes and all other incidentals, whether that is super tax or other charges. It also requires a transition from the informal economy to the formal economy, and that can only happen with a massive reduction in currency in circulation and lower tax rates across the board. It is economically inefficient to operate formally in this economy; this is what needs to change.
The groupie behaviour to court foreign investors also needs to evolve. Solve problems for domestic investors first and foreign capital will follow. Capital follows risk-adjusted returns — it will gravitate towards whatever jurisdiction can provide more sustainable returns. The government should not be doing micro-interventions. It should be creating an enabling environment for competition to emerge and for attracting efficiency-seeking foreign direct investment. If we are being pushed to provide guaranteed returns for foreign capital, the battle is already lost at that point.
The government needs to step back from its obsessive-compulsive urge to set an arbitrary price for everything and creating unintended consequences in the process. Create an enabling environment and let the market operate. Creating an enabling environment is a long-drawn, boring process that cannot yield quick wins that can be celebrated with a half-page newspaper ad. This is where institutional development needs to happen, such that the enabling environment can sustain itself.
Savings need to be mobilised through formal financial infrastructure and reallocation of the same into non-productive areas needs to be penalised. It is easier to buy smuggled gold in Pakistan than to open a bank account or be part of the formal financial infrastructure — this is what needs to change.
None of the problems can be solved without solving for mobilisation of savings and redirecting the same towards productive enterprise. This is an economic problem and it needs to be addressed through economic tools rather than brute force, which never works on a long enough timeline.
The exodus of MNCs from Pakistan cannot be attributed to one specific issue but to a spectrum of issues that need to be addressed individually and as part of an economic reforms agenda. The first step in this journey is to accept that the wisdom of markets is far superior to the wisdom of policymakers. The sooner we accept this, the sooner we can start the reform journey.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949648/pakistan-sells-first-women-bank-to-uae-firm,Pakistan sells First Women Bank to UAE firm - Business - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday hailed the acquisition of First Women Bank Ltd (FWBL) by Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Company (IHC) as a milestone in Pakistan-UAE economic ties, saying the deal would pave the way for more joint ventures and partnerships across diverse sectors.
Speaking at a signing ceremony, the prime minister described the transaction as “the first drop of rain” in a broader effort to deepen economic collaboration with the United Arab Emirates.
The event marked the official transfer of a majority stake in FWBL to IHC under a government-to-government (G2G) framework. The UAE delegation was led by Sheikh Zayed bin Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, chairman of 2PointZero.
The federal cabinet had earlier approved the divestment of the government’s entire stake in FWBL, reportedly valued at $14.6 million (approximately Rs4.1 billion), a figure yet to be formally disclosed.
Buyer to inject Rs6.8bn more to meet capital requirements
In addition to acquiring the bank, IHC will meet the total minimum capital requirement of Rs10bn over five years. As of December 2024, FWBL’s equity stood at Rs3.2bn, with the new investor set to inject Rs6.8bn to bridge the gap.
Privatisation momentum
PM Shehbaz attributed the successful closure of the deal to the “determined and focused” leadership of Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Adviser on Privatisation Muhammad Ali. He reaffirmed his government’s commitment to restructuring state-owned enterprises and enabling private sector-led economic growth.
He added that FWBL’s founding mission — to support women entrepreneurs — would not only be preserved but also strengthened through professional management and targeted investments in sectors such as agriculture and industry.
IHC sees long-term growth
IHC Chief Executive Syed Basar Shueb said the investment signals confidence in Pakistan’s financial sector and reflects a shared vision for long-term development.
“We see strong potential in the country’s financial sector and look forward to supporting the bank’s modernisation journey by leveraging technology, automating banking processes, and advancing the use of AI in financial decision-making,” he said.
According to an official statement, this marks the first bank privatisation conducted under the
Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Act
2022. FWBL, established in 1989, currently operates 42 branches across Pakistan, serving retail, SME, and corporate clients.

• Khawaja Asif accuses Afghan Taliban of ‘sitting in India’s lap’; says terrorists will be made to pay heavy price, wherever they are
• Questions remain over Qatar-mediated talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in absence of clarity over who will attend
ISLAMABAD: With representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, a telling statement from the country’s defence minister indicated that the gloves were off, as Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack,
targeting
a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended their two-day
ceasefire
.
Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province, as security sources claimed that precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, reportedly killing dozens of fighters.
“If someone attacks Afgha­nistan, our forces are ready to respond,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Ariana News. However, Pakistani security sources pointed out that the ceasefire agreement bet­ween the Afghan government and Pakistan did not preclude stri­kes on terror outfits and their hideouts.
There was no statement from Pakistan’s military, but terrorists linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group had claimed responsibility for the attack on Khaddi Fort in Mir Ali, where a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the main gate of a military camp before attempting to stage an incursion earlier in the day.
Although there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on losses suffered, security sources claimed to have foiled the attack by eliminating all attackers.
The attack began on Friday morning, with local sources describing a massive explosion, followed by heavy gunfire as terrorists attempted to enter the military camp. Sources said that “all four” attackers were killed.
Heavy price to pay
In a telling statement posted to X (formerly Twitter), Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the relationship with Kabul would no longer be like it was in the past. “There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,” he wrote.
Mr Asif accused Afghanistan of “sitting in India’s lap and plotting conspiracies against Pakis­tan”, saying that Islamabad “can no longer afford to have relations with Kabul like in the past”.
“All Afghans on Pakistani soil will have to go back to their homeland,” he wrote. “Now they have their own government [or] caliphate in Kabul. It has been five years since the Islamic revolution… they must live with Pakistan as neighbours.”
In the post, the defence minister elaborated on the visits by Pakistani delegations to Kabul and provided figures for acts of terrorism by groups operating out of Afghanistan and the total number of casualties.
Since the Taliban took power in 2021, Pakistani foreign ministers visited Kabul four times; defence ministers and the ISI chiefs visited twice; the special representative and foreign secretaries carried out five visits each; the national security adviser visited once, and the Joint Coordination Committee had eight meetings in the Afghan capital.
He added that there were 225 border flag meetings, 836 protest notes and 13 demarches.
“From 2021 to date: 3,844 mar­tyred (civilians, military, and law enforcement agencies combined). Terrorist incidents: 10,347,” the defence minister listed.
Truce talks?
The fresh exchanges on Fri­day night cast a shadow over the ceasefire, which had been exte­nded just a few hours earlier, as well as the planned Doha talks.
“The ceasefire has been mutually extended by both Pakistan and Afghanistan till the end of the talks in Doha, Qatar. The talks are ready to begin [on Saturday],” a security source said on Friday evening at the conclusion of the initial 48-hour truce, which had been in effect since Wednesday.
The two-day ceasefire was largely observed without violations, but the dialogue initially agreed at the time of its announ­cement, aimed at addressing what Pakistan’s Foreign Office described as a “complex but solvable iss­ue”, failed to take place during that period.
Earlier in the day, at his weekly media briefing, outgoing Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan reiterated: “Afghanistan has become a central breeding ground for global terrorism.”
He warned the international community against complacency, adding, “We do not have to wait for a big disaster happening at the global scale before we take remedial action. This fire will spread. This has to be stopped.”
No bilateral initiative for talks emerged during the first phase of the truce. How­ever, Qatar, which along with Saudi Arabia had pushed both sides to halt hostilities, offered to host their meeting in Doha. The talks, initially slated for Thursday or Friday, were postponed by a day due to logistical issues and reluctance within the Taliban leadership to engage, sources said.
Reports from Afghanistan suggest that the Taliban delegation would include Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub Mujahid and intelligence chief Mullah Wasiq.  Pakistan’s Foreign Office stayed silent on the matter, but a late-evening meeting between National Security Adviser and ISI chief Lt. Gen. Asim Malik and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar suggested that Gen Malik may travel to Doha.
Return of victims’ remains
Earlier on Friday, Afghan authorities handed over the bodies of seven Pakistani citizens — including two security personnel — to Pakistani officials at the border following the deadly Taliban attack in the Chaman sector on Tuesday.
“The Taliban authorities handed over all the seven bodies to Pakistan through Hilal-e-Ahmar Pakistan (Red Cres­cent),” Abdul Wali Khan Ghabizai of the Balochistan chapter of the organization confirmed. He said Taliban officials announced at the Vesh Mandi border post that they were returning the remains of Pakistanis who had died “in the armed clash between two countries.”
The bodies were taken to the District Hospital in Chaman for identification and medicolegal formalities.
“Five bodies were brought to the district hospital Chaman,” said Dr Muhammad Awais, the hospital’s medical superintendent. “Four out of five martyrs have been identified as residents of the border town, while the fifth could not be identified so far.”
Two of the deceased were identified as security personnel — Naik Suleman and Sepoy Sabir — whose remains were later transferred to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta. Officials said that four of the five civilians were killed by mortar shell splinters, while one was hit in the forehead. The victims — identified as Syed Ali Adozai, Muhammad Asghar Ashaizai, Rozi Khan Salehzai, and Nasibullah Salehzai — were local daily-wage workers. They were buried in their native villages Friday evening.
Local residents in Chaman claimed that at least 12 Pakistani civ­ilians were killed earlier in Taliban attacks in Spin Boldak, the first Afghan district across the border.
Responding to reports that bodies of some Pakistani soldiers had been mutilated, the Foreign Office spokesman at the weekly media briefing said, “This kind of savagery, bestiality, is condemnable, and it needs to be condemned in the strongest words possible. This is beyond the pale. It is beyond humanity, and this has deeply offended us and deeply hurt the Pakistani people.” “It is not something to be forgi­ven and forgotten easily,” Mr Khan added.

ICC ‘appalled’ by deaths of three Afghan cricketers
The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday night issued a
statement
on the deaths of three Afghan cricketers in an airstrike in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, stating it was “deeply saddened and appalled”.
“The three young men had returned home after participating in a friendly cricket match when they were killed in an attack that also claimed the lives of several civilians,” the governing body said.
“The ICC strongly condemns this act of violence that has robbed families, communities, and the cricketing world of three bright talents whose only ambition was to play the sport they loved,” it added.
“The ICC stands in solidarity with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and echoes their grief.”
Afghanistan pulls out of series
In a
post
on social media platform X late Friday night, the ACB said three players — identified as Kabeer, Sibghatullah and Haroon — and “five other countrymen” from Urgun district were killed and seven others were injured in a strike.
It said the players had earlier travelled to Sharana to participate in a friendly cricket match.
“The ACB considers this a great loss for Afghanistan’s sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family,” the cricketing board said. As a result, the ACB decided to withdraw from participating in the tri-nation series scheduled to be played in November.
Afghanistan’s ace spinner Rashid Khan, in a
post
on X, said he welcomed the ACB’s decision to withdraw from the upcoming fixtures against Pakistan.
Pakistan was set to
host
the series from November 17 to 29.
Earlier, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Spokesperson Amir Mir told
Dawn.com
that the tri-series was still on and the third team would be finalised shortly.
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said earlier today that Pakistan had carried out precision strikes in Afghanistan against the outlawed Gul Bahadur group last night.
“All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” he said on X.
Cricket icon Shahid Afridi took to X and said that Afghanistan, in its acts of aggression, had forgotten Pakistan’s hospitality and “favours”.
“Pakistan has always stood by its Afghan brothers, considering the troubles of Afghans as its own trouble,” the former all-rounder wrote. “It opened its borders for its brothers. It accommodated 4 million refugees on its land.
“I have to say that in recent days, Afghanistan, forgetting all these favours, committed open aggression on the borders, to which our forces gave a full response,” he added.
Afridi wrote that Afghanistan should think of Pakistan as a brotherly Islamic country and should not allow its land to be used to aid acts of terrorism.
Pak Afghan tensions
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan
broke
a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence TTP terrorists in Afghanistan and has repeatedly
urged
Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. For its part, Kabul has batted aside accusations of support for militancy, alternating between vehement denials of Afghan soil being used to launch attacks across the border, assurances that have failed to materialise, and simply telling the Pakistani state to negotiate with the TTP.
Tensions have flared between the two countries over the last few days, with Kabul and Islamabad engaging in border skirmishes on October 11. According to the military, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists killed at the border following an attack from the Afghan side.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of
conducting
air strikes in its territory earlier in the week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintained that Kabul must “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
Subsequently, Afghan forces struck several Pak­istani posts and the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and artillery pounded Afghanistan’s posts, targeting hostile positions in the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika.
On Tuesday night, fighting
flared up again
on between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, a temporary ceasefire was then announced. The Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire was implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, and would last for 48 hours.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, however,
made it clear
on Thursday that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks.
“We decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready,” he said, adding that if the Taliban were serious, they would initiate steps to hold talks.
On Friday, with representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan. It had come after an attack on a military installation in North Waziristan and after Islamabad and Kabul
extended
the two-day ceasefire.

May conflict
with the neighbouring country.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an
attack
in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on 7 May, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “
Operation Bunyanum Marsoos
”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a
US-led push
helped broker a ceasefire.
Addressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul, COAS Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.”
Calling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms.
“The onus of ensuing escalations — one that may ultimately bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region and beyond — will squarely lie with India.”
“Should a fresh wave of hostilities be triggered, Pakistan would respond much beyond the expectations of the initiators,” COAS Munir warned.

“With diminishing distinctions between conflict and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India’s geographic warspace.
“The deeply hurting retributive military and economic losses inflicted will be much beyond the imagination and calculation of the perpetrators of chaos and instability,” he said.
“The battle-hardened army, which has fought for over two decades in the sub-conventional domain, has successfully displayed its capabilities in the
conventional domain
, as well as by delivering a swift and decisive blow to the adversary,” he said.
“Ever since the creation of Pakistan, the armed forces, with full support of the nation, have defended the external and internal frontiers of the country with unfailing resolve, conviction and pride.
“The most recent display of this spirit and resolve of the armed forces of Pakistan during
Marka-i-Haq
[and]
Operation Bunyan um Marsoos
has further strengthened the trust and confidence of the people of Pakistan in the competence and far-reaching capabilities of its armed forces by neutralising all threats with remarkable professionalism,” COAS Munir said, referring to the four-day May
conflict with India

“Downing advanced […]

He further said that “people of hues and colours, age, gender, ethnicity or creed, stood firm and tall like a wall of steel, leading to a renewed spirit of patriotism and national fervour, which prevails across the length and breadth of Pakistan”.
“Our collective success has re-energised and strengthened the proud and illustrious memories of our earlier successes. Pakistan once again came out victorious against a treacherous enemy marked by strategic blindness and naivety, and filled with hubris and rhetoric about its misguided hegemonic ambitions.
“India’s eagerness to adjudge culpability, aversion to
neutral investigations
and staking self-created evidence was indicative of politicisation of terrorism for vested interests of the ruling regime,” he added.
COAS Munir went on to say, “Pakistan, on the other hand, gained deep admiration of the people of Pakistan and the international community because of the legitimacy and the clear victory against a numerically superior adversary.
“Internally, it has further unified our nation and strengthened our resolve to defend against any threat, whether external or internal. It has reinforced confidence, particularly amongst the youth, that the armed forces of Pakistan are an essential element of national power and trusted with the responsibility to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state,” he said, assuring the nation that “we will not lose an inch of this sacred land”.
He commended the “valour of the people of Pakistan — every soldier, sailor, airman; the brave men, women and children and the elderly who laid their lives during these testing times; and the warriors who fought with the utmost conviction to defend their motherland at all costs”.
“The national leadership, the bureaucracy, scholars, scientists, media, academia, and most importantly, the youth deserve rich tribute for standing firmly against aggression,” the army chief added.
The army chief also spoke on Pakistan’s economy, hailing the government’s “relentless efforts” for relative stability and noting that positive economic indicators were attracting
investments
from across the world.
“The treasures hidden beneath our land for decades have started to surface as a silver lining for our bright future. Our vibrant youth, filled with talent, is making marvels in a multitude of domains.”
He also reiterated his
cautions
about social media, calling on people to be cognisant of threats “proliferating via digital media, populist anarchism and social subversion”.
“Unfortunately, in the post-truth era in which we live, perceptions bear more weight than reality and half-truths spread faster than facts. Your strength will lie in thinking critically and discerning fact from fiction,” he said, urging them to not become “tools of disinformation”.
Choose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS tells Kabul
The army chief also reiterated Pakistan’s stance that India “continues with state-sponsored terrorism”.
“Our adversary’s use of
Fitna al-Hind
and
Fitna al-Khawarij
as hired guns exposes its … hypocritical and heinous face to the world. Equally disconcerting is the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan,” he said.
Fitna al-Khawarij
is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and
Fitna al Hindustan
for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Urging the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS Munir urged the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”.
“Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”.
Speaking on occupied Kashmir, the army chief said India’s “oppression and widespread atrocities” in the valley will also come to an end. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s diplomatic and moral support for the Kashmiris’ freedom struggle till the resolution of the
dispute
in accordance with United Nations’ resolutions.

‘Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser’
During his address, COAS Munir noted that the world was witnessing “increased fragility and volatility, with a discernible shift towards violence as an instrument for attaining political objectives”.
“Amidst the chaos, Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser. Our relations with key global and regional powers, particularly Muslim countries, have further strengthened.”

The army chief stated that Pakistan had persistently “proven to be a key contributor toward peace and stability in the region and beyond”, highlighting Pakistan’s armed forces’ contributions to UN peacekeeping missions.
He also mentioned the
Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement
between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, terming it a “reinforcement and formalisation of Pakistan-Saudi brotherhood and a step towards ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East and South Asia”.
COAS Munir said Islamabad had also made “humble contributions towards peaceful steering of the negotiations with Iran”, adding that Pakistan’s relations with all Muslim countries were “thriving at an exponential” rate.
Hailing Pakistan’s historic “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership“ with China, the army chief also noted: “Re-energisational and strong and growing relations with the United States of America are an encouraging and welcome development.”
He lauded US President Donald Trump, saying that his “personal efforts and strategic leadership to bring peace to multiple conflict-prone areas of the world are really praiseworthy”.
“We will further nurture these relations with key global and regional players for the interest of peace, security, and development.”
COAS Munir also assailed Israel for its “blatant aggression, genocide and forced displacement waged upon Palestinians”.
Highlighting Pakistan’s “significant” role in the
diplomatic efforts
to secure the recent peace in Gaza, the field marshal said Pakistan expects the
ceasefire
to continue, followed by a smooth flow of humanitarian relief and the reconstruction of Gaza.
“Pakistan stands by its principled stance of indispensability of the two-state solution and the need for an independent, sovereign and viable State of Palestine based on pre-1967 war borders, with Al Quds Sharif as its capital,” he
reaffirmed
.
‘Enemies hell-bent upon driving a wedge between people, armed forces’
Addressing the cadets, he highlighted that they were being commissioned into “one of the finest armies across the world, which is second to none, respected by all and sundry”.
“This demands your absolute loyalty to [Pakistan, to the armed forces and the sacred task being entrusted onto your shoulders,” he underscored.
“Remember, our enemies are hell-bent upon driving a wedge between our people and the armed forces for their ulterior motives. Let me remind them that the bond between the people and the armed forces is unshakable,” the field marshal asserted.
He told the cadets that nothing should be more sacred than the safety and security of the people of Pakistan and no duty more binding than the defence of the country.
“The defence doctrine of Pakistan is predicated on credible deterrence and perpetual readiness, encompassing the full spectrum of capabilities. As a professional standing army, our conventional prowess through constant doctrinal and technological evolution has been optimised into a dynamic, integrated and adaptive force,” the army chief said.
Underscoring the need for intellectual readiness and technological advancements, COAS Munir told the cadets to “embrace innovation, life-long learning and adaptability to meet modern threats”.
At the outset of his address, the army chief extended his warm greetings and appreciation to the “immaculately turned-out gentlemen and lady cadets for the outstanding display of professionalism and discipline”.
He also expressed his compliments to the cadets from friendly countries of Malaysia, Nepal, Palestine, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Yemen, Mali, Maldives, and Nigeria for “successful completion of the formative training at this prestigious institution”.
“This is a moment of pride for you and all of us, reflective of the strong bond of military cooperation and international camaraderie,” COAS Munir said.
He highlighted that the PMA’s role “as a cornerstone of military excellence has always remained commendable, and the standards exhibited today are no less reflective of the same”.",2025-10-18,Dawn.com,2934,0.00028

upcoming three-match series.
According to a press release issued by the country’s cricket board on Saturday, “no decision has been made yet regarding the captaincy of the national team” for the series.
“.. head coach Mike Hesson has formally written to PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, recommending that a joint meeting of the Selection Committee and the Advisory Committee be convened to finalise the captain for the series,” the statement read, adding that the decision will be made as soon as Monday.
The PCB correspondence all but confirms Mohammad Rizwan’s ouster as the Pakistan ODI captain after leading the side to series wins in Australia, Zimbabwe and South Africa last year.
The wicket-keeper-batter, however, had disastrous outings in the ICC Champions Trophy earlier this year — with Pakistan failing to make it past the group stages — before losing away series to New Zealand and the West Indies.
Rizwan’s last ODI captaincy stint was in August against the West Indies — where the Caribbean side sealed a much-needed first ODI series win against Pakistan since 1991, after being swept aside 3-0 and 5-0 in Test and T20 series, respectively, by Australia earlier in the summer.
He was also quietly removed from Pakistan’s T20I captaincy during this time, with Salman Ali Agha taking over.
As per ongoing speculations and unconfirmed reports circulating on different media and social media platforms, Pakistan pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi is highly likely to replace Rizwan as Pakistan kick off their preparations for the 2027 World Cup with the South Africa series from November 4.
The Mohsin-led PCB regime, since February 2024, has made wholesale changes. It first removed Shaheen as captain to bring back Babar Azam as white-ball skipper in the first half of 2024.
Shaheen was previously appointed the T20I captain after Babar stepped down from captaincy in all formats following Pakistan’s disastrous campaign at the ODI World Cup 2023 in India.
Later, Babar, owing to the team’s poor performance in the T20 World Cup, decided to step down, after which Mohammad Rizwan was given the reins of white-ball team.",2025-10-18,Dawn.com,556,0.000102

Just like their 3-3 draw against Australia in their last round-robin match the other day, Pakistan were once again guilty of conceding early goals and despite having levelled the match at 2-2 in the 54th minute, they were eventually undone by Markham’s strike three minutes from time.
Great Britain, who had finished third in the round-robin table — one spot ahead of Pakistan, made a fast start and raced into a two-goal lead in the first quarter. Kaden Dreysey captalised on a penalty corner in the seventh minute before Michael Royden added the second in the 12th.
Captain Abdul Hannan Shahid’s field goal reduced the deficit in the 23rd but despite Sufyan Khan’s drag-flick expertise coming to the fore in the final quarter, it wasn’t enough for Pakistan.

Federal Minister for IT and Telecom Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Ambassador of Saudi Arabia to Pakistan Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki and others launched the initiative.
The AI Hub will help promote AI research, knowledge exchange, digital capacity building and co-creation of technology solutions to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the digital domain.
Minister Shaza Fatima said GO AI Hub was not a traditional agreement or a one-time transaction, but a sustainable digital platform enabling Pakistani professionals and entrepreneurs to engage directly with Saudi businesses without the need to travel or spend additional resources. “Through this hub, Pakistani freelancers can offer their services to Saudi companies remotely,” she said.
The minister said a major investment in data infrastructure would follow, supporting Pakistan’s growing digital ecosystem. She termed the project the first drop of many to come, and expressed confidence that Pakistan would soon witness billions of dollars in new investments.

Ms Khawaja added that Pakistan is now witnessing tangible results, with visible growth in investment, emerging technological talent, and expanding centers of artificial intelligence across the country. The minister expressed optimism that the 17 newly-signed
agreements
between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in the IT sector would further enhance cooperation.
The Saudi ambassador said that the company has already achieved success with a hub in Silicon Valley, USA, and is now bringing that vision to Pakistan.
“We look forward to more projects that will strengthen the strategic partnership between our two countries,” he added.
GO Group CEO Yahya bin Saleh Al-Mansour said the launch of the Hub in Islamabad, following the first established in Silicon Valley marked a new chapter in Saudi-Pakistan cooperation in artificial intelligence, digital innovation and ICT development. He added that the launch of the Hub in Islamabad signifies the company’s confidence in Pakistan’s digital ecosystem, talented youth, and innovation potential.
He added that the GO group will invest in data centres and cybersecurity infrastructure.
He invited Pakistani companies and institutions to engage with the GO AI Hub to explore AI-led opportunities in the Saudi market.
Also present on the occasion were National Coordinator SIFC Gen Sarfaraz Ahmed, PSEB CEO Abu Bakar and others.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949764/45-electric-buses-arrive-in-rawalpindi,45 electric buses arrive in Rawalpindi - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"RAWALPINDI: As many as 45 electric buses have arrived in the garrison city to operate on 10 routes.
However, the service is likely to start in November as the Punjab Masstransit Authority (PMA) and Regional Transport Authority (RTA) are completing final arrangements.
A total of
80
electric buses will operate on the roads of Rawalpindi, but in the initial phase, 45 buses have arrived for the city, while 15 have been dispatched to Gujar Khan. The Punjab Masstransit Authority will supervise the buses in Rawalpindi, whereas the Punjab Transport Company will manage those in Gujar Khan.
Earlier, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was scheduled to inaugurate the new transport system in the garrison city on October 15, but the ceremony was cancelled due to the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan
protest
in Islamabad.
Uzair Shah, General Manager (Operations) at the Punjab Masstransit Authority, told
Dawn
that the PMA had completed the arrangements for charging stations and the bus depot. “The buses will start operating next month,” he said.
l  Total of 80 buses to ply on roads in garrison city  l  Punjab Masstransit Authority, RTA finalise arrangements to start operations on 10 routes in November
He added that, under the law, the Punjab Masstransit Authority has the mandate to operate feeder buses for the Metro Bus Service. “All electric buses in Rawalpindi, Lahore and Multan will be managed by the PMA, while the Punjab Transport Company will oversee operations in other parts of the province,” he said.
According to Mr Shah, the fare for the new service will range between Rs20 and Rs25. “A total of 120 electric buses will run in Rawalpindi. In the first phase, 45 buses have arrived, and another 35 will arrive next month,” he added.
Regarding bus stops, he said shelters to protect passengers from rain and sun would be built by the Regional Transport Authority. “Construction will begin as soon as the buses hit the roads,” he said.
He added that the new electric buses would be linked with the Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metro Bus Service, providing a comfortable and affordable commuting option for citizens.
On the other hand, Regional Transport Authority (RTA) Secretary Asad Shirazi told
Dawn
that the RTA was assisting the PMA in executing the electric bus system in Rawalpindi.
“The main bus depot is being constructed at the old General Bus Service site on Peshawar Road,” he said.
“As the depot’s construction will take three to four months, we have temporarily developed a facility in Saddar on Adamjee Road at the General Bus Service stand. Some buses are also parked at the Metro Bus offices,” he added.
Mr Shirazi said the bus service would provide much-needed relief to the public. “Due to limited parking space, we will initially start with 45 buses in November,” he said.
He added that bus shelters would soon be constructed in collaboration with the Punjab Transport Department and the district administration. “The fare has been fixed, and monthly travel cards will also be introduced for regular passengers,” he said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949834/pms-adviser-warns-of-firm-response-to-any-attack,PM’s adviser warns of ‘firm response’ to any attack - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Saturday reiterated Islamabad’s stance that Pakistan will not be an aggressor, but warned that it will respond firmly to any attack.
“Our policy is very clear: Pakistan will not initiate aggression against any neighbouring country,” Mr Sanaullah told rep­orters. “But if anyone attacks us, we will not leave that unanswered.” He added that the response may exceed what some have referred to as “score zero six,” — a reference to Pakistan’s
downing
of six Indian aircraft in the May 2025 war.
Speaking about relations with Afgha­nistan, the adviser said Pakistan had consistently supported its neighbour and expressed deep regret over repeated incidents that have cost Pakistani lives. “We have always stood with Afghanistan. It pains us that we continue to suffer from that side,” he said. “We cannot keep carrying the coffins of our loved officers.”
Expresses regret over cross-border incidents from Afghanistan
Mr Sanaullah urged that a clear distinction be made between civilians and terrorists. “From now on, differentiate clearly between terrorists and ordinary people. If someone subscribes to an ideology of violence and terrorism and stands opposed to the state, there can be no dialogue with them,” he said.
Turning to allegations of external involvement in militant activity, he accused India of complicity. “India is involved — to such an extent that it didn’t even bother to deny it. They are culpable,” he told the media. At the same time, he dismissed any suggestion that New Delhi could mount a ground invasion, warning that Pakistan’s armed forces would respond robustly if provoked. “India does not have the capacity to overrun us. If it attempts anything, our armed forces will strike back,” he said.
On the domestic front, the adviser said Punjab was ready for local government elections and pledged that the process would extend “down to the streets and neighbourhoods,” giving ordinary citizens opportunities to participate in governance.
Responding to a question about a circulating video clip of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in which a small national flag was seen on his table while larger PTI and KP flags were displayed in the background, Mr Sanaullah said the footage had been edited. “There has been editing in the matter of the flags,” he said without elaborating.

• Red Zone area briefly opened to repatriate Afghan refugees
QUETTA: Calm prevailed on both sides of the Pak-Afghan border on Saturday after the extension of a ceasefire between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban forces, with no untoward incident reported from any area of the Chaman sector, where heavy
clashes
had erupted in the early hours of Tuesday last week.
Although the border crossings at Chaman and other entry points have closed for the past six days, Pakistan partially
reopened
the border in the Red Zone area to facilitate the repatriation of undocumented Afghan refugees.
“Under tight security, several hundred Afghan refugee families, including women and children, along with their belongings crossed into the Afghanistan over the past three days, a senior official said.
The border was opened for three days, while it remained closed for the other three due to intense fighting at four locations in the Chaman sector,” he added.
Following the
ceasefire
, no firing or attack was reported from either side. “Forces equipped with heavy weapons remain on high alert to respond to any situation,” the official said. The Friendship Gate at the Pak-Afghan border remains intact on the Pakistani side, while the Afghan Taliban damaged the gate on their side.
The Inspector General of Fron­t­ier Corps (North) Balochistan re­­c­e­ntly visited the Chaman border, where he was briefed by senior Frontier Corps commanders on the situation following the armed cla­shes. He also visited Pakistani border posts and the Friendship Gate.
The border, however, remains completely closed for all other purposes — including Afghan transit trade, imports, exports, and cross-border business — for the past six days.
Hundreds of loaded trucks and trailers carrying Afghan transit goods, fresh fruits, vegetables, and other commodities have been stranded on both sides of the border. “Around 140 trucks loaded with grapes and pomegranates are waiting in the Vesh Mandi area of Afghanistan to transport consignments to Quetta and other Pakistani cities,” officials said.
Similarly, over 500 loaded trucks carrying Afghan transit goods and import-export items have been stranded on the Pakistani side of the border in Chaman since the clashes began.
The business community engaged in cross-border trade has reported heavy financial losses, as perishable goods — particularly fruits and vegetables — are spoiling due to the prolonged closure.
Traders’ organisations, including the Chaman Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have expressed serious concern over the situation and urged authorities to reopen the border to prevent further economic losses.

• Justice Arbab Tahir to hear petition along with office’s objections on Monday
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court has raised objections to a
petition
filed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi seeking permission to meet PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala jail.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir is scheduled to hear the petition, along with the registrar office’s objections, on Monday.
The petition was submitted by KP Advocate General Shah Faisal through Advocate Ali Bukhari on behalf of the provincial chief minister. The petition argued that a meeting with the PTI founder was essential to discuss matters pertaining to provincial governance and the formation of a new cabinet.
However, the IHC registrar’s office objected to the maintainability of the plea, noting that the court had already adjudicated similar matters and had laid down a procedure for seeking permission to meet the PTI founder. The office questioned how a new petition could be filed without following the prescribed process.
The move came after CM Afridi was
denied
a meeting with PTI founder at Adiala jail. Following the refusal, the KP government approached the IHC, naming the federal and Punjab interior secretaries, the inspector general of Punjab Police, and the superintendent of Adiala jail as respondents.
According to the petition, the KP government had earlier submitted formal requests to the federal interior ministry and the Punjab home department to allow the meeting, but no approval was granted. The plea maintained that consultation with the PTI founder was “legally and ethically necessary” for the chief minister in connection with key administrative and political decisions, including cabinet formation.
Advocate General Shah Faisal, who verified his biometrics at the IHC under a special power of attorney, told reporters that CM Afridi had personally attempted to meet the PTI founder but was denied access despite having sought the prime minister’s permission. He added that the chief minister also intended to raise the matter before the Chief Justice of Pakistan on the administrative side and might approach the Supreme Court if necessary.
PTI leader and counsel Ali Bukhari said the ban on political meetings, imposed on November 26 last year, was contrary to the Pakistan Prisons Rules and violated visitation rights. He argued that even court directions regarding such rights were being disregarded, asserting that “meetings with inmates are a right, not a privilege.”
The petition requested the court to direct the jail authorities to immediately allow a meeting between the KP chief minister and the PTI founder, and to issue guidelines for future consultations as part of routine governance communication. The IHC will take up the petition, along with objections, for hearing on Monday.

Amid heightened tensions along the Pak-Afghan border, a high-level Pakistani delegation led by Asif travelled to Doha on Saturday for
talks
with Afghan Taliban officials, aimed at ending cross-border hostilities and addressing Pakistan’s security concerns.  Facilitated by Qatar, the talks followed days of clashes and Pakistani
strikes
on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, after a
48-hour ceasefire
was extended to allow negotiations.
In a post on X, the minister announced, “A ceasefire agreement has been finalised. The terrorist attacks from Afghanistan on Pakistan’s soil will cease immediately. Both neighbouring countries will respect each other’s territory,” adding that delegations will meet again in Istanbul on October 25 to discuss matters in detail.
“We are sincerely grateful to both brotherly countries, Qatar and Turkiye,” the minister said.
Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar welcomed the announcement, calling it a “step in the right direction.”
Taking to X, FM Dar said, “[I] welcome the agreement finalised late last night in Doha. It is the first step in the right direction.”
“Deeply appreciate the constructive role played by brotherly Qatar and Turkiye,’ he added.
Dar expressed hope for the establishment of a “concrete and verifiable monitoring mechanism” to tackle terrorism “emanating from Afghan soil” in the upcoming Istanbul meeting.
He stressed that “it is important to put all efforts in place to prevent any further loss of lives.”
Separately, the spokesperson for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, Zabiullah Mujahid, in a statement issued on Sunday, said: “Negotiations between representatives of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, held in Qatar, have concluded with the signing of a bilateral agreement.”
“Under the terms of the agreement, both sides reaffirm their commitment to peace, mutual respect, and the maintenance of strong and constructive [neighbourly] relations,” the statement added.
As per the statement, both countries mutually agreed that “neither country will undertake any hostile actions against the other, nor will they support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan.”
“Both sides will refrain from targeting each other’s security forces, civilians, or critical infrastructure,” it added.
Underscoring commitment towards diplomacy, the statement said: “Both sides are committed to resolving issues and disputes through dialogue”, detailing that “a comprehensive and meaningful ceasefire has been mutually agreed upon.”
“In the future, a mechanism will be established, under the mediation of intermediary countries, to review bilateral claims and ensure the effective implementation of this agreement,” it said.
The spokesperson also extended appreciation to Qatar and Turkiye for their role in facilitating the agreement.
In a subsequent post, he referred to the phrase “nor will they support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan” in his earlier statement. Mujahid clarified that it had been the the permanent position of  the Islamic Emirate that “it does not allow the use of Afghan territory against any other country”.
“It (The Islamic Emirate) does not support any attack against anyone and has always emphasised this stance,” he added.
Earlier, a post on the X account of
PTV News
, citing the Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had also confirmed the development.
“During the talks, both countries not only agreed on an immediate ceasefire but also decided to establish a permanent mechanism for bilateral peace and stability,” the post said.
The post further noted that both countries will hold follow-up meetings in the coming days to ensure the implementation and sustained continuity of the ceasefire.
“These measures will prove beneficial in promoting security and stability in both Pakistan and Afghanistan,” it said.
According to the post, the negotiations, hosted by the State of Qatar with Turkiye acting as mediator, continued for 13 hours.
For its part, Qatar also uploaded a statement on X announcing the ceasefire. In the statement by the foreign ministry, Qatar expressed the hope that “this important step will contribute to ending tensions on the border between the two brotherly countries and form a solid foundation for sustainable peace in the region”.
However, the statement on the development on the foreign ministry’s website omitted the word “border” from this sentence.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office did not immediately comment on the difference in the statements.
Meanwhile, many
saw
the omission of the word border from the statement as a diplomatic victory for the Afghan Taliban, who have long refused to recognise the Durand Line as the legitimate border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
On Saturday, as talks were underway between the two sides, Pakistan had reiterated that it did not seek escalation. However, it urged the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities, a statement from the FO had
said
.
“Pakistan appreciates the mediation efforts of Qatar and hopes these discussions contribute to peace and stability in the region,“ it had added.
Cross-border escalation
On the night of October 11, Afghan forces launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistani border posts, sparking a series of
clashes
that left 23 Pakistani soldiers martyred and over 200 Taliban and affiliated militants dead, according to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The Pakistan military responded with precision strikes inside Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul, targeting militant camps and border positions, while urging Kabul to act against terrorist groups operating from its soil.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the border attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting
air strikes
in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has
neither confirmed nor denied
.
Clashes broke out again on Tuesday (Oct.14), with the Afghan Taliban and
Fitna al Khawarij
exchanging
fire with Pakistan troops at the Kurram border. Pakistan followed this on Wednesday by launching “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul.
Fitna al Khawarij
is a term the state uses to refer to the terrorists affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The FO on Wednesday announced that a
temporary ceasefire
had been agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid the recent border hostilities. Later on Friday, the ceasefire was
extended
, according to a senior diplomatic source.
Additionally, Pakistan again
targeted
terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan that same day. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a
military installation
in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire.
Deteriorating ties
Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have remained strained since 2023, with Pakistan repeatedly
raising concerns
over the
use of Afghan soil
by militants carrying out cross-border attacks. The security situation has deteriorated further in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan following the outlawed TTP’s decision to
end its ceasefire
with Islamabad in November 2022.
While the two sides have attempted to hold dialogue from time to time, tensions have persisted.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949852/measured-response,Measured response - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE government’s decision to
shut down
all Afghan refugee camps and deny any further extension for their stay marks a new phase in a complex and painful chapter of Pakistan’s history.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s directive for the “dignified repatriation” of Afghan nationals — with more exit points to be established along the border — underscores Islamabad’s desire to address economic and security pressures.
Yet, this moment also demands empathy, restraint and a humane approach that matches the spirit of generosity Pakistan has displayed for over four decades. Since 1979, Pakistan has hosted one of the world’s largest refugee populations — at times sheltering more than 3m Afghans — despite its own economic hardships and political turmoil.
This act of hospitality has earned the country considerable goodwill and global respect. But the current policy, which explicitly links repatriation to Kabul’s failure to curb cross-border militancy, risks blurring the line between legitimate security concerns and humanitarian obligations. Refugees cannot be treated as extensions of a government from which many have fled in fear or desperation.
The Taliban’s
return
to power in 2021 prompted a new wave of displacement, with many Afghans escaping persecution, repression, and poverty. For such individuals, forced or abrupt repatriation could mean exposure to grave danger and renewed trauma.
The prime minister has rightly spoken of ensuring a “dignified and humane” process, with care for women, children, minorities and the elderly. But ensuring that this comes into practice requires international oversight, logistical support, and close coordination with the UNHCR, aid partners, and humanitarian agencies to ensure that returnees have safety, shelter, and viable livelihood options on arrival.
There is also a practical dimension. Many Afghans — some born and raised entirely in Pakistan — have integrated into local communities, contributing to labour markets, small businesses, education, and cultural life. Displacement for them is not a return but an uprooting that will reshape countless lives and neighbourhoods. A more nuanced approach is needed: those with legal status or deep social ties should be offered regularisation pathways, while repatriation for others must proceed when conditions across the border are stable and safe.
Pakistan’s frustration with Kabul over security issues is understandable, but refugee policy must not become an instrument of political signalling or retaliation. Instead, Islamabad should frame its approach as part of a larger humanitarian effort, seeking global funding and cooperation for reintegration programmes.
The world owes Pakistan support for shouldering this burden for so long. That support must now translate into meaningful aid, sustained diplomatic engagement, and a shared commitment to justice, dignity, and long-term stability. As the government proceeds, it must ensure that compassion remains its guiding principle. Dignity in repatriation cannot exist without humanity in intent.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949853/talibans-new-ploy,Taliban’s new ploy - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE Afghan Taliban regime is living under an illusion. Visiting India, its interim foreign minister recently stated that Afghanistan had defeated the British, the Soviets and the Americans. No, they had not. The Afghan rulers of the time were decisively defeated in the second Anglo-Afghan war (1878-80) by the British, enabling the latter to effectively make Afghanistan a buffer zone in the Great Game between the Raj and the Russian empire. Abdul Rahman Khan accepted the Durand Line as the border with British India, which was endorsed by subsequent Afghan rulers. As for the Soviets, it was the concerted effort by the US and Pakistan that pushed them out and rescued the Afghan people in the 1980s. America’s presence in Afghanistan since 2001 also ended only when the US itself decided to exit in August 2021 because of American public opinion turning against distant wars and the strategic depth the Taliban had received in Pakistan.
For over four years now, the world has expected the Taliban to honour their commitments under the 2020 Doha peace accord with the US. However, they have violated all three promises: forming a true representative government, respecting women’s rights, and not allowing terrorist entities on Afghan soil.
With Pakistan, the Taliban have adopted a particularly hostile attitude, having lately embarked upon a two-pronged manoeuvre. The first prong is teaming up with India to not only benefit from Indian investments in healthcare, education and infrastructure, but to also doubly squeeze Pakistan under the mistaken belief that Pakistan’s enemy is their friend. For its part, India, which has severely criticised Taliban in the past, has reversed its policy in order to leverage the Taliban against Pakistan, just as the Taliban are leveraging it against Pakistan. India hopes to wean the Taliban further away from Pakistan and even China.
The second prong is an upsurge in the Taliban’s kinetic aggression to destabilise the Pak-Afghan border (Oct 11-12, 2025) while ignoring Pakistan’s consistent protests against the Taliban’s support to the TTP (and other anti-Pakistan elements) who have killed children and other innocent civilians in Pakistan. For now, Pakistan has repulsed the assaults and inflicted heavy losses on the Taliban forces and their TTP associates. However, it is evident that the Taliban won’t heed Pakistan’s advice to not allow terrorist elements on their soil. Instead, the Afghan leadership tends to shift the burden of any action to Pakistan, arguing that these terrorists should be handled inside this country. The Taliban media is also spreading disinformation, taking a leaf out of the Indian media’s playbook.
Why are the Taliban inimical towards Pakistan?
Why are the Taliban so ungrateful and inimical towards Pakistan? It appears that they are trying to be nationalist in order to garner support from the wider Afghan society. Perhaps they wish to give the impression that they aren’t under Pakistan’s influence. They are hosting the TTP probably as a leverage against Pakistan. In doing all this, they are overestimating their power potential, and may be in for a rude shock. It would be prudent for them not to underestimate Pakistan’s resolve to defend its borders and defeat Taliban-backed terrorists.
How should Pakistan deal with the Taliban? Several steps can be considered in the immediate term: One, Pakistan should maintain its robust defence at the borders with Afghanistan (and India). Only strength can deter aggression. Two, it should send a clear message to Kabul that the doors for dialogue are open, provided the Taliban firmly commit to ending their support to the TTP. If they do not commit to that, then kinetic options wou­ld remain on the table. Three, Paki­s­tan must keep up the pressure on the Taliban through diplomatic outreach to Saudi Arabia (now a partner in mutual defence), China, Russia, Iran, the Central Asian Republics, Turkiye, the UAE and America. Given the Taliban’s past association with Al Qaeda, the global community would not want to see the Taliban hosting terrorist entities again. Pakistan should also register its complaints in the UN under the UNSCR 1988 (1267) sanctions regime.
In the medium term, Pakistan should develop a nationwide consensus on a review of its previously generous policies regarding Afghan refugees, scholarships for Afghan students, special desks in its hospitals for Afghans, collecting custom duties on transit trade through Pakistani ports, and media outreach to Afghan society. Experts could be invited to suggest doable measures. In the long term, an effort could be mounted to win the hearts and minds of our nationals living in the erstwhile Fata region bordering Afghanistan through development work. They are the first line of defence against terrorism from Afghanistan.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949856/another-doha-pact,Another Doha pact - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THERE is little optimism or even enthusiasm surrounding the post-ceasefire talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan taking place in Doha. Yet, it would be unwise to dismiss them outright. If one assesses the potential pragmatically, these discussions could evolve into a ‘Doha pact’ of their own, echoing the 2021
agreement
between the Taliban and the US that altered the regional geopolitical landscape.
Facilitated by Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the Taliban have agreed to sit down with their Pakistani counterparts in Doha to discuss bilateral relations and the possible extension of the ceasefire, which was initially agreed upon for just 48 hours after recent border clashes between the two countries.
Should the two sides reach an understanding akin to the earlier Doha accord, where the Taliban provide verifiable guarantees that the TTP and other Afghan-based militants will not operate against Pakistan, it could prove transformative. Such an agreement would not only redefine the troubled bilateral relationship but could also reshape the regional landscape. The prospects for transnational connectivity, trade and mega infrastructure projects linking Central and South Asia would expand dramatically, offering tangible improvements to the lives of millions across the region.
However, the Taliban leadership does not have such a vision, and the major problem with the Taliban leadership lies in its deeply conventional mindset in both political and religious thinking. This rigidity stems mainly from their madressah education, whether in Pakistan or Afghanistan. Most of their leaders, whether graduates or dropouts, share the same worldview, cutting across all factions and shades of leadership, from the so-called ‘moderates’ like Abbas Stanikzai to the Haqqanis and hardliners such as Mullah Abdul Hakim Haqqani.
The Taliban perceive the world as something that must learn to accommodate them.
They perceive the world as something that must learn to accommodate them or strive to understand them, while they see no reason to change themselves. They consider themselves victorious, having defeated great powers, and believe the world should now deal with them on their terms. Consequently, they show little willingness to reconsider their orthodox, religiously driven policies of moral policing or their severe restrictions on women and other vulnerable segments of society, despite appeals from respected religious scholars across the Islamic world.
Their mindset is incompatible with evolving global norms, and even with the political realities of authoritarian yet relatively modern Muslim societies. Why, then, should others be expected to give them time or understand their so-called compulsions, which they often cite when discussing terrorism-related issues with Pakistan and neighbouring countries? Why should Pakistan and others continue to listen to them and at what cost? Must Pakistan continue to bleed at the hands of the TTP and other militant groups while the Taliban offer themselves as mediators between the state and terrorists?
In contrast, when militant groups rooted in Al Qaeda and Daesh captured parts of Syria, their behaviour, both internally and in their engagement with the world, was notably different. One understands that Afghanistan is not Syria. Syria, despite its devastation, is attempting to rebuild through a fragile but ongoing national consensus and is showing a willingness to align, at least partially, with regional and global norms. The Taliban, by comparison, have failed to foster any such consensus at home.
Unlike in Syria, where elements of the leadership remain visible, reachable, and at times open to dialogue with world powers, including the US and Russia, the Taliban’s supreme leader, Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, remains hidden. The reasons for his seclusion are unclear. Officially, it is attributed to ‘security concerns’, but these explanations no longer hold much weight. What is he afraid of? Lack of confidence, fear of dissent, or simply an inability to step out of a wartime mindset? No one truly knows who is making decisions on his behalf. The Taliban’s internal communications are riddled with contradictions, and myths continue to swirl around their leadership.
One recent example illustrates this opacity and confusion. Reports emerged that Mullah Hibatullah had ordered an internet
shutdown
across Afghanistan, citing concerns that WhatsApp and other social media apps were spreading obscenity, vulgarity, and music. Yet, just a few days later, he reportedly asked an aide why he was no longer receiving WhatsApp messages. When informed that the services had been suspended on his own orders, he reluctantly directed that internet access be restored.
Such incidents, while almost absurd on the surface, reveal a deeper problem within the Taliban’s governance structure — a leadership trapped between ideological rigidity and the demands of a connected, modern world.
The Taliban leadership is neither innovative nor forward-looking in shaping better relations with its neighbours, particularly Pakistan and China, despite the long-term advantages such engagement could bring. Instead, they continue to rely on the old Afghan template of suspicion and defiance towards Pakistan, a posture that frustrates Islamabad even more than the persistent terrorist threat the country faces daily.
India, fully aware of these sensitivities, has been quick to exploit the Taliban’s posture to its advantage, skilfully playing on Pakistan’s insecurities. For the Taliban, this dynamic serves as a convenient balancing act, using the Indian card to counter Pakistan’s pressure on issues of terrorism and border security-related affairs.
In Doha, the Taliban are unlikely to change. Neither Qatar nor Saudi Arabia possess the leverage to compel them to abandon their closest militant ally, the TTP. China, too, has failed to persuade them on this issue, and it remains unclear what strategy the Gulf mediators can employ to convince the Taliban to address Pakistan’s concerns about cross-border terrorism seriously. The likelihood is that the Taliban will continue to deny responsibility, insisting that the TTP problem is an ‘internal matter’ for Pakistan and offering, at best, vague proposals for dialogue.
To avoid embarrassing their hosts, the ceasefire between Afghanistan and Pakistan may be extended for a few weeks. But the real solution does not lie in diplomatic gestures or temporary truces. It lies in the Taliban’s willingness to completely sever ties with all forms of terrorism, something they had promised to the US in the original Doha Agreement, and a commitment they may now be compelled to make once again, this time to Pakistan.

Hyperspectral imaging is a type of advanced camera technology used in satellites to study the Earth and space, according to a study published in the Journal of Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience.
Unlike regular satellite cameras that capture only a few colours (like red, green, and blue), hyperspectral cameras capture hundreds of very narrow colour bands. This means they can detect tiny differences in light that the human eye, or even normal satellites, can’t see.
In a statement issued today, Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said, “The nation’s space agency today announced a breakthrough achievement with the successful launch of Pakistan’s first Hyperspectral Satellite (HS-1) from China.”
View this post on Instagram
Detailing the function of the satellite, the statement said, “HS-1 satellite is engineered to capture ultra-precise hyperspectral imagery across hundreds of narrow spectral bands, offering unprecedented resolution for the analysis of land, vegetation, water, and urban features.”
“The cutting-edge technology is set to fundamentally transform Pakistan’s capacity in precision agriculture, rigorous environmental monitoring, urban planning, and proactive disaster management,” it said.
“HS-1 will empower the nation to precisely map crop vitality, soil moisture, and water quality, while rigorously tracking deforestation, pollution, and glacial melt.”
It added that the satellite will “enhance early warning systems and post-disaster assessments for catastrophic events like floods and landslides, especially across the northern regions”.
Per the agency, the satellite is also expected to aid “development initiatives such as CPEC by preemptively identifying geo-hazard risks and guiding sustainable infrastructure development”.
Chairman Suparco, Muhammad Yousaf Khan, “expressed profound gratitude for the Government of Pakistan’s support in bringing this pivotal national project to fruition”, the statement quoted him as saying.
“The data from the Hyperspectral Satellite is poised to revolutionise agricultural productivity, bolster climate resilience, and enable optimised management of the country’s vital natural resources.”
Underscoring the long-standing partnership between Pakistan and China in space science, the space agency continued: “The mission reflects the ever-growing strategic partnership and deep-rooted friendship between the two nations, who continue to cooperate in advancing peaceful space exploration and harnessing its benefits for socioeconomic development.”
“HS-1’s successful integration into Pakistan’s expanding space fleet marks a decisive step toward solidifying space technology excellence and reinforces Suparco’s vital role in driving national socioeconomic growth through innovative space applications.”
According to the press release, Project Director HS-1 Mushtaque Hussain Soomro stressed that the satellite “signals a definitive leap in Pakistan’s ambitious space roadmap, positioning the nation as an emerging leader in space technology for sustainable development”.
He also hailed the mission team’s collective dedication and technical brilliance, the statement said.
In a statement from his office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his appreciation for Pakistani engineers and scientists for the successful launch.
“The cooperation between Pakistan and China in space research, like in other sectors, is exemplary and of key importance,” the PM was quoted as saying. “We are grateful to our great and long-standing friend and strategic partner, China, for this exemplary collaboration.
“The hearts of Pakistanis beat with the Chinese people and leadership,” he added.
According to the statement,  the satellite will help Pakistan research environmental changes and geographical variations.
“This progress will prove to be an important milestone in combating the harmful effects of climate change,” PM Shehbaz said. “The satellite will significantly increase national capabilities in areas such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning and disaster management.”
Separately, in a statement issued today, the foreign office termed the development a major milestone and called it “a pivotal step forward in Pakistan’s space programme.”
FO said that the launch “reaffirms Suparco’s commitment to leveraging space technology for national development.”
It also “highlights the long-standing collaboration between Pakistan and China in the peaceful exploration of space and its application for socioeconomic progress.”
“Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar commended the scientists/technical teams from Pakistan and China working on HS-1 for their commitment, professional excellence and exemplary cooperation,” the statement said.
On October 15, Suparco
announced
the upcoming launch of the HS-1 satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in China.
Last month, a senior official from Suparco said the agency was
integrating
space-based applications into its disaster risk management framework, “paving a path anchored in science and international collaboration to better prepare for natural calamities”.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). Any IQAir AQI ranking above 150 is considered “unhealthy” and above 200 is considered “very unhealthy”.
The AQI
reading
for Lahore stood at a very unhealthy 189; it was just beaten by Delhi, which registered a reading of 212 around 7:30pm.
Additionally, levels of the pollutant PM2.5 were
measured
at 109 microgrammes per cubic metre of air (μg/m³), 21.8 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s annual PM2.5 guidelines.
PM2.5 particles are floating particulate matter in the air measuring 2.5 micrometres in diameter or less, according to IQAir. PM2.5 is so small that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream upon inhalation.
IQAir recommended on its website that residents in Lahore avoid outdoor exercise, run air purifiers and prioritise wearing masks. It also recommended closing all windows to avoid dirty air from outdoors.
Lahore has historically dealt with smog and poor air quality in the winter months.
Around this time
last year
, the air quality in Lahore was recorded at 394 amid the smog crisis, primarily fuelled by crop residue burning and industrial emissions. The smog caused widespread health issues among residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation and skin infections.
To combat smog this year, the Punjab government has introduced ‘
smog guns
’, with Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb stating that they were already in use across Lahore.
“Through this modern machine, tiny droplets of water are sprayed into the air to combat smog,“ she explained. “The water mist helps clean pollution and dust particles present in the atmosphere. This modern machinery is also being used in countries like China, India, and others to reduce smog.”",2025-10-19,Dawn.com,515,9.9e-05

• 95 bank accounts identified; parleys continue over fate of seminaries administered by the group
LAHORE: Authorities in Punjab claim to have traced the whereabouts of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas, saying the absconding leaders fled to Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) after the
Muridke crackdown
.
A senior official told
Dawn
that law enforcers had shared this information with AJK authorities and sought their help to nab the TLP leaders. The development follows speculation — fuelled by TLP circles — that their party chief was in custody.
The official said following the crackdown, several teams comprising senior officers from Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies had been tasked with tracking down the TLP chief and his brother.
He said Saad Rizvi and his brother were first spotted walking away from the protest camp in Muridke, and then fleeing on a motorbike.
At that time, an emergency message was circulated among the LEAs that a motorcycle rider carrying the TLP chief and his brother had moved towards nearby streets.
The three suspects, however, managed to dodge law enforcement personnel, any many rumours started to surface on social media regarding possible injury to them.
The officer said the special teams eventually traced the last location of the TLP leaders somewhere in AJK and sought the regional government’s help for their arrest.
It may be recalled that the Punjab government has
formally sought the proscription of TLP
and has sent a summary in this regard to the federal government.
Meanwhile, the Federal Inves­tigation Agency also traced nearly 95 bank accounts operated by the TLP chief, Saad Rizvi, the official said.
Of them, 15 were interest-bearing accounts, and the FIA was trying to get more details from the relevant banks to check the transactions made by the TLP chief, he added.
TLP seminaries
As a part of a wider crackdown on the radical outfit, the Punjab government also identified 61 seminaries run by the TLP across the province. The issue of these seminaries also came up during a meeting of Sunni clerics with the provincial authorities, as both sides discussed proposals about the fate of these institutions.
During the meeting, two proposals came under discussion to decide the future of these seminaries. It was suggested in the meeting that these seminaries be given under the administrative control of the Punjab Auqaf Department — this suggestion, however, was opposed by the majority of the participants who feared such a move would aggravate the situation. They said this action may create controversies in the future, particularly due to the huge financial expenses.
The second proposal pertained to handing over these seminaries to the moderate Sunni clerics – a move deemed workable. However, the authorities said in such a case, the clerics would run the TLP seminaries without the element of ‘militancy’. But a final decision on the fate of these seminaries is yet to be taken.
Meanwhile, the Multan district administration sealed 10 TLP seminaries and handed several over to the Auqaf department in line with the Punjab government’s orders. These seminaries were located in Multan, Shujabad, and Basti Malook.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950063/literary-notes-putting-urdu-criticism-on-world-literary-map,literary notes: Putting Urdu criticism on world literary map - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"POSTCOLONIAL discourse is not anything new: back in 1978 with the publication of Edward Said’s book Orientalism the postcolonial studies had emerged on the academic scene with a bang. But in Pakistan it was something almost unheard of till the late 1990s. Though a few Urdu books on critical theories did discuss the impact of colonial and imperial policies on Urdu language and literature — especially some progressive writers and critics with a traditionalist bent of mind had criticised the exploitative nature of the colonial policies — no detailed and organised study on the topic existed in Urdu.
Dr Nasir Abbas Nayyar began writing research papers in Urdu on postcolonialism and his book Maba’d Nauabadiyaat: Urdu Ke Tanazur Mein, first published in 2013, was a pioneering effort in the field. The book, adorned with proper references, opened up the discourse to a readership that did not have direct access to the works published in English on the issues related to postcolonial studies. Nayyar’s book crystalised the notion that postcolonial discourse was not merely a literary or critical one but it was also a theoretical framework to understand the political, historical and cultural impact of colonialism. Nayyar has first presented the boundaries and distinctions of postcolonialism, then explained the knowledge and power in colonial context. He analyses Europe’s grand narrative and linguistic imperialism in the next chapters, explaining contributions of William Jones and John Gilchrist. ‘Racism and White Aesthetics’ is the chapter added in the new edition.
While criticising the western colonial powers and presenting some historical facts with an explanation from the point of view of the colonised, Nayyar is unemotional, substantiating his argument with references and original texts both from Urdu and English. Presenting excerpts from works by some colonial writers, such as, Rudyard Kipling and John Gilchrist, Nayyar proves the racism was the most lethal weapon of the colonialists. Orientalists worked on eastern languages and literatures to justify and reinforce colonialism and, proves Nayyar, postcolonialism is a kind of ideological response to the theory and practice of colonialism, thus presenting the postcolonial identity of the colonised.
But the academic circles in the West were — and perhaps still are — generally, and naturally, unaware of the works carried out in Urdu on postcolonial perspective. Dr Omair Ahmed Khan, an educator and scholar of comparative literatures, came to know about some academic work-in-progress at a European university and was dismayed to note that the general perception there was that there was no such thing as a postcolonial study in Urdu. Having read Urdu literature vastly as well as Nayyar’s works, he decided to translate Nayyar’s book into English. So with permissions, Omair Khan began rendering the new edition of Nayyar’s Urdu work, published by Sang-i-Meel Publications in 2024, into English. Sang-i-Meel has just published the English translation, too.
Translation is a tricky business as it demands faithfulness to the original text but also needs a lucidity and accessibility, which is sometimes lost in translation, as idiomatic expressions or peculiarities of a language may cloud the meaning for a reader from a different linguistic and cultural background. Titled Postcolonial Perspectives in Urdu Literature, Omair Khan’s English translation of Nayyar’s Urdu book is a good example of a faithful translation taking care of some semantic issues that translators often confront with. Through this translation, Omair Khan has introduced postcolonial issues discussed in Urdu as well as Urdu criticism’s modern viewpoint to a greater readership since English is not only the preferred medium of the academia worldwide but it has also become the virtual global lingua franca. Translating an essential Urdu work on postcolonialism into English is in fact putting Pakistan and its literary and academic works on world literary map.

The minister assurance came while presiding over a meeting to address the bottlenecks faced by meat exporters in exporting meat to Malaysia.
The meeting was attended by secretary of industries and production, Saif Anjum, along with representatives from both the public and private sectors.
The meeting discussed issues and recommendations related to meat exports to Malaysia. Exp­orters identified main challenges including feed quality, livestock breed, high production costs, lack of cold chain facilities, limited banking support, and documentation hurdles.
Exporters emphasised that the banking sector is not providing adequate support, forcing them to make cash payments in cattle markets. They also highlighted the absence of cold storage facilities at airports, compelling them to store meat in vehicles.
Representative of meat exporters pointed out that while India exports meat at USD 3.5 per kilogramme, Pakistan’s export cost stands at USD 5 per kilogramme. They further said that Pakistan currently exports meat to Taji­kistan at the same rate. The minister acknowledged the concerns raised by exporters and affirmed that Pakistani meat is of superior quality and capable of competing in international markets.

‘Pakistan Country Opinion Survey for Pakistan’
, commissioned by the World Bank.
The survey found that support for climate change initiatives increased from 5 per cent in fiscal year 2021 to 34pc in fiscal year 2025. Similarly, support for water and sanitation rose from 9pc to 35pc in the same period.
While the World Bank Group’s (WBG) work in pandemic preparedness, gender equity, and disaster risk management received the highest effectiveness ratings, the overall perception of its support has decreased significantly since 2021 in other areas, especially for governance, education, and water and sanitation.
In qualitative comments, respondents called for the WBG to deepen its local engagement in Pakistan, “moving beyond federal-level interactions to more meaningful collaboration at the grassroots, provincial, and community levels to better understand local needs and ensure effective implementation”.
Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s support have declined in key sectors
The survey showed that financial resources were considered the WBG’s greatest value to Pakistan at 48pc, followed by knowledge products (33pc), technical assistance (32pc), and capacity development (24pc).
While ratings for many key performance indicators remained largely consistent with 2021 findings, the survey noted that the only rating to show a significant improvement was the perception of the WBG’s effectiveness in achieving development results in Pakistan.
More than half of respondents felt that the WBG has strengthened its work in improving people’s lives (52pc) and in being easy to work with (51pc).
Additionally, just under half believed the Bank has somewhat or significantly improved the technical quality of WBG-supported projects and partnered with others to increase development finance (49 per cent and 48 per cent, respectively).
A government institution respondent stated that “capacity building of the local stakeholders and impact assessment of the projects should be necessary in the project design”.
A parliamentarian suggested the WBG “develop people-to-people contact, and engage civil society along with the government for better results of project implementation.” The parliamentarian added that Parliament and local body members “must be taken in decision and implementation of projects”.
Collaboration with the national government received the highest ratings this year, but this perception has decreased significantly since fiscal year 2021. At the same time, perceptions of effective collaboration with civil society have improved significantly.
However, the group’s collaboration with the parliament and local government received relatively lower ratings, with stakeholders from the office of a parliamentarian giving some of the lowest ratings.
Respondents were most familiar with the WBG’s and the United Nations’ work among development institutions. The survey found the WBG to be one of the most trusted institutions in Pakistan, alongside the UN and the Asian Development Bank.
Significant differences emerged in how various groups perceive the WBG. Respondents from bilateral agencies and government institutions were more positive about WBG staff accessibility than those from the offices of parliamentarians, civil society, and academia. Respondents from local government organisations tended to be more critical of the WBG’s work.
The Country Opinion Surveys, which are part of the World Bank Group’s programme series, explore stakeholder opinions on the economy, future priorities, and perceptions of the WBG’s effectiveness, relevance, and ability to influence the development agenda.

• KP Assembly to convene today after CM meets speaker to discuss ‘political situation’
PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday announced a jirga, to be held in his hometown of Bara in the Khyber district, on Saturday (Oct 25) to establish enduring peace in the restive province and resist decisions made without the input of residents.
In a tweet, the newly elected CM reiterated that no one would be allowed to impose decisions made behind ‘closed doors’. The CM said that the KP residents would decide their future and warned of vetoing any unilateral decisions regarding the restive province. “People of KP will decide about their lives and future,” CM Afridi said in a tweet.
The PTI has consistently opposed plans to conduct anti-terrorism operations across the province, with its incarcerated founder Imran Khan in August telling then-CM Ali Amin Gandapur not to allow the Centre to conduct any military operations. Mr Khan had made a similar demand last month and apparently CM Afridi replaced Mr Gandapur for the same reason. In his maiden speech last week, the CM had said a military offensive was not a solution to militancy.
Against this backdrop, CM Afridi said the provincial government stood by the ideology of Imran Khan and the interests of the KP residents. He said a peace jirga would be held in Bara on Saturday, which would be attended by local elders from Khyber.
When contacted, former cabinet member Mena Khan Afridi said the CM had made it clear that decisions made behind closed doors would not be implemented anymore and that was the reason he wanted to seek public opinion through a jirga.
“Mostly, these are the tribesmen belonging to the merged districts, who have been facing the challenge (of militancy) more than those living in settled districts. He (the CM) himself is a tribesman and wants to put this case before the tribesman,” the lawmaker said. Mr Mena Khan Afridi said that people from Khyber would participate in the jirga, but anyone from any other merged district can participate.
In the past, similar jirgas had been convened by ex-CM Gandapur, who held consultative meetings with public representatives and elders from all merged districts, wherein the participants suggested engaging with the interim Afghan government and holding talks for regional stability.
A similar gathering was organised by PTI’s student and youth wing on September 12, where participants, from across the province, had demanded negotiations with the interim Afghan government for regional peace, involving tribal elders. The participants had called for the immediate withdrawal of all the cases filed against those who raised their voices against terrorism.
“We have made several demands in the declaration. Some issues fall within the domain of the federal government, while some are related to the provincial government. Whoever does it, we want our issues resolved,” Insaf Youth Wing’s regional president Sajjad Mohmand said.
KP Assembly session
Meanwhile, KP Speaker Babar Saleem Swati issued a notification for the assembly session at 2pm today instead of on October 25. A statement issued from Mr Swati’s office read that the decision was taken following a meeting between Mr Afridi and Mr Swati held at the speaker’s house.
“The meeting involved a detailed discussion on the current political situation and parliamentary matters of the province. The chief minister proposed convening an assembly session, and the speaker, after consultation, agreed to summon the session,” the statement read.

• Calls for ‘National Agriculture Restoration Policy’
ISLAMABAD: The PTI’s Kisaan Wing (PTI-KW) has urged the federal and provincial governments to prioritise the restoration of agriculture sector, which suffered large-scale devastation due to the recent floods across the country, calling for the immediate formulation of a ‘National Agriculture Restoration Policy’.
This demand was made through a unanimous resolution passed at the PTI-KW meeting held on Sunday. The meeting was chaired by PTI-KW Organiser and MNA Sheikh Waqqas Akram, and attended by Central Information Secretary Khalid Nawaz Sadhraich, PTI Kisan Wing Punjab President Major (R) Ghulam Sarwar, General Secretary Muhammad Ijaz Shafi, MNA Khurram Shahzad Virk and a number of office bearers from various farmers’ organisations.
Briefing the media after the meeting, PTI-KW spokesperson Khalid Nawaz Sadhraich expressed deep concerns over the authorities’ handling of the post-flood situation. He said the recent floods caused a large-scale destruction across the country, resulting in estimated losses exceeding Rs822 billion. “The federal government’s preliminary flood damage assessment report admitted this loss, but the actual losses could be even higher as a detailed post-disaster assessment is still underway”, he added.
Mr Sadhraich said the meeting expressed dissatisfaction over the government’s post-flood relief and rehabilitation measures, terming them “highly disappointing” for the affected people, particularly farmers. He noted the initial estimates put the losses in agriculture sector alone at around Rs430 billion, excluding livestock and damage to the canal system.
“With the Rabi season fast approaching, helpless farmers have no access to basic inputs for sowing their crops, while they are being offered a mere Rs20,000 to Rs25,000 as compensation against losses worth millions,” he said.
The meeting emphasised the urgent need for rebuilding the destroyed agricultural infrastructure and called on the government to give the matter top priority. It also stressed the immediate formulation of a National Agriculture Restoration Policy and the creation of a committee comprising senior government officials and farmers’ representatives to rebuild the country’s agricultural economy, Mr Sadhraich concluded.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950102/beyond-baku-belem,Beyond Baku & Belem - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE UN climate conference (COP29) in Baku last year was credited with several achievements. It resolved the lingering issue of voluntary carbon credit trading systems between countries for reaching their emission reduction targets as set out in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. It operationalised the Loss and Damage Fund. Importantly, it agreed on a new financial goal for assisting developing countries.
In the two-layered arrangement of the ‘new collective quantified goal’, developed countries pledged to mobilise at least $300 billion annually by 2035. Recognising that the need for climate finance in developing countries far exceeds this amount, the second layer of the goal aims to raise $1.3 trillion by 2035 from all other sources. To chalk out a strategy and develop a step-by-step approach to realise the finance goals, COP29 also agreed on the Baku-to-Belem roadmap.
Mobilising such huge amounts was never going to be easy at a time when climate change continues to outpace climate action by leaps and bounds. In the months since Baku, environmental disasters have grown in ferocity and frequency, impeding long-term economic growth and exacerbating poverty and inequality. Each flood, heatwave, wildfire or drought brings disaster, reverses developmental gains and raises relief and reconstruction costs.
The challenge is compounded by geopolitical problems and conflicts. When countries augment their defence budgets, it often translates into slashing development funds. Climate and environmental agenda get relegated down the priority list. Last month, the UN reported that global military spending reached a record $2.7tr in 2024, the highest annual rise since the Cold War. Going by this trend, spending could climb as high as $6.6tr by 2035.
There are both challenges and opportunities.
Meanwhile, climate finance has struggled to keep pace with the impact of global warming, notwithstanding the pledges at Baku. With the next climate conference, COP30 in Brazil just weeks away, a quick check is in order to see if the world is living by its promises made in Baku.
To their credit, some major multilateral climate financing mechanisms have performed better than in previous years, raising and disbursing substantial amounts. The Green Climate Fund leads with a total portfolio of $66bn including co-financing. It has committed $18bn to projects mostly in the least developing countries of Asia and Africa.
The Adaptation Fund’s $2.01bn and the Global Environment Facility’s $24.33bn are part of the pool. The Loss and Damage Fund, still in its infancy, has received pledges amounting to $0.79bn. To complement, the World Bank raised its contribution to $31bn last year for financing that had climate co-benefits, up from $29.4bn for the previous financial year.
Regional development banks also chipped in with impressive shares. ADB committed $12.3bn in climate finance in 2024. Sixty per cent, or $7.4bn, was earmarked for climate change mitigation and the remaining $4.9bn for adaptation. In Africa, the continent with the lowest emissions of GHG, the African Development Bank seeks to mobilise $4bn this year for projects under its Climate Action Window. The second Africa Climate Summit in Addis Ababa last month, agreed to set up the Africa Climate Innovation Compact and the African Climate Facility to mobilise $50bn annually in climate finance.
However, the amounts mobilised or committed thus far are no way near the assessed needs for climate finance. UNEP’s Adaptation Gap Report 2024 puts the annual funding gap for adaptation between $187bn and $359bn.
Governments and multilateral development banks will need the private sector to fill this gap and put in place a strong financial scaffolding for climate change. The banking sect­­or, a key pla­y­­er in this field, faced a setback this mon­th when the Net-Zero Ban-king Allia­­nce paused operations, though banks will still be able to use its resources to set decarbonisation targets. The private sector’s full potential can only be catalysed by creating an enabling environment that fosters green investments, reduces risks and promotes accountability.
To navigate such difficult financial straits, the onus will be on governments to implement their new Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs 3.0 in a manner that frontload investments into climate change and find innovative ways of financing from other sources. Optimising nature-based solutions is a way to do more with less.
The journey from Baku to Belem and beyond is strewn with challenges but there are also opportunities, which must not be missed because climate action cannot be paused. Re-energising regional initiatives for climate and environment will surely help in making this journey less arduous.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950104/now-the-hard-part,"Now, the hard part - Newspaper - DAWN.COM","HECTIC diplomacy and decisive intervention by President Donald Trump produced a
ceasefire
in Gaza after two years of a brutal Israeli military offensive that left over 67,000 Palestinians dead, a humanitarian catastrophe and total devastation. Dramatic developments that culminated in the US president’s visit to the Middle East and the ‘peace summit’ in Sharm el-Sheikh aroused hopes of an ‘era of peace’. But that may be a distant possibility given the fragility of the ceasefire and the stumbling blocks facing the critical next phases of the peace process.
The peace declaration
signed
by Trump and leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye at Sharm el-Sheikh contains general principles. It states the commitment to implement the Trump peace agreement but without detailing or elaborating its various elements. The signing ceremony neither had a representative from Hamas nor Israel, the two parties to the ceasefire agreement. The ceasefire, in any case, marks the beginning of a process not its culmination.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proclaimed victory after Hamas
released
all the Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. But his commitment to honour the ceasefire and implement other steps of Trump’s 20-point plan, especially withdrawal from Gaza, is yet to be tested. His record is not encouraging. The last ceasefire in
January
was unilaterally ended by Israel after two months when it
restarted
its military onslaught. Tel Aviv also refused to negotiate further phases of what was earlier agreed.
This time Hamas sought written guarantees that Israel would not resume fighting once hostages were released. But it was unable to secure this. Instead, it got verbal assurances from the Americans. It will need Trump’s sustained engagement and pressure on Netanyahu to keep the peace process on track. Trump has staked his prestige on the Gaza deal,
casting
it as a “historic dawn of a new Middle East”. But he is not known to involve himself in detail that the plan’s implementation will require in the weeks ahead. Trump’s attention span is famously short.
With a fragile ceasefire in place, the path to peace in Gaza is strewn with formidable obstacles.
The next phase will involve intense negotiations to reach agreement on key aspects of the Trump plan, including demilitarisation of the territory, dismantling Hamas, pullout of Israeli forces from Gaza and deployment of a multinational stabilisation force. These are all vexing issues on which there is a yawning gap between the positions of Hamas and Israel. On Gaza’s post-conflict governance, convergence has yet to be evolved between the Palestinians/ Arab governments and Washington. The US has baulked at addressing the all-important issue of Palestinian statehood, for which Muslim countries want some assurance beyond the vague reference in Trump’s plan to “a pathway” to statehood.
Hamas is expected to disarm under the plan but has given no unequivocal assurance to give up arms as there is no commitment from Israel to withdraw from Gaza. Hamas leaders have indicated that without a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the territory they will not lay down their arms. A senior Hamas leader, Mousa Abu Marzouk, has said his organisation would only hand over weapons “if the occupation ends and Palestinians can govern themselves”. Others have said they want an iron-clad assurance about the establishment of a Palestinian state.
Trump’s 20-point plan does not address how to sequence Gaza’s demilitarisation with an Israeli pullout. It does not specify a timetable to achieve these two evidently linked goals. This will have to be negotiated which will not be easy, especially as Netanyahu has not committed to a full withdrawal from Gaza. With Israeli officials already claiming Hamas is tightening control over areas that their forces initially vacated, Netanyahu can indefinitely delay the drawdown. Tel Aviv can even derail the process, citing lack of movement on disbanding Hamas.
There are also many unanswered questions about the ‘temporary stabilisation force’ envisioned for Gaza to secure the Strip. The US has already sent 200 troops to Israel to be deployed as part of the so-called civil-military coordination centre to help the stabilisation force monitor the ceasefire and oversee the peace. The terms and rules of engagement of the international stabilisation force (ISF) are purposely absent in the plan and will need to be thrashed out. Negotiations are said to be underway on this.
Will this force have a UN mandate authorised by a Security Council resolution? Several Arab states have shown preference for that. Western members of the P5 are said to be working on a resolution to establish a stabilisation force but not one that operates under the UN flag. Any expectation for its role to involve counter-insurgency or disarm Hamas would be hard for potential troop-contributing countries to accept. No Muslim/ Arab state would want to be seen as acting against Palestinians on Israel’s behalf or protecting Israel. ISF’s size, composition, who will lead it, precise role and how long it is deployed all have to be figured out in negotiations.
Its deployment has to be closely synchronised with the post-conflict governing arrangement in Gaza. Under the plan, a ‘Board of Peace’ headed by Trump is to supervise the temporary transitional governance by a committee of Palestinian technocrats and international experts who are to be responsible for day-to-day affairs. Again, who will constitute this committee and how legitimate will it be, are questions that still have to be grappled with. This international trusteeship arrangement, until a reformed Palestinian Authority takes over, will basically mean Gaza is run by outsiders for an unspecified period in a colonial-style enterprise. How viable this will be — and acceptable to the Palestinians — is an open question. Authority after all depends on legitimacy.
The challenges ahead are daunting. There are already signs of brewing trouble that can unravel the peace plan. Israel has
continued
to shell Gaza and kill Palestinians during the tenuous ceasefire and delayed full access for humanitarian aid. Hamas has handed over a list of Israeli violations to mediators. Israel has threatened to resume fighting if Hamas doesn’t comply with the deal. Echoing Israel’s threat, Trump has said he would allow Israel to restart military action if the organisation does not lay down its arms. All this suggests that the path to what Trump envisions as a “new dawn” in the Middle East remains a long and uncertain one.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950108/need-for-safeguards,Need for safeguards - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"ONE of the key manifestations of extremism in Pakistan is the misuse of blasphemy laws. While sacrilege can never be condoned, it is the misuse of these laws to settle personal scores and persecute vulnerable groups that has led to frequent bouts of violence in society.
In this regard, the government has
stated its intent to reform the laws
in order to prevent abuse. While speaking at an event at the Supreme Court recently, the federal law minister said that “procedural safeguards” were being introduced in blasphemy-related cases to prevent misuse. At the same event, the chief justice of Pakistan highlighted the need for interfaith harmony.
While specifics are not available, any progress in this regard should be welcomed, though it must be remembered that previous efforts at reform — even those led by the higher judiciary — have stalled due to the pushback from extremist lobbies.
Calls for reform of the blasphemy laws, and legal safeguards, are by no means a defence of sacrilege. For harmony in society, no abuse against the revered figures and scriptures of all faiths can be tolerated, and there can be no room for hate speech. Instead, what activists have been saying for decades is that the misuse of the laws has to be prevented. We have seen far too many incidents where personal disputes have led to accusations of blasphemy, while in other instances, sacrilege allegations have been used to dispossess minorities of their land.
Moreover, recently a gang of criminals was uncovered that would trap people online and blackmail them, threatening to go public with false blasphemy allegations against the victims unless they paid up.
Clearly, steps need to be taken, as innocent people have lost their lives simply on the basis of unproven claims and spurious ‘evidence’. Even the head of the Council of Islamic Ideology
said
last year that certain “religious elements” were misusing the laws and resorting to “mob justice”, which is “un-Islamic”.
If the state’s latest attempt to reform the said laws is to succeed, then there needs to be buy-in from mainstream clerics. Unless clergymen of all sects endorse the state’s move, and extremist voices are isolated, the initiative is unlikely to succeed. But beyond legal changes, to end the troubling culture of false blasphemy allegations, there needs to be grassroots change in society, so that sensitive religious issues are not used to target people.
Countering violent extremism has been highlighted both in NAP and NAP 2.0, yet beyond solemn promises, successive administrations have done little on the ground to translate these aims into policy. Holding conferences and issuing statements is not enough. Conversations must be held in neighbourhood mosques, madressahs, schools and bazaars to communicate the message, and adopt a ‘whole-of-society’ approach against extremism.

told
him India will stop buying Russian oil, while warning that New Delhi would continue paying “massive” tariffs if it did not do so.
“I spoke with Prime Minister Modi of India, and he said he’s not going to be doing the Russian oil thing,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.
Asked about India’s assertion that it was
not aware
of any conversation between Modi and Trump, Trump replied: “But if they want to say that, then they’ll just continue to pay massive tariffs, and they don’t want to do that.”
Russian oil has been one of the main irritants for Trump in prolonged trade talks with India — half of his
50 per cent tariffs
on Indian goods are in retaliation for those purchases.
The US government has said that petroleum revenue
funds
Russia’s war in Ukraine.
India has become the
biggest buyer
of seaborne Russian oil sold at a discount after Western nations shunned purchases and imposed sanctions on Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Trump on Wednesday said Modi had assured him that day that India would stop its Russian oil purchases.
India’s foreign ministry said it was not aware of any telephone conversation between the leaders that day, but said that New Delhi’s main
concern
was to “safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer.”
A White House official said on Thursday that India has halved its purchases of Russian oil, but Indian sources said no immediate reduction had been seen.
The sources said Indian refiners already placed orders for November loading, including some slated for December arrival, so any cut may start showing up in December or January import numbers.

On this occasion the parent company unveiled its full capabilities in smart mobility, hybrid powertrains, engines and solid-state battery technology, demonstrating a deep integration of technology with the user experience.
As a long-term technology leader the parent company of OMODA & JAECOO has continuously pushed the boundaries of core powertrain technologies: it has broken through global battery safety limits, mastered solid-state battery technology and set industry benchmarks; it has ventured boldly into innovation no-man’s-land, achieving an engine thermal efficiency of 48 per cent — while mainstream engines typically range from 38pc to 45pc. Each 1pc increase in efficiency involves immense systemic challenges. The R&D team overcame these technical hurdles with multiple disruptive innovations including a 26:1 ultra-high expansion ratio, hyperbolic triple-linkage mechanisms, a 35pc EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) rate and thermal-insulation coatings, thereby remaining at the forefront of engine technology.
This breakthrough is not only a technical achievement but also reshapes the value proposition of hybrid vehicles: data show that for every 1pc increase in thermal efficiency, overall vehicle fuel consumption can drop by approximately 2.5pc. In future hybrid vehicles are expected to enter the “1-litre fuel-consumption era”, approaching the energy cost of pure electric vehicles and delivering long-term economic and practical value to users. Meanwhile the launch of AIMOGA (Moja Robot), the intelligent service platform, was unveiled at the event, showcasing the brand’s practical application of AI and human-machine interaction, making technology truly serve users’ lives.
The core technology highlights of OMODA & JAECOO hybrid vehicles were also comprehensively presented during the summit, demonstrating the brand’s leadership in power and energy efficiency. Equipped with the world-leading SHS Super Hybrid System, the three core components work in deep synergy to achieve super performance, super range, ultra-low energy consumption and super power. The fifth-generation 1.5 TDGI hybrid-dedicated engine incorporates a deep Miller cycle, i-HEC intelligent combustion system and six other advanced technologies, achieving a thermal efficiency of 44.5pc and fuel consumption as low as 5.99 L/100 km, thus balancing powerful performance with ultimate efficiency.
The hybrid-dedicated infinitely variable super-electric DHT intelligently switches driving modes according to vehicle speed, precisely matching power and fuel requirements under different conditions. The high-performance hybrid battery pack features comprehensive protection including heat resistance, impact resistance, waterproofing and 2-millisecond post-collision power-cut protection, supporting a 90km pure electric range and 3.3kW external power output, thereby ensuring safety, endurance and outdoor power applications. During this long-distance test, OMODA & JAECOO hybrid vehicles handled all road conditions easily, ensuring stress-free long journeys.
International Technology Night was not just a technology showcase but also a stage for global users and partners to witness co-creation achievements. During the event Vietnamese user and content creator Bach Thanh Trung shared his real-life driving experience in
My Daily Life with the JAECOO J7 SHS
. He spoke sincerely about how the J7 SHS integrates into his daily routine: quiet electric mode for weekdays, hybrid power for weekend adventures; the vehicle also provides convenient mobile power support for camping and outdoor work. His words conveyed JAECOO’s core spirit; versatile, free and agile,  meeting daily mobility needs while enabling users to explore life’s possibilities.
In addition to user-experience sharing, International Technology Night gathered global media and partners to witness the brand’s technology and user co-creation achievements. During the awards ceremony Kuwaiti KOL Mohammad Alkandari and Turkish senior journalist Hirant Kasapoglu received the Global Eco Co-Creation Excellence Award, alongside other international partners, demonstrating the diversity and global influence of the OMODA & JAECOO ecosystem. Applause and cheers throughout the venue highlighted the brand’s steady steps in promoting user co-creation and smart mobility worldwide.
The success of International Technology Night not only showcased OMODA & JAECOO and its parent company’s comprehensive strength in smart mobility and core powertrain technologies but also reaffirmed the brand’s commitment to co-creating a better life with users. In future OMODA & JAECOO will continue integrating technology and ecosystem resources with a global vision, enabling more users to experience intelligent, free and diversified mobility, and jointly shaping a green, smart and sustainable future of transportation.

Afridi had
filed
the plea on Oct 17, two days after he was sworn in as the provincial chief executive on Oct 15. He had gone to Adiala jail — where Imran has been
imprisoned since September 2023
— after
getting protective bail
from the Peshawar High Court on Oct 16. However, he was denied the
meeting
; Afridi has stated that he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran. He had then filed a plea with the IHC, however, the registrar’s office had
objected
to the maintainability of the plea.
Today, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir took up the matter and overruled the objections of the registrar office.
Afridi’s lawyer Advocate Ali Bukhari said that the registrar’s office had raised the objection that the petition was filed “without the provincial cabinet and government’s decision”.
“This objection has no standing as the cabinet has not been constituted as yet,” he contended.
Subsequently, the court removed the objections and issued notices to the interior secretary, the Punjab Home Department secretary, the Punjab inspector general of prisons and the Adiala jail superintendent for Oct 23.
The petition filed by Afridi had contended that the KP government had earlier submitted formal requests to the federal interior ministry and the Punjab home department to allow a meeting with Imran, but no approval was granted.
The plea maintained that consultation with the PTI founder was “legally and ethically necessary” for the chief minister in connection with key administrative and political decisions, including cabinet formation.
Meanwhile, in its objections the IHC registrar’s office had noted that the court had already adjudicated similar matters and had laid down a procedure for seeking permission to meet the PTI founder. The office questioned how a new petition could be filed without following the prescribed process.
Correction: This story previously incorrectly stated that the Islamabad High Court had issued a notice to the Punjab inspector general of police. However, the notice has been issued to the Punjab inspector general of prisons. The error is regretted.",2025-10-20,Tahir Naseer,592,0.000104
https://www.dawn.com/news/1950173/pakistan-afghanistan-peace-hinges-on-taliban-halting-incursions-defence-minister-asif,Pakistan-Afghanistan peace hinges on Taliban halting incursions: Defence Minister Asif - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that the
ceasefire agreement
between Islamabad and Kabul was linked to the Afghan Taliban’s ability to rein in terrorists attacking Pakistan from neighbouring soil.
The two countries agreed to a ceasefire in Doha at the weekend after days of
border clashes
that killed dozens, the worst such violence since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021. Ground fighting between the one-time allies and Pakistani airstrikes across their contested 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control terrorists it says operate from safe havens in Afghanistan.
“Anything coming from Afghanistan will be [a] violation of this agreement,” Asif said in his office at Parliament in Islamabad. “Everything hinges on this one clause.”
The Taliban administration and Afghanistan’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“In the agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkiye and Qatar, it was clearly spelled out that there would not be any incursions,” the minister said.
“We have a ceasefire agreement as long as there is no violation of the agreement which is already in force.”
The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militant group operated out of Afghanistan to attack Pakistan “in connivance” with the Taliban, the defence minister said.
Kabul has previously denied such accusations.
In a separate interview to
Al-Jazeera Arabic
, he said the primary objective of the ceasefire agreement was to “eliminate the menace of terrorism”.
Asif added that terrorism has been affecting the Pak-Afghan border areas for years.
He elaborated that both countries concluded that the immediate eradication of terrorism was essential. The two sides, he added, would make serious efforts to curb terrorism; otherwise, regional peace could face grave threats.
Asif said the agreement was primarily reached through the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye, adding that both countries’ presence served as a guarantee for the accord.
The defence minister also appreciated the
role played
by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in facilitating the agreement.
Asif maintained that another meeting would be held next week in Istanbul to finalise the details of the agreement, and an effective mechanism would also be devised to resolve the existing issues between the two countries.
He further said that his Afghan counterpart had also acknowledged terrorism as the main cause of tension in bilateral relations, which would now be addressed.
The defence czar stated that Pakistan has suffered immense human and financial losses over the past years due to terrorism. However, he expressed hope that peace would now return and relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan would normalise.
As a result, he said, Pakistan-Afghanistan trade and transit activities would resume, enabling the latter to use the former’s ports once again.
Asif also added that Afghan refugees holding valid visas and documents would be allowed to stay in Pakistan. However, a large number of undocumented refugees would continue to be repatriated, he added.
The minister said it was premature to claim satisfaction over the resolution of all concerns. “We will have to see in the coming weeks and months how effectively the agreement is implemented,” he said.
In a separate
interview
to
Arab News
, he ruled out the notion that Pakistan had conducted the airstrikes in Kabul on the urging of the United States, saying: “It is total nonsense and nothing else.”
He questioned why Pakistan would do so, saying the country had had enough of its involvement in Afghanistan for the past few decades.
“We want to stay away and live like decent neighbours. We don’t want to have any involvement in Afghan affairs,” Asif said, adding that Pakistan had “no business” in Afghanistan’s relationship with India or any other country.
“Absolutely not. Whatever they want to do in their own territory and doesn’t spill over to our territory, doesn’t become our business.”
Doha talks and press release controversy
Speaking later in an interview on
Geo News
show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Asif said the Doha talks were not held in a bitter atmosphere and credited the Qatari and Turkish officials for it.
“Not even an opportunity for confrontation was provided on any conflicting point,” he said, adding that all talk of amendments and additions or deletions was done through the Qatari and Turkish officials.
“Direct interaction only happened at the opening, where both sides talked … but all of the engagement was done through Qatar and Turkiye.”
Asif added the draft agreement was only one page, contrary to a longer version he said was circulating on social media. He added that an upcoming meeting in Turkiye would further refine the details, such as the mechanism to implement the deal’s aspects.
Questioned about his own thoughts about whether the ceasefire would hold, the defence minister said: “I have guarded optimism on the matter; I am hopeful but also remain cautious. Can only say something conclusively given the circumstantial evidence. It is too early at the moment, we must remain hopeful of course.”
The minister added that he hoped that the Afghan Taliban would act as a “unified government” and conclude the matter with Pakistan instead of returning tomorrow and saying that separate factions were behind the tensions.
He elaborated that in the case of any violation, Qatar and Turkiye would be asked to play their role. Asif added that the mechanism for this entire process would be decided in the meeting on the October 25.
The defence minister also stated that the entire TTP leadership was present in Afghanistan, adding that the matter would be taken up in Istanbul as well. He further said that the talks should not be taken to mean that Pakistan would negotiate or hold talks with the TTP, dismissing such a notion.
Questioned about changes in Qatar’s press releases on the ceasefire with “tensions on the border” removed in a subsequent statement, Asif acknowledged that there was debate on wherever the word was used, but ultimately Qatar’s press release had nothing to do with the draft of the agreement, adding that he could not divulge its contents.
“It is between them. It has absolutely no effect on the agreement,” he said, adding that the incident had no particular implications as were being derived by others.",2025-10-20,APP,1609,0.000181

rose to fame
as ‘chaiwala’, was restored by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) after verification.
Khan, who hails from Mardan, rose to fame back in 2016 when a photographer shared a photo of him pouring tea on Instagram, which went viral. He
approached
the LHC in April against the blocking of his identity documents by Nadra and the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports.
An order issued today by LHC Justice Justice Jawad Hassan noted that the petitioner informed the court his grievance was redressed.
“Learned counsel for the petitioner … submits that after this court had taken cognizance of the matter, the competent authority called the petitioner to appear before the verification board constituted at the concerned office of Nadra and after due verification, his CNIC has been unblocked, thereby redressing his grievance,” the order noted.
It added that Khan’s counsel said the petitioner did not want to proceed with the main writ petition since his CNIC was unblocked by Nadra, also confirmed by the law officer after obtaining instructions from the concerned quarters.
The judge subsequently dismissed the main petition, noting it had “borne fruit”.
Speaking
to the media after the hearing, Barrister Umer Ijaz Gilani said the issue was taken up at the government’s “highest level”, after which the verification process was initiated by Nadra, with the result being that the CNIC was determined to be wrongfully blocked.
Khan himself said he was a Pakistani and would always remain one.
Khan, who used to work at Islamabad’s Sunday Bazaar on Peshawar Chowk, had become popular overnight. Within no time, countless people had begun visiting his shop just to take selfies with him and soon, a modeling agency also entered into a deal with him and shot a few commercials to make good use of the craze.",2025-10-20,Tahir Naseer,498,9.7e-05

captain
, the country’s cricket board announced on Monday.
The national side’s pace spearhead will lead Pakistan in the upcoming three-match series against South Africa.
Shaheen replaces Mohammad Rizwan as the Pakistan ODI skipper after the wicket-keeper led the team during a disastrous ICC Champions Trophy campaign before series losses in New Zealand and the West Indies.
Rizwan, handed captaincy in 2024, had led the team to series wins in South Africa, Australia and Zimbabwe in his early days as captain, however. But the recent failures apparently were a decisive enough factor for the Pakistan Cricket Board to sack Rizwan.
For Shaheen, it’s going to be a second stint as the Pakistan captain, the left-armer having been snubbed after a short spell — five T20Is against New Zealand — at the helm after replacing Babar Azam in late 2023 following Pakistan’s dismal World Cup campaign.
The 25-year-old, who has been captaining Pakistan Super League side Lahore Qalandars for the last few years, seems to be Pakistan white-ball head coach Mike Hesson’s pick as the team’s leader going into the build-up for the 2027 World Cup.
“Shaheen’s appointment for the upcoming series was finalised today following a meeting held in Islamabad, which was attended by white-ball head coach Mike Hesson, Director High Performance Aqib Javed and members of the selection committee,” a short press release by the PCB said.
Shaheen has represented Pakistan in 66 ODIs and 92 T20Is, taking a combined 249 wickets. In 32 Tests, excluding the ongoing second Test against South Africa at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, Shaheen has claimed 120 wickets.
The PCB regime, led by Mohsin Naqvi since February 2024, has chopped and changed captains repeatedly. It first removed Shaheen as captain to bring back Babar Azam as white-ball skipper in the first half of 2024.
Later, Babar, owing to the team’s poor performance in the T20 World Cup, decided to step down, after which Mohammad Rizwan was given the reins of the white-ball team.",2025-10-20,Dawn.com,529,0.0001

According to Sarfraz, the father of the alleged victim, Hira (16), a resident of Mari village in Sargodha district, his daughter was employed as a maid at the house of Dr Umar Meikan, who also belongs to the same village, but resides in Lahore.
He alleged that Dr Meikan and his wife would not allow him to meet his daughter.
Sarfraz further said that on the intervention of some village elders, Dr Meikan finally allowed him and his wife to see their daughter.
He alleged that when they reached Dr Meikan’s house in Lahore, they found Hira in a miserable condition with her head shaved. He said the girl told them that Dr Meikan, with the help of his wife, allegedly shaved her head.
Sarfarz said, quoting his daughter, that the couple would also subject Hira to torture by giving her electric shocks. He also alleged that the employers would starve the girl and force her to stay awake all night.
The victim also alleged while talking to the media that the couple would not pay her salary as they adjust the amount against the cost of some utensils which got broken.
Sarfarz alleged that Dr Meikan had threaten to implicate him in a “fabricated” theft case if he reported the matter to police.
He said that they had earlier reported the matter to the Jhal Chakian police on Oct 18, but they were told that because the alleged atrocities were committed in Lahore, the case would be registered there.
However, when the video clip of the girl surfaced on social media, the police registered a case against the couple on the night of Oct 19 under sections 337-V and 354/34 of the Pakistan Penal Code and arrested Dr Meikan.
On the other hand, the arrested suspect says that the girl was employed at his sister’s house and allegedly committed thefts. Dr Meikan says that earlier Sarfarz had admitted his daughter’s “crime”, but after her video clip went viral on social media, he demanded Rs1 million for not implicating him and his wife in a “false” case.
Sources say that the police are also looking for Dr Meikan’s wife, who is also nominated in the FIR.

“A narrative is being built that I will go for confrontation with the federal government. Yes, I will, if anything is done by it against the Constitution. I will continue to speak for the supremacy of the Constitution,” he told a provincial assembly session chaired by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati here.
The chief minister said that he wrote letters to the chief justice of Pakistan and federal and provincial governments and even
petitioned
the Islamabad High Court for ensuring his meeting with detained founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Imran Khan but to no avail.
He said he would challenge the federal government over the continued denial of his meeting with Imran and would boycott meetings called by it.
Informs assembly that there won’t be any political arrests under MPO in province
Mr Afridi said that after exhausting all legal options for the purpose, he would place his case
before the people
to devise the future course of action.
He said that the law and order situation was worsening as the decisions were taken behind closed doors.
“Our [PTI’s] stand is that policies for KP should be made by the province’s government and its residents only,” he said, vowing to resist any decisions taken behind closed doors.
The chief minister said his government
welcomed
peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban in Doha but had reservations about it as elders and public representatives from KP should be part of the dialogue as advocated by the PTI founder.
He announced that no political worker would be arrested under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order in the province, while the police won’t register FIR against any student leader.
Mr Afridi also announced the establishment of police stations for women across the province.
He said that the meeting called by the prime minister was about Afghan refugees and food security and not the law and order situation, so he sent the chief secretary as the province’s representative besides Muzammil Asalam who was aware of the situation in KP.
“Our stand on Afghan refugees is clear. Those, who have lived here for over 40 years, should be sent back in a dignified way. Those stationed on the border should not create issues about the
repatriation
of Afghan refugees,” he said.
The chief minister said that the police and the counter-terrorism department were leading the fight against terrorists from the front.
“The vehicles gifted by the federal government to our police force have become outdated, so we have decided to return them,” he said.
Earlier, Leader of the Opposition in the assembly Dr Ibadullah said working for peace in the province was the top priority of every MPA. He urged the chair to call a meeting of the house’s peace committee.
Dr Ibadullah said that the opposition would never allow any action that went against the interest of the province.
“The opposition will stand with the government in case of any positive step taken in the interest of the province,” he said.
The opposition leader vowed to highlight the government’s weak performances.
He insisted that the opposition never opposed Mr Afridi’s meeting with Mr Imran.
Mr Swati observed that the first meeting of the house’s peace committee would be held soon after the finalisation of its terms of references, with all relevant government officers being asked to show up.
Treasury lawmaker Adnan Qadri said Mr Afridi’s victory in the chief minister’s election was the victory of the people and the defeat of all “other powers.”
He said people from tribal districts thanked the PTI founder for nominating Mr Afridi from among them as the province’s chief executive.
”Those who held news conferences against the new chief minister disheartened the tribesmen,” he said.
Mr Qadri also condemned the alleged killing of TLP workers during street protests in Punjab and demanded their names be made public.
MPA Dr Amjad Ali said if the Pakistan Army could take over 34 posts on Pak-Afghan border, why they didn’t eliminate 500 terrorists from Bajaur district in the last three months. He said Pakistan wanted talks with India after border clashes but never held negotiations with Pakhtuns.
The MPA said he, as the minister for mines and minerals, was denied access to mines in merged tribal districts by security forces citing the delicate law and order situation as the reason.
“The Katlang area where a
drone strike
was carried out, has vast pink topaz reserves. Pink topaz is found in Brazil or Katlang only,” he said.
Mohammad Nisar of the opposition ANP said for the first time, he felt the house was serious about discussing the issues of merged tribal districts.
He said terrorists were identified in some villages but even then, 13 civilians, including women, children and elderly, were martyred with no body of the terrorists found.
“We are not aliens. We want an end to the buffer zone. We want developmental funds to be spent in our merged areas,” he said.
The lawmaker said efforts were under way for the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, to get control of
KP’s mines and minerals
and declare the merged districts federal territory,” he said. The speaker congratulated Hindu community’s members on diwali, the festival of lights.
The house also passed a resolution by a majority vote, urging the provincial government to inform the United Nations that the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa do not accept Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the nation’s representatives nor does they recognise Israel.
The resolution was tabled by Abdul Salam Afridi, whose another resolution seeking medical facilities for Imran and his wife in jail, was also adopted.
The chair later adjourned the sitting until 2 pm today (Tuesday).

filed
by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi for a meeting with PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail, while separate anti-terrorism courts issued non-bailable arrest warrants for several PTI leaders, including Imran Khan’s sister,
Aleema Khan
.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir of the IHC heard the petition, with Advocate Ali Bukhari appearing on behalf of the KP chief minister. The plea, filed through Advocate General Shah Faisal, sought the court’s direction to the jail authorities to allow a meeting between the PTI founder and the provincial chief executive to discuss matters concerning governance and the formation of the new cabinet.
Earlier, the registrar’s office had raised
objections
, noting that similar petitions had been decided earlier and that a prescribed procedure existed for seeking such meetings. However, Advocate Bukhari argued that the petition carried “fresh legal grounds”, as the provincial cabinet had yet to be formed and consultation with the PTI founder was necessary for administrative decision-making.
After hearing arguments, Justice Arbab Tahir dismissed the objections and issued notices to the Secretary Home, Inspector General of Police, and Superintendent Adiala Jail, directing them to submit responses by October 23. The petition maintained that despite prior requests made to the federal interior ministry and Punjab home department, no permission had been granted for the meeting, which the KP government described as “legally and ethically necessary” for governance.

Arrest warrants
Meanwhile, in Rawalpindi, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah once again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, in connection with the November 26, 2024, protests. The warrant was reissued due to her continued absence from proceedings in a case registered at the Sadiqabad Police Station.
The court directed Superintendent of Police (Rawal Division) Muhammad Saad to arrest and produce Aleema Khan before the court on Oct 22. It also ordered the confiscation of her surety bond and the verification of property documents submitted by her guarantor.
Ms Khan, along with her sister Uzma Khan and several PTI supporters, had previously been arrested during demonstrations at D-Chowk last year but was later
released
on bail.
In a separate development, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra in Islamabad issued non-bailable arrest warrants for PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Zain Qureshi, Zartaj Gul and Advocate Ali Bukhari in cases related to alleged unrest and violations of law during a PTI rally held at Sangjani.
During the hearing, the ATC directed the concerned police authorities to arrest the accused and produce them before the court on October 23.

• CM Bugti terms killing ‘deeply tragic,’ vows terrorism won’t derail democracy; Maulana Hidayatur Rehman opposes in-camera briefing
• Waleed Saleh Baloch laid to rest in Panjgur amid large gathering of mourners and political leaders
QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Monday unanimously adopted a condemnation resolution against the
killing
of Waleed Saleh Baloch, brother of National Party leader and member of the provincial assembly (MPA) Mir Rahmat Saleh Baloch.
Speaker retired Captain Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, who presided over the session, also ruled that an in-camera session on the province’s
deteriorating
law and order situation would be convened soon and the exact date would be announced within a day or two.
At the request of Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, the speaker adjourned the House after the adoption of the joint resolution.
Moving the resolution, National Party President Dr. Abdul Malik Baloch expressed grief and sorrow over the tragic incident and demanded the immediate arrest of those involved in the killing.
He said that Waleed Baloch was murdered in Panjgur during a wedding ceremony, adding that the law and order situation in the province had worsened to the point where people no longer felt safe travelling on highways.
‘Deeply tragic’
CM Bugti called for a special in-camera briefing in the assembly on the province’s security situation. “The killing of Waleed Baloch is deeply tragic. Terrorism, by whatever name it occurs, is terrorism and must be condemned,” he said. Mr Bugti added that the adjournment of assembly proceedings reflected collective grief and sent a clear message to terrorists that they could not derail the democratic process. “We will not retreat even an inch from democracy,” he asserted.
He further said that despite past terrorist attacks on educational institutions, schools and universities were now active again. “The Baloch are being pushed into an unwinnable conflict through terrorism, but we stand with our security forces in this war,” the chief minister stated.
Leader of the Opposition Mir Younas Aziz Zehri said, “The terrorists have martyred Waleed Baloch and plunged the entire province into mourning. If they think such actions can deter us from our mission, they are mistaken. We may live or die, but this province and country will remain.”
In-camera briefing opposed
MPA Maulana Hidayatur Rehman Baloch criticised the assembly for offering repeated condemnations without action, saying it had “become a place for condolences”. He alleged that armed groups were openly extorting money in his constituency while security personnel focused on minor issues instead of combating terrorism.
He opposed another in-camera briefing, saying, “Let’s discuss the issue openly instead of holding a speech contest under the name of an in-camera session.”
Earlier, Waleed Saleh Baloch was laid to rest on Sunday at his ancestral graveyard in Panjgur.
He was gunned down by unidentified assailants near his residence in Chitkan, a locality on the outskirts of Panjgur city.
A large number of people, including leaders of various political parties, Dr. Abdul Malik Baloch, Senator Jan Buledi, MNA Pullain Baloch, Deputy Commissioner Abdul Kabir Zarkoon, District Police Officer Dost Muhammad Bugti, central and provincial leaders of the National Party, tribal elders, and citizens attended the funeral.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950281/8-militants-gunned-down-in-dera-ismail-khan,8 militants gunned down in Dera Ismail Khan - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least eight alleged terrorists were gunned down by security forces in an operation on Monday, after a team from Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) came under attack near the Kot Lalu area in Daraban, Dera Ismail Khan.
The action came in an apparent response to an attack on the SNGPL team, in which security forces reportedly also suffered casualties. However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) or other security agencies about their losses until going to press.
Sources said the militants were killed after intelligence reports were received about their presence in a nearby jungle, prompting the security forces to launch an offensive in which eight suspects were gunned down.
Following the action, the forces cordoned off the area and initiated wide-ranging search-and-clearance operations in the surrounding terrain. Reinforcements were dispatched to secure the site and to pursue the fleeing suspects.
Two suspects killed in Swabi encounter; attack on Bannu police station repulsed
Officials told reporters that the slain militants allegedly were members of a cell that had been planning a direct attack on the pipeline project. They said the group intended to sabotage the installation — a project of national importance aimed at providing energy, employment and improved services to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Investigations were ongoing and local authorities said they would share further details as the clearance operation and forensic work proceeded.
Two killed in Swabi
Separately, two militants were killed in a joint operation conducted by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Mardan and the Swabi district police before midnight, Ziauddin Ahmad, the district police officer, said on Monday. The incident took place three days after a hand grenade was hurled at the Kalabat police post by unidentified men, in which a constable was martyred.
According to a separate press release, the CTD and Swabi police were engaged in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in mountainous Maini village when four alleged militants riding two motorcycles opened fire on the law enforcers.
“The CTD operation party retaliated with full vigour. As a result, terrorists were killed on the spot, and their two accomplices escaped, taking advantage of darkness,” said DPO Ahmad.
Soon after the incident, a search and strike operation was launched in the area. The slain men allegedly belonged to the TTP Tayyip Akbar Group and were wanted in numerous cases, including attacks on the police.
Attack repelled
Separately, an attack targeting the police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu district late Sunday night was thwarted by the police. A police official said that a group of militants attacked the police station with advanced light and heavy weapons in a bid to breach the building.
“But the personnel deployed there were fully alert as they had noticed the terrorists’ movements with the help of thermal vision cameras,” he said, adding that the law enforcers countered the attack vigorously and forced the assailants to flee.
The official said that after hearing about the attack on the police station, local residents armed with weapons also came out of their houses and assisted police in their action against terrorists. He said that all policemen remain safe in the attack.
Meanwhile, two policemen who had been kidnapped from the Peepal Bazaar in Bannu on Monday were freed by their captors. A police official said that two police officials, including Naheedullah and Eid Muhammad, were kidnapped by unknown armed men when they were returning to their duty place after performing their duty with the polio teams.

“Hopefully, permission will be granted soon,” he said, adding that the government is working on meeting international standards and enhancing safety protocols, which could lead to expanded global routes.
A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) spokesman highlighted the significance of US routes for PIA, emphasising the strong demand for non-stop flights from Pakistanis living in North America.

According to an aviation expert, a team from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had recently visited Pakistan to conduct a safety audit.
A positive outcome from these audits could result in PIA achieving Category 1 status from the FAA, which is crucial for the resumption of direct flights to the US.
PIA codeshare with Etihad
Meanwhile, PIA announced on Monday it has entered into a codeshare agreement with UAE’s Etihad Airways.
The partnership, set to take effect from Oct 31, will extend to cargo services and frequent flyer programmes.
“This agreement marks a milestone for PIA,” a spokesperson said, adding that it will encompass passenger flights as well. The arrangement will primarily benefit routes not directly serviced by PIA, allowing passengers access to Etihad’s expansive network.
The codeshare is expected to enhance PIA’s service offerings and contribute to increased revenue, the spokesperson noted.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Sar­dar Moh­ammad Sarfraz Dogar and Jus­­tice Khadim Hussain Soo­mro will take up the bar’s plea on Wed­nesday (tomorrow).
The petition was filed by IBA President Chau­dhry Naeem Gujjar.
The Islamabad District Bar Association has approached the court, contending that it is the principal stakeholder in matters relating to the independence of the judiciary and the supremacy of the Consti­tu­tion.
The application argued that fair and transparent adjudication of the pending writ petition would be impossible without hearing the bar as a party, since the issues involved are of “fundamental importance” to the legal fraternity and the rule of law.
The association emphasised that under its Memorandum of Association (2016), it is mandated to safeguard the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, and civil liberties. It further maintained that the bar has historically been at the forefront of struggles for constitutional supremacy and must therefore be heard in this matter.
The plea recalled that the bar’s functions include facilitating its members in the performance of their professional duties, protecting their interests, and maintaining high standards of integrity and ethical conduct.
“The Islamabad Bar is resolute in shielding the superior judiciary from attacks, whether internal or external, and in striving for the supremacy of the Constitution,” the application stated.

The groundbreaking ruling has strengthened protections for wor­k­ing women across the country.
The order came in response to a complaint filed by Ms. Zainab Zahrah Awan, who was terminated in April 2024 while on duly sanctioned maternity leave.
The Ombudsperson ruled that such termination not only viola­tes the Protection against Har­as­sment of Women at the Workplace

FOSPAH directed that Rs800,000 be paid to the complainant as compensation and Rs200,000 deposited into the national treasury, declaring the termination letter null and void and restoring the complainant’s employment status.
In her detailed judgement, the Om­­budsperson emphasised that maternity protections are non-negotiable and inviolable
rights
, reinforced by Pakistan’s commitments under international instruments such as CEDAW, ICESCR, and ILO conventions.
“Safe motherhood is not a favour — it is a fundamental right,” the order stated, adding, “No woman should be forced to choose between her career and motherhood.”
The Ombudsperson reaffirmed that all employers must uphold women’s dignity and equality at the workplace.
The decision sets a significant precedent for women’s workplace rights in Pakistan, underscoring that any termination during maternity leave is unlawful and amounts to gender-based discrimination.

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif on Monday revealed that the government was forming a
National Commission for Minorities
(NCM) to safeguard their rights.
“Parliament has given its approval and work is in progress on proposed National Commission for Minorities and the government has rolled out targeted support programmes from scholarships for minority students at primary through tertiary levels to representation of minorities in federal and provincial assemblies,” the PM said at a ceremony held at the PM House on Diwali.
He
extended
Diwali greetings to the Hindu community and other religious minorities, calling the festival a “beautiful message of joy, peace and tolerance” and reaffirming the government’s commitment to protecting minority rights.
Addressing the event, which was attended by religious and diplomatic figures, members of minority communities and parliamentary representatives, the prime minister said the presence of Hindu, Christian and other minority leaders at the event reflected “the living reality of Pakistan’s pluralism”.
He reiterated that every citizen regardless of faith has the constitutional right to practise religious rituals without fear or intimidation. He urged Muslims and non-Muslims to work “shoulder to shoulder” to resist hatred, intolerance and extremism and to preserve Pakistan as a land of tolerance and peaceful coexistence.
Minister of State for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kheal Das Ko­­histani, on the occasion, paid tribute to the prime minister for organising Diw­ali celebrations officially at the PM House, making a unique historic moment.
Industrial production

Later, presiding over a separate meeting on small and medium enterprises (
SMEs
), PM Shehbaz directed the authorities concerned to encourage the registration of cottage SMEs to enable them avail business loans and pave the way for country’s industrial growth.
The prime minister appreciated the initiatives to enhance women’s participation in SMEs and called for awareness on such measures. He emphasised setting up a clear timeline for the implementation of Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority’s (Smeda) roadmap and its early execution.
The prime minister said the country’s industrial growth was linked with the development of cottage SMEs and cited the developed countries where they provide raw material to large industries. The premier directed to conduct the training for SMEs in rural areas for processing of agricultural commodities.
He expressed satisfaction with the industries and production ministry’s efforts for Smeda’s restructuring and SME development.
During the briefing on Smeda’s restr­u­cturing and initiatives, it was informed that offices had been established in Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan for SME development, which was welcomed by the public and chambers of commerce.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950299,Doha truce - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"AFTER over a week of hostilities during which some of the fiercest exchanges took place between Pakistan and Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, a fragile calm between the two countries has been established.
A long-term
ceasefire
was reached in Doha early on Sunday, where both sides pledged to continue the diplomatic process and find a permanent solution to the prevailing problem — cross-border incursions by Afghanistan-based terrorist groups. Qatar and Turkiye have played a key role in bringing about the truce, and representatives of both Islamabad and Kabul will meet in Istanbul on Saturday to take the process forward.
Though the Pakistani state and the Afghan Taliban once maintained cordial relations, matters have nosedived during the hard-line group’s second innings. At the heart of the matter is the sanctuary provided by the Afghan Taliban to the banned TTP and other militant groups that have staged bloody attacks in Pakistan. Though the Taliban deny this, there is overwhelming evidence that suggests that terrorist groups indeed have havens in Afghanistan.
Over the last few months, the attacks have
increased
significantly — over 600 attacks over the past year, according to one
report
— causing heavy casualties amongst Pakistani security men. It is because earlier attempts at dialogue failed to stop such attacks that the state took action, hitting militant targets across the border.
But while this may have sent a strong message to Kabul, if the hostilities continue, it will bode ill for peace in South Asia, as Pakistan will have to face adversaries on two hostile borders. Therefore, the state may have to combine deterrence through military means — in case of further attacks — with sustained diplomacy through common friends and regional allies to arrive at a long-term solution.
After the Doha parleys, the Taliban spokesman said there would be no “hostile actions” against Pakistan. While such promises have been made during earlier diplomatic encounters as well, for example earlier this year under Chinese auspices, it is hoped this time the Kabul regime is serious about stopping cross-border militant activity.
As Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar noted, a “verifiable monitoring mechanism” is needed to implement the broad details agreed to in Doha, which should be the goal during the next meeting in Turkiye. Though the Taliban may remain in denial, the international community agrees that they continue to host terrorist groups. Therefore, as the de facto government in Afghanistan, it is their duty to prevent these outfits from harming neighbouring states.
While some militant groups — the TTP, Al Qaeda — may respond to the Taliban ‘requests’, others, such as IS-K, are unlikely to oblige. However, it is the Taliban’s job as the governing entity in Afghanistan to ensure the security of regional states is not harmed by groups based on its soil.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950303,Too many battlefronts - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"IT has been some years since Anatol Lieven
called
Pakistan a ‘hard country’, a phrase which didn’t really get much traction. It just didn’t carry enough negative connotations; the rest of the world preferred sobriquets such as ‘failed state’ or ‘the most dangerous country in the world’. It left most of us who live in Pakistan with the sense that we had a tendency to attract attention for all the wrong reasons. And whatever our image, it wasn’t going to be one highlighting our softer attributes.
Now, it seems, we ourselves are trying to create a tough brand. Of being known as hard, a powerful state which no one can ride roughshod over, be it enemies within Pakistan or external.
These are not mere words. Just over the recent week, a protest originating from Lahore was
not allowed to make its way to Islamabad
, a destination which has been overrun by many others in the past. This was followed by a
crackdown
on the TLP, which had announced the protest, combined with allegations of state violence leading to loss of life. And while, the TLP itself has been guilty of violence on more than one occasion, the pattern of the state’s reaction has now become familiar. In the past couple of years, there have been protests in different parts of the country where political parties such as the PTI as well as citizen rights movements such as the PTM or BYC have all alleged loss of life. Religio-political organisations such as the TLP were treated a bit differently but not anymore. Those who convey the master’s message claim that the party will now be disbanded.
Around the same time, Islamabad’s relations with Kabul are also at an all-time low. It seems as if the time for playing nice is over and if the terrorist attacks in Pakistan continue, Islamabad will inflict pain on Afghanistan to change its big, bad ways. If earlier the pain was inflicted through
refugee repatriation
or border controls, now there will be more — the
targeting of terrorists
based there and skirmishes on the border. Over the weekend, these tensions led to our Gulf brethren entering the fray to
soothe the two neighbours
. What a turnaround; once seen as the patrons of the Afghan Taliban, Pakistan now needs intermediaries to make nice with them.
Picking so many battles leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time.
And these battles are being fought at a time when there are reports aplenty of another aggression from India. Be it official or unofficial voices, or even some from across the border, there are warnings enough of unfinished business on the eastern border. And what if this happens at a time when the western border is also tense? Especially as it’s not just the borders which can pose a threat? The tensions with both the neighbours are closely linked to the deteriorating security situation in two provinces — Balochistan and KP. Pakistan’s view is that the eastern and western neighbours are encouraging infiltration of terrorists and providing them with the finances. And so serious is this external factor that the debate over how the discontent in these provinces has been feeding into the violence has been abandoned.
In the tough posturing with aggressive neighbours and militant groups, there is confidence that Punjab and Sindh are under control. At this time and age, the absence of a mass people’s movement and violence means all is well. And if in one province, the water issue has led to simmering anger and in the other the government’s legitimacy is under question, these are smaller problems, for repression or concessions (as in Sindh on the water issue and in Azad Kashmir) can lead to a sense of quiet.
So much so that the state felt confident in cracking down on the TLP. Success has been declared, for there was no pushback and the street remained quiet. And there is so much applause that few are brave enough to ask what this will mean for the PML-N, whose members may have to face a backlash in their constituencies, as they did in 2018. This security threat will be an additional burden for them.
But overall, between the crackdowns on the people, parties, rights movements, militants and angry neighbours, it is difficult not to wonder whether the tough posturing or the effort at shaping a hard state may also be one that is overstretched. At odds with forces within as well as enemies without, what if the burden proves too much?
This is not to say it can’t win all these battles. Perhaps it can, though it is worth cautioning against excessive confidence. But there is another downside. Picking so many battles, especially with genuine grassroots movements or mainstream political parties, leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time.
Indeed, it is so busy fearing and controlling the people in general that it has no space and goodwill left to push through any reform which is politically hard. If an election has been managed in order to impose unpopular leaders, who is going to push the traders to pay taxes? It is easier to keep them happy and burden others. If a right-wing organisation has to be brought down, who will plan to improve the education sector and take on the wrath of the teachers who may take to the streets? One can only imagine decisions that have been postponed because Imran Khan and Ali Wazir have to be kept behind bars.
The list can go on and on. There is a price to be paid for this tough posturing. And what it really cost the hapless people of Pakistan will continue to be calculated for long after this period is over. For the moment, we can only guess what the eventual burden might be.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950303/too-many-battlefronts,Too many battlefronts - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"IT has been some years since Anatol Lieven
called
Pakistan a ‘hard country’, a phrase which didn’t really get much traction. It just didn’t carry enough negative connotations; the rest of the world preferred sobriquets such as ‘failed state’ or ‘the most dangerous country in the world’. It left most of us who live in Pakistan with the sense that we had a tendency to attract attention for all the wrong reasons. And whatever our image, it wasn’t going to be one highlighting our softer attributes.
Now, it seems, we ourselves are trying to create a tough brand. Of being known as hard, a powerful state which no one can ride roughshod over, be it enemies within Pakistan or external.
These are not mere words. Just over the recent week, a protest originating from Lahore was
not allowed to make its way to Islamabad
, a destination which has been overrun by many others in the past. This was followed by a
crackdown
on the TLP, which had announced the protest, combined with allegations of state violence leading to loss of life. And while, the TLP itself has been guilty of violence on more than one occasion, the pattern of the state’s reaction has now become familiar. In the past couple of years, there have been protests in different parts of the country where political parties such as the PTI as well as citizen rights movements such as the PTM or BYC have all alleged loss of life. Religio-political organisations such as the TLP were treated a bit differently but not anymore. Those who convey the master’s message claim that the party will now be disbanded.
Around the same time, Islamabad’s relations with Kabul are also at an all-time low. It seems as if the time for playing nice is over and if the terrorist attacks in Pakistan continue, Islamabad will inflict pain on Afghanistan to change its big, bad ways. If earlier the pain was inflicted through
refugee repatriation
or border controls, now there will be more — the
targeting of terrorists
based there and skirmishes on the border. Over the weekend, these tensions led to our Gulf brethren entering the fray to
soothe the two neighbours
. What a turnaround; once seen as the patrons of the Afghan Taliban, Pakistan now needs intermediaries to make nice with them.
Picking so many battles leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time.
And these battles are being fought at a time when there are reports aplenty of another aggression from India. Be it official or unofficial voices, or even some from across the border, there are warnings enough of unfinished business on the eastern border. And what if this happens at a time when the western border is also tense? Especially as it’s not just the borders which can pose a threat? The tensions with both the neighbours are closely linked to the deteriorating security situation in two provinces — Balochistan and KP. Pakistan’s view is that the eastern and western neighbours are encouraging infiltration of terrorists and providing them with the finances. And so serious is this external factor that the debate over how the discontent in these provinces has been feeding into the violence has been abandoned.
In the tough posturing with aggressive neighbours and militant groups, there is confidence that Punjab and Sindh are under control. At this time and age, the absence of a mass people’s movement and violence means all is well. And if in one province, the water issue has led to simmering anger and in the other the government’s legitimacy is under question, these are smaller problems, for repression or concessions (as in Sindh on the water issue and in Azad Kashmir) can lead to a sense of quiet.

IQAir
.
In past few years, air pollution has become one of the most pressing public health and environmental crises facing Pakistan. Various
cities
of the country, most notably
Lahore
, deal with smog especially in the winter months. The phenomenon is attributed mainly to industrial emissions,
vehicular pollution
,
stubble burning
and
air movement
.
Ranked the world’s third most polluted city yesterday,
Lahore
rose to the second spot today with an air quality index (AQI) reading of 234 at 11am, categorised as “very unhealthy”. The provincial capital trailed just behind New Delhi, which had an “hazardous” AQI of 489.
Karachi
recorded an AQI of 182 at 11am, falling in the “unhealthy” range and just barely behind Kuwait’s capital at 183. India’s Mumbai came in at fifth with an AQI of 169.

By 4pm, the AQI for Lahore had dropped to 154, placing it sixth on the list, while Karachi was still the third-most polluted city with an AQI of 165.
IQAir’s AQI is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). An AQI between 151 and 200 is considered “unhealthy”, one ranging from 201 to 300 is categorised “very unhealthy”, and any figure above 301 is “hazardous”.
According to IQAir, the AQI readings for Lahore and Karachi were the highest recorded so far this month.

At 11am in Lahore, concentration of the pollutant PM2.5 — cancer-causing microparticles small enough to enter the bloodstream — was measured at 158.8 microgrammes per cubic metre of air (μg/m³), 31.8 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) guidelines.
PM2.5 level in Karachi was recorded 100 µg/m³, 20 times the WHO’s annual guideline value.
IQAir advised residents in Lahore and Karachi to avoid outdoor exercise, run air purifiers and prioritise wearing masks. It also recommended closing all windows to avoid dirty air from outdoors.
Smog is
set to intensify
across Lahore and other parts of Punjab due to a combination of local emissions and pollutants carried by low-speed winds from India, following Diwali celebrations, according to the provincial government.
In a bid to combat smog, the Punjab government started water sprinkling operations from Sunday night and activated
anti-smog guns
in the most affected areas.
In Lahore, these measures were deployed across the city, including Karim Block, Allama Iqbal Town, Multan Road, Ravi Bridge, Shahdara Flyover, GT Road, Thokar Niaz Baig, and Upper Mall.
Besides local pollutants, winds blowing from India are also likely to play a role in worsening the situation over the week.
Separately, the Lahore police said yesterday it
arrested 83
people and registered 77 cases as part of its ongoing anti-smog operation.
Air pollution poses a hazardous risk to people’s health, with respiratory issues
witnessing a spike
during winter when smog intensifies. According to WHO Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo,

Senior Civil Judge Mubashir Hassan Chishti presided over the proceedings and directed that Gandapur — who did not show up today — be arrested and presented before the court.
The hearing was adjourned till October 28.
The case dates back to October 30, 2016, when Islamabad police
said they had recovered
five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol and three tear gas shells from then-KP revenue minister Gandapur’s car outside Bani Gala, where the residence of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan is located.
The incident had taken place against the backdrop of authorities preventing PTI supporters from reaching Bani Gala on Imran’s call to execute a plan to ‘lockdown’ the capital later on November 2.
Gandapur had
rejected
police claims, saying that two of the five assault rifles found on him were licensed while the others were official weapons provided to his security guards. He had also claimed that the teargas launcher and bottles of liquor were not his and that he had been carrying honey in the liquor bottle.
Subsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the capital’s Bhara Kahu police station.
Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times since over his non-appearance, including on

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
A statement from the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at Islamabad’s NIH said the latest case of poliovirus was detected in a 12-month-old boy from Ghari union council in Torghar, marking the second case in the district this year.
“With this detection, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 30 – including 19 from KP, nine from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” it said.
The statement added that during the month of September, the Pakistan Polio Programme collected 127 sewage samples across 87 districts in the country.
Of these, 81 samples tested negative for poliovirus, while 44 were found positive; two samples are currently under process in the laboratory, it added.
Balochistan reported 21 negative sample and two positive; Punjab reported 22 negative, 8 positive and one which was still under process; KP reported 24 negative and 10 positive; Sindh reported seven negative, 21 positive and one which was under process; Islamabad reported four negative and one positive; Azad Jammu and Kashmir reported three negative; and Gilgit-Baltistan reported one negative and one positive.
“While the overall trend indicates a decline in positive detections, reflecting the impact of recent high-quality vaccination campaigns, virus circulation persists in certain high-risk areas. These detections highlight the continued need for strong, targeted efforts to interrupt transmission,” the statement said.
It added that the Polio Eradication Initiative was intensifying efforts to sustain comprehensive vaccination coverage and ensure the “highest quality campaigns in vulnerable” areas.
The statement said that the fourth national polio vaccination campaign for 2025 was conducted last week, vaccinating over 44 million children, while the campaign in south KP was currently in
progress
.
In 2024, the country
reported
at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.",2025-10-21,Rukhsana Khan,670,0.00011

The matter gained traction as the proposed name is already the name of an opposition alliance led by Mehmood Khan Achakzai. The applicants, who also sought the allocation of a joint election symbol, included Pakistan Aman Tehreek Chairman Ali Sher Yousafzai, Pakistan Falahi Tehreek Chairman Fazal Aman Khan, and Pakistan Welfare Party Chairman Muhammad Farooq.
The TTAP — which saw the move as an attempt to take away its title and sabotage its resistance movement — had formed a legal team to defend its position before the ECP, with Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar appearing before the commission today.
The matter was heard by a three-member ECP bench headed by the member from Balochistan, Shah Mohammad Jatoi.
During the hearing, the Pakistan Falahi Tehreek chairman told the ECP that the parties had not applied for the registration of the alliance.
“We were informed that we had filed an application through a notice issued by the election commission,” he said.
At this, the ECP member from Punjab, Babar Hassan Bharwana, remarked, “We did not issue a notice ourselves; someone must have applied.”
He also called for a forensic analysis of the application, saying, “You should consult your legal adviser and apologise if you have applied by mistake.”
The ECP told the three parties to withdraw the application, warning that action would be taken against them otherwise.
For his part, Khokhar filed a request seeking the provision of records. Khokhar said that an opposition alliance had been formed under Achakzai’s leadership called the TTAP. He urged the ECP to not entertain the plea.
The ECP then sought detailed statements from the three applicants and said it would issue and appropriate order. Later, the applicants submitted handwritten requests seeking the withdrawal of their application.
Veteran politician Achakzai, who also heads his own Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), was made chairman of the TTAP, weeks after the February 8
general elections
. The PTI, PkMAP and Balochistan National Party-Mengal are among the major parties of the alliance.
The alliance alleges that the mandate of PTI was stolen and it does not acknowledge the present government as a genuine representative of the voters. The opposition alliance recently put on hold its countrywide public meetings and protests, mainly, in the wake of floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.
‘Space for opposition getting narrower’
Speaking to the media outside the ECP, Khokhar termed the application a “childish thought”.
“Space for the opposition in this country is growing narrower and narrower,” Khokhar said, decrying the move to steal the TTAP’s name.
Speaking about the opposition alliance, he said, “This has been underway for a long time … the largest opposition party, PTI is a part of it; the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen is also a part of it; Balochistan National Party’s Akhtar Mengal is also a part of it; other parties and civil society individuals are also a part of it.”
He also went on to say that such requests should not be entertained. “If we want to run this country in a better way, in an acceptable way where the rule of law governs, then we should refrain from these kind of requests,” he said.
“The three parties that came today — we didn’t even know who they were — they submitted their withdrawal application. But for the future … we are also clever, and we will not back off in the face of such efforts. We will continue to defend and promote our right to political opposition,” he said.",2025-10-21,Irfan Sadozai,945,0.000131
https://www.dawn.com/news/1950373/3-civilians-killed-in-muridke-operation-claims-punjab-minister,"3 civilians killed in Muridke operation, claims Punjab minister - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari claimed on Tuesday that three civilians were killed during the operation in
Muridke
that dispersed
Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan
(TLP) protesters.
The TLP, which began a protest march in
Lahore
earlier this month, was planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. The march and sit-in, which reached
Muridke
, quickly turned into violent clashes between protesters and police before the protesters were dispersed, leading to a
crackdown
on the party and its supporters.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore today, the Punjab information minister said “false stories” were being perpetuated about the operation in Muridke.
“Three civilians were martyred in Muridke. These were people who were passing by or standing off to the side,” she said, adding that 48 civilians and 110 police officers were also injured. Eighteen out of 110 have sustained firearm injuries, she said.
The minister also said that police vans had been stolen and eight were set on fire. Referring to “exclusive” footage of the clashes that was aired at the press conference, she said, “They brought trolleys full of bricks … and the sad thing is, they did all of this in the name of religion, Palestine, and Gaza.”
She also displayed footage of valuable items recovered from the residence of the party’s leader, saying, “1.920 kilograms of gold; 898g of silver; 69 branded watches, 28 gold bracelets … in the name of charity, they bring it back home,” she said.
She urged children “who love their faith” not to be taken in by groups that use it for political or financial gain, and requested parents to not send their children to be involved in such activities.
“Don’t be used in the political agendas of others,” she said. “Stories on social media are scripted.”
“We are not moving or transferring anyone’s grave or shrine,” she said, adding, “But to use that grave to collect charity, to gather people and provoke violence — the Punjab government won’t allow that.”
Bokhari said that all the accounts of those who financed terrorist groups were frozen and that those who financed them, or supported them on social media, would be prosecuted and charged with terrorism.
“No mosque is being demolished; what Muslim can even think of that?” she said, adding that the mosques and seminaries would be turned over to “righteous religious groups”.
The provincial information minister stressed that the government was “not against any sect”, but rather against “that mindset that makes people resort to violence”.
She further said that the government had now taken over 330 mosques that were under the TLP.
“We are not against any group, but this is for the country,” she said. “The loudspeakers will be used only for
azaan
and the mosques only for prayers.”
She also said that 223 seminaries of the TLP had been geotagged and details of them obtained, adding that they would soon be reopened and that most had already reopened.
“Six madressahs were built on government property, that had no records,” the minister pointed out, “and no one had the right to question it, because then a
fatwa-i-qatal
would have been announced.”
She said that those who had taken the law into their own hands and were responsible for the injuries and deaths of civilians and police would be prosecuted under anti-terror laws.
“Both the brothers are being traced; they have not been shot or arrested,” she said, referring to Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas. “They have fled, and we will arrest them soon.”
Bokhari also said that the decision to ban the TLP is expected in the next few days.
The minister added that the time was “now or never” for Pakistan to decide if it wanted to be a democratic and progressive Islamic country.
“The government has decided, now it is on the people.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950374/smog-theatre-will-cannons-and-towers-clear-polluted-air,‘Smog theatre’: Will cannons and towers clear polluted air? - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"As Lahore gears up for another smog season, an imposing new fleet of green trucks is making rounds across the city. Branded as “Anti-Smog Guns”, they spray a fine mist into the air in hopes of settling pollution.
Launched under the banner of
Climate Resilient Punjab
, the fog cannons promise cleaner skies.
They look like action. Do they deliver?
The science says no. A 2023
study
from China tracked air along a road segment before and after a mist cannon passed. PM2.5 rose by up to 13 per cent about 25–35 minutes later, as the extra water accelerated chemistry that formed more fine particles. In other words, the cannon didn’t clean the air. It primed the air to make more pollution.
In Lahore, each
fog cannon
costs over Rs45 million, according to news reports. The machines were imported from China and formally handed over to the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a high-profile event attended by senior government leadership.
Running one unit continuously can consume up to 360,000 litres of water per day. Multiplied across 15 units (and possibly more to come), this represents a massive environmental and financial burden, especially in a water-stressed, smog-choked city.
The question then becomes: why invest in a solution that does not address the root causes of smog?
Lahore’s pollution comes from the familiar mix: exhaust from vehicles, industrial combustion, brick kilns, construction dust, open waste burning and seasonal crop fires.
Addressing these requires s
tronger regulation
, cleaner fuels, public transit investments and regional coordination with the agricultural sector. Not atmospheric firefighting.
Yet smog cannons persist because they look like action. Their towering presence and dramatic spray offer visual reassurance, especially when political pressure mounts.
They are, in effect, optics over outcomes. A show of effort rather than a solution. They are, effectively, ‘smog theatre’.
Smog towers were last year’s spectacle. Installed with fanfare, they failed to dent Lahore’s ambient particulate matter, just as evaluations from experts warned they would. Different machine, same theatre.
Pakistan deserves better. Lahore deserves better. We need evidence-based air quality policy, not spectacles. The resources spent on fog cannons and smog towers would be far more effective if redirected toward emission controls, the release of real-time air quality data, cleaner fuels and public communication about air pollution risks.
The air doesn’t just need to look clean — it needs to be clean.
The true crisis runs much deeper. In 2024, Lahore had zero clean air days under World Health Organisation (WHO) standards.
Its annual average PM2.5 concentration was 104.6 microgrammes per cubic meter, more than three times the Punjab NEQS legal limit and 21 times the WHO guideline.
This level of exposure reduces average life expectancy by seven years. This is not a seasonal phenomenon. It is a systemic failure with multiple sources.
China’s success offers a better model. As Ma Jun writes in
The Economics of Air Pollution in China
, authorities began by developing detailed emissions inventories, conducting cost-benefit analyses and targeting specific polluting sectors with enforceable regulation.
This data-driven approach helped Beijing significantly reduce smog within a decade.
Pakistan can do the same.
But only if we stop misting the symptoms and start making policy around the causes.
We need rigorous enforcement of diesel vehicle standards, identification of key emitters through real-world emissions testing, industrial emission controls, brick kiln modernisation and investment in clean public transit.
Until we confront the sources of pollution head-on, no amount of mist will clear the air.",2025-10-21,Abid Omar,939,0.00013

A notification issued by the commission today said the assembly’s tenure was to expire on November 24 and it was the commission’s constitutional duty to organise and conduct general elections and local government elections in GB, along with making all necessary arrangements to ensure that they were conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law, while safeguarding the process from corrupt practices.
“The general public has expressed genuine concerns about appointments, upgradations, and transfers of government officers and officials across various departments during this sensitive pre-election period. These actions have given rise to apprehensions that they may be politically motivated, potentially weakening public trust in the fairness and integrity of the election process.”
“After careful consideration of these concerns, the GB Election Commission believes that such appointments, upgradations, and posting/transfers carried out during the election period risk being viewed as attempts to gain political advantage. This perception could weaken public trust in the neutrality, impartiality, and overall integrity of the electoral process,” the election commission added.
“The commission has also observed growing public concern, regarding the diversion of development funds from approved projects to politically motivated schemes, which clearly constitutes another form of pre-poll influence and has the potential to distort the level playing field among candidates,” the notification said.
It added that it became necessary for the commission to exercise its lawful powers to maintain neutrality and fairness in governance affairs in order to uphold public confidence in the electoral process, to ensure equal opportunity for all candidates, to protect the sanctity and impartiality of the forthcoming general elections, and to prevent abuse of state resources for electoral advantage.
The GB chief election commissioner (CEC) thus ordered that all forms of recruitment or appointment in any regional department, organisation or institution were banned with immediate effect except recruitments made through the Federal Public Service Commission and cases where tests/interviews were already completed by today or where recruitment was urgently needed in the public interest.
The GB CEC further ordered that no new development scheme, community-based initiative or announcement-based project should be awarded, processed or initiated in any form until the next elections were held and a new government assumed office.
Furthermore, any diversion of funds already allocated to development projects in GB was strictly prohibited, with all diverted funds to remain frozen with immediate effect.
“No transfer or posting of government officers/officials shall be made except in cases of genuine public interest, and only after obtaining prior approval/NOC (no-objection certificate) from the GB Election Commission upon submission of a formal proposal.
“No government functionary or elected representative shall announce or inaugurate any new development scheme or project during the election period.
“All development funds relating to local government institutions in GB shall stand frozen with immediate effect until the official announcement of election results. However, in exceptional cases involving extreme urgency or matters of overriding public importance, utilisation of such funds may be permitted strictly upon obtaining prior approval/NOC from the GB Election Commission,” the notification further ordered.
It directed that funds allocated to ongoing schemes should continue to be utilised strictly in accordance with the approved Planning Manual and  Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules without any alteration or modification.
The notification further stated that no creation, alteration or announcement of new administrative units, sub-divisions or similar territorial entities should be made. during the election period under any circumstances.
Listing off more directions, the commission further ordered: “No proposal for the creation of new posts shall be submitted to the GB Finance Department. Likewise, no case of re-designation, up-gradation, concurrence or conveyance of new creation shall be processed by the GB Finance Department or the Services & General Administration Department. However, genuine cases duly justified may be considered only upon obtaining prior approval/NOC from the GB Election Commission.”
“Release of additional funds for new maintenance works is prohibited except in cases of extreme emergency in the public interest, duly justified to and only after obtaining NOC/approval from the GB Election Commission.”
“No new policy, directive, rule or regulation shall be issued or implemented after the issuance of this notification until the formation of the next provincial government.”

boiled over into
outright fighting
, along with
charged statements
from India’s civil-military leadership.
The military’s top brass had warned India earlier this month that any “imaginary new normal” its leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”.
A press release issued from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said the army chief interacted with participants of the 17th National Workshop Balochistan at the General Headquarters.
“The COAS reiterated that while Pakistan seeks regional peace and stability, any violation of its territorial integrity, direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response to safeguard the lives and well-being of its citizens,” the ISPR said.
The military’s media wing added that the army chief underscored that “Indian sponsored proxies”
Fitna al-Hindustan
and
Fitna al-Khawarij
propagated “anti-people and anti-development agendas with malicious intent to perpetrate violence”.
He reaffirmed that all necessary actions were being taken to pursue them and rid Balochistan of their menace.
Fitna al-Khawarij
is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as
Fitna al-Hindu­stan
— a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
“The COAS, during his interaction with the participants, remarked that Balochistan is the pride of Pakistan, endowed with highly vibrant, resilient and patriotic people who are its true wealth. He also highlighted the federal and provincial governments’ development initiatives, being undertaken to uplift the socio-economic landscape of Balochistan through a people-centric approach. He emphasised upon realisation of the immense economic potential of the province for the benefit of the people of Balochistan.”
“Acknowledging the constructive role of civil society, particularly in engaging and empowering the youth, the COAS underscored their pivotal role in sustainable development, negating vested political agendas in the interest of long-term prosperity in Balochistan,” the ISPR added.
On Saturday, the army chief had
cautioned
India that there was “no space for war in a nuclearised environment” as he hailed Pakistan’s “clear victory” during the May conflict with the neighbouring country.
He had also urged the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence and called on the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”.
“Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he had asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an
attack
in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “
Operation Bunyanum Marsoos

increased human-animal conflict
to poaching and environmental degradation, has accelerated the decline of Pakistan’s bear population over the past decade, according to local wildlife experts.
Although no comprehensive scientific surveys have been conducted to determine the exact numbers of bears in the country, experts estimate a 20-30 per cent decline in their population over the past 10 years.
Muhammad Kabir, head of the Wildlife Ecology Lab at the University of Haripur, said that while a few regions in Pakistan still have healthy bear populations, the overall trend remains worrying.
“So much so, bears have become locally extinct from several areas, where they once were believed to have been in ‘good numbers’,” Kabir told
Anadolu
.
Pakistan is home to two species of bears — the Himalayan brown bear and the Asiatic black bear.
The black bear is further divided into two subspecies — the Himalayan black bear (U. t. laniger), found in the temperate forests of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the Balochistan black bear (U. t. gedrosianus), which inhabits the arid montane regions of Balochistan, particularly around Khuzdar and Kalat districts and adjoining areas along the Iran border.
“Bears have been facing multiple threats, which has put them in the list of highly vulnerable species in Pakistan,” Kabir said.
He cited habitat loss, deforestation, expanding infrastructure, agricultural encroachment and illegal poaching as the leading causes of decline. Human-wildlife conflict, he added, is further exacerbating the situation.
Faizan Ahmad, a researcher at the Pakistan Forest Institute, Peshawar, said the Asiatic black bear — once widespread across Asia’s forests — was now under severe pressure in the country.
“Its population is shrinking, fragmented and increasingly drawn into human-modified landscapes where resource scarcity, habitat degradation, and human–wildlife conflict intersect,” Ahmad told
Anadolu
.
He added that as human settlements expand and forest ecosystems become more fragmented, bears are often forced into conflict-prone areas, threatening both conservation efforts and rural livelihoods.
Local extinction
There are no official nationwide population surveys for bears in Pakistan, but indirect indicators such as habitat degradation, increased human-bear conflict and poaching reports point to a steady decline.
Based on recent field data, Ahmad said it was reasonable to estimate a 20-30pc population decline in Asiatic black bears over the past decade.
Currently, around 150-200 Himalayan brown bears survive in small, isolated populations across northern Pakistan. The most stable population is found in GB’s Deosai Plateau, where conservation efforts have led to population growth in recent years.
Deosai National Park remains the only protected area in Pakistan where a regular census is conducted to monitor bear numbers. A smaller population also exists in Khunjerab National Park near the border with China.
The forested districts of Swat, Kohistan, Upper Dir and Shangla in KP; AJK’s Neelum Valley and GB’s Diamer district host the Himalayan black bear.
According to Kabir, the combined population of Himalayan and Balochistan black bears ranges between 1,000 and 1,500 individuals.
“Black bear has vanished from several parts of KP, particularly Ayubia region over the past three to four decades,” he said.
Ahmad added that national estimates suggest fewer than 2,500 bears remain across Pakistan, with the Balochistan black bear population likely reduced to fewer than 50 mature individuals.
“This subspecies is now critically endangered in Pakistan and among the least studied large carnivores in the country,” he maintained.
Medicinal value
Despite legal protection, bear cubs are
still poached
, particularly in early spring when dens are more accessible.
“Local accounts describe poachers lighting fires at den entrances to force mothers and cubs out; the mother is killed, and cubs are sold for bear dancing or bear-baiting,” Ahmad said, referring to the cruel practice where bears are chained and forced to fight dogs for public entertainment.
In addition to illegal trade, bears are hunted in autumn for their pelts and fat. Kabir explained that bear bile (Xiongdan in Chinese) — the dried gallbladder of the Asiatic black bear — has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for thousands of years.
He said it is believed to treat ailments such as liver disorders, fever, digestive problems and inflammation. Bear bile contains ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a compound also used in modern medicine to treat certain liver diseases and dissolve gallstones.
However, the extraction of bile and gallbladders is highly controversial due to its cruelty and devastating impact on wild populations. Conservationists and animal welfare groups have long called for synthetic or plant-based alternatives to bear bile products.
Ahmad emphasised that conservation measures must include habitat protection and restoration, conflict mitigation, den protection, community engagement and long-term monitoring.
“Community-based conflict mitigation strategies, such as compensation schemes, use of non-lethal deterrents and crop protection measures are essential to shift from conflict to coexistence,” he said.
He added that engaging local communities in conservation not only safeguards camera traps and monitoring infrastructure but also encourages local stewardship of wildlife resources.
Ecological threat
Azan Karam, a Swat-based wildlife expert, warned that Pakistan’s declining bear population poses a serious ecological threat because bears play a crucial role as both keystone and umbrella species.
“Its presence supports essential ecosystem functions such as seed dispersal, carcass scavenging and insect regulation, all of which contribute to forest regeneration, nutrient cycling, and overall ecosystem health,” Karam told
Anadolu
.
He said a reduction in bear numbers could disrupt these natural processes, leading to long-term ecological imbalance.
“Moreover, as an umbrella species, conserving the black bear means protecting large, diverse habitats that also support many other wildlife species. Its decline signals broader biodiversity loss across Pakistan’s temperate forests,” he added.",2025-10-21,Anadolu Agency,1587,0.000179

The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes
military operations
, which tribal people also resist as they often lead to
displacements.
The remarks come a day after the KP CM
blamed
the federal government’s “flawed policy” for the resurgence of terrorism in KP, during his first official high-level meeting since
assuming
office on October 15, after the former CM Ali Amin Gandapur
resigned
earlier this month on the directions of party chairman Imran Khan.

He alleged that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other Constitutional rights”. He also criticised the Centre for providing KP Police “defective and old” armoured vehicles and asked that the vehicles be recalled.
Addressing the media today, the state minister took exception to the KP CM’s earlier remarks and stated, “the operation you are rejecting may serve you well politically, but it will also lead to loss of lives, for which you alone will be held responsible.”
Talal expressed disappointment that the “fight against terrorism and sacrifices made by soldiers were being overshadowed by politics”.
“You don’t want to fight against terrorists, you are scared, you have political motives,” said Talal, alleging that the PTI-led provincial government was choosing not to fight the war against terrorism, “so they could use it to blackmail the government.”
Citing Article 148 of the Constitution, the minister warned that “provinces can not unilaterally make any decision which affects the rest of the country”.
“The fight against terrorism is the entire country’s fight,” maintained the state minister for interior.
On the matter of the CM’s recent appointment, Talal said that it was a deliberate decision to elect someone “who would not hesitate to prioritise political point scoring and his chairman’s narrative over matters of national interests and his responsibilities as the chief minister”.
Responding to KP CM’s comments about “defective bulletproof vehicles”, the minister maintained that “it was unfortunate that CM Afridi was returning necessary equipment to make the Centre look weak for political point scoring”.
“If you did not like the bulletproof cars, then maybe give your own instead,” he said, stressing that the KP govt was “not fighting a war but only wasting time and creating unnecessary drama.”
A day earlier, the minister had called the move “immature” and a setback in the fight against terrorism, the
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)
reported.
“What’s unfortunate is that the police officers in KP are fighting terrorists without any equipment,” he said, adding that the provincial govt was “refusing to stand with them.”
He also claimed that there was a “different agenda” at play, stating that “changing the chief minister was never about benefiting the people”.
Although the federal government in August
ruled out
a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the
National Action Plan.
Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.",2025-10-21,Dawn.com,875,0.000126
https://www.dawn.com/news/1950389/two-sc-judges-warn-new-code-of-conduct-will-restrict-judicial-freedom-create-avenues-for-control,"Two SC judges warn new code of conduct will restrict judicial freedom, create avenues for control - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","Supreme Court’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar have said that changes recently made to the Code of Conduct for superior court judges will restrict judicial freedom and create avenues for internal and external control, it emerged on Tuesday.
On October 18, the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) approved
far-reaching amendments
to the Code of Conduct, barring superior court judges from engaging in public controversy or media interaction, particularly on political questions, and introducing new restrictions on social and diplomatic activity.
Chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the meeting was attended virtually by Justices Shah and Akhtar. Lahore High Court (LHC) Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and her Islamabad counterpart Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar attended in person.
In the latest letter penned to the SJC chair and its members, Justices Shah and Akhtar said they had submitted their unsigned written comments at the start of the meeting in a letter dated October 17.
The duo then revised those comments to incorporate the “unfortunate and constitutionally inappropriate development” of the
National Judicial Policy-Making Committee
(NJPMC) discussing the Code of Conduct when the matter “lies solely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the SJC”.
“These proposals, if adopted, will restrict judicial freedom, transform an open and collegial institution into a closed and hierarchical one, and create avenues for control, both internal and external,” Justices Shah and Akhtar said.
Among the various tweaks, the judges strongly objected to the amendment made to the Code of Conduct’s Article V, under which judges are prohibited from speaking, writing, debating or commenting publicly on controversial matters and on political questions, even where questions of law arise.
They also took exception to the insertion of Article XIX, which provides an “institutional response” for judges facing any “influence”, under which they will report to their respective chief justice, who will then inform the CJP.
“In the current political and institutional climate — where pressures on the judiciary are widely perceived — such a mechanism can be manipulated to suppress legitimate whistleblowing by judges who resist external interference,” the judges wrote.
On the incorporation of the 2003 SJC Resolutions/Guidelines, which includes a bar on attending social, cultural, political and diplomatic functions, the judges said it “reduces the judiciary’s visibility and connection to the community”.
Another clause treats the soliciting of conference or meeting invitations from foreign or international bodies as misconduct. The judges criticised this as well, noting that judges attend such seminars to “enhance comparative learning and professional competence-activities that strengthen judicial capacity, not diminish it”.
Justices Shah and Akhtar detailed 10 “weaknesses and risks” posed by the amendments to Article V alone, which is related to judges’ freedom of speech.
“The phrases ‘public controversy’ and ‘political questions’ are undefined and could encompass nearly every matter of constitutional or legal significance,” they pointed out.
They expressed the apprehension that the “fear of being accused of ‘public controversy’ will compel judges to remain silent on matters of constitutional importance, even outside the courtroom”.
“This self-censorship undermines intellectual growth within the judiciary and weakens the development of constitutional jurisprudence.”
On the ban on “any interaction with the media”, the judges said it “amounts to a gag order, imposing total silence and insulating the institution from public scrutiny”.
On the new rule for judges to “not cause any judicial or administrative matter to be discussed publicly”, they said it shields the judiciary from external accountability and disables judges from defending the institution publicly.
Justices Shah and Akhtar also cautioned that the provision “could be selectively invoked against outspoken judges, particularly those critical of executive
overreach or internal mismanagement”, creating a “chilling effect” and opening the door to disciplinary misuse.
The judges further said: “In Pakistan’s fragile democratic environment, such a clause can be easily weaponised by executive or establishment forces through compliant leadership to silence independent voices within the judiciary.”
“During ‘testing times’ for democracy, judicial independence requires openness, moral courage-not silence or conformity.”
Postponement sought as IHC CJ seniority, 26th Amendment under challenge
Justices Shah and Akhtar also listed multiple reservations regarding the procedure of the amendments’ approval.
The judges recalled that in a letter dated October 13,  they had “proposed that the present [SJC] meeting be postponed, or the Council be re-constituted, given that the seniority and status of Honourable Justice Sarfraz Dogar in his high court are
under challenge
” before the SC.
“The outcome of that case will directly determine his eligibility to serve as a member of the Supreme Judicial Council.”
Justices Shah and Akhtar also highlighted that the 26th Amendment
remains under challenge
before the SC.
“Until that matter is decided, the status of the chairperson and one of the members is sub judice. Constitutional propriety therefore requires that no amendments to the Code be undertaken until that issue is settled,” they said.
The earlier October 13 letter stated, “While we would obviously not wish to comment on
sub judice
matters, it goes without saying that there is always an inherent uncertainty involved in any litigation, no matter how sanguine one may be about the outcome.”
It added that the decision in that case could directly affect Justice Dogar’s membership of the SJC, and consequently the council’s composition. The judge had also suggested it would be appropriate “if Justice Dogar recuses himself, then the council may proceed with its meetings/proceedings”.
“The decision in those proceedings can directly affect the Hon’ble Judge’s membership of, and consequently the composition of the Council.
They noted that since “three chief justices participating today (October 18) are ex officio members of both the NJPMC and the SJC, their participation in approving the amendments at the NJPMC meant that the majority of the SJC had effectively predecided the matter before it was even placed before the Council”.",2025-10-21,Umer Mehtab,1623,0.000182

Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about the lack of access to the party founder and how family, friends and party leaders are hindered from meeting him.
Afridi, who was elected as the provincial chief minister last week, was
denied a meeting
with Imran during a visit to the prison on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, he said he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran and seeking his input.
He claimed he had officially notified the Punjab government and the federal government of his plan to visit Adiala, but received no response, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not reply to his subsequent request, made during a phone call, to facilitate a meeting with Imran. He approached the Islamabad High Court on Friday,
seeking permission
to meet Imran.
Questioned about the matter in an interview on
DawnNewsTV
show ‘Doosra Rukh’, Rehman said: “I hope this meeting will take place in the coming days. The federal government has asked the provincial government to arrange this so the cabinet there (in KP) can be formed.”
Asked again whether the Centre had issued a direction for the meeting to the Punjab government, Rehman clarified that while an order could not be given since the provincial governments were autonomous, the prime minister had “urged” the provincial authorities and the federal government had also requested to “do this as soon as possible”.
Rehman added that as per his information, the Punjab government was devising a mechanism and fulfilling all “cordial formalities”, adding that the meeting would be “held soon”.
Speaking
during Monday’s KP Assembly session, CM Afridi said that he wrote letters to the chief justice of Pakistan and federal and provincial governments and even petitioned the Islamabad High Court (IHC) for ensuring his meeting with Imran, but to no avail.
He said he would challenge the federal government over the continued denial of his meeting with Imran and would boycott meetings called by it.",2025-10-21,Nadir Guramani,606,0.000105
