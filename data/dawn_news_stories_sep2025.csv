The statement from the army brass, released after the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) held at General Headquarters (GHQ), comes in the wake of last week’s
provocative remarks
by top Indian civil-military leadership.
Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. He had said that Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion.
The Pakistan military had issued a strong response to the remarks and wanred that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and the country would “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”. It had said that “those seeking to establish a new normal must know that Pakistan has established a new normal of response , which will be swift, decisive and destructive”.
A statement from the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued today said that the military brass also took notice of the remarks in today’s CCC.
“The forum pledged to counter any Indian aggression with a swift and decisive response, shattering any perceived notion of India’s relative safety accruing from geography. Any imaginary new normal will be met with a new normal of swift retributive response,” the ISPR said.
It added that the military leadership expressed grave concerns about the recent “irresponsible and unwarranted provocative statements” by the Indian civil and military leadership.
“Such rhetoric conforms to the well-known Indian propensity of whipping up war hysteria for political benefits. The participants agreed that unwarranted warmongering is likely to lead to heightened tensions and will endanger regional peace and security,” the ISPR said.
The military’s media wing said the meeting commenced with prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks “orchestrated by Indian terror proxies”.
Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir “commended the spirit, resolve and determination of the Pakistan armed forces in war against foreign-sponsored terror proxies and during extensive relief and rescue operations in the aftermath of recent floods, in conjunction with civil administration and other law enforcement agencies”, the statement said.
It further added that the forum undertook a “comprehensive review’’ of ongoing counter-terrorism operations, emerging threat paradigms and operational readiness and reaffirmed that the military remained ready to “thwart inimical designs of Pakistan’s adversaries across all domains”.
The ISPR also said that the CCC members affirmed that the “existing nexus between terror and crime with vested political patronage, which is gravely hurting the interests of the state and security of its people, will not be allowed to continue anymore, come what may”.
The military’s media wing further said that the participants expressed their resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the
Fitna al-Khawarij
and
Fitna al-Hindustan
.
Fitna al-Khawarij
is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as
Fitna al-Hindu­stan
— a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
The participants also acknowledged the significance of Pakistan’s recent high-level diplomatic engagements and reaffirmed their commitment to global and regional peace. In particular, the military welcomed the landmark mutual defence deal between Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and said it underscored “shared values, mutual respect, and a joint vision” for peace and security in the Middle Eastern and South Asian regions.
Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark
mutual defence agreement
, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh in September.
“The forum reiterated Pakistan’s uncompromising support for the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people for their right to self-determination, as enshrined in relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The forum also reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and hoped for early ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. The forum reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance on Palestine issue, voicing support for the two-state solution with an independent Palestinian state, based on pre-1967 borders and Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
“In his closing remarks, the COAS, directed the commanders to ensure the highest standards of operational readiness, discipline, physical fitness, innovation and responsiveness. The COAS expressed full confidence in the operational preparedness of Pakistan Army to counter threats across the entire spectrum, from conventional and sub-conventional, to hybrid and asymmetric threats,” the military’s media wing concluded.",2025-10-08,Dawn.com,1363,0.000162
https://www.dawn.com/news/1948886,SMOG IS THE FIFTH SEASON - DAWN.COM,"IT is not rare anymore for Lahore to be the most polluted city in the world, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) crossing all known hazard zones. Just days ago, it was 180 when it should have been less than 100 to be acceptable.
Alarmingly, it was September, which is not even considered part of the dreaded smog season when AQI values soar past the 1,000 mark; twice of the upper cap of the AQI hazardous range.
In the IQAir country ranking for 2024, Pakistan was third on the list of countries having the worst air quality, following only Chad and Bangladesh. In 2024, AQI in several cities of Punjab crossed the hazardous level.
Other than Lahore, these cities were Multan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot and Rawalpindi/Islamabad. In November last year, the AQI crossed 1,000 for the first time since the monitoring of smog started in Lahore. In the same month it touched 1,173.
According to the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative (PAQI), the pollution of PM2.5 — fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health — pollution increased by 25pc in Lahore in 2024 compared to 2023. The average pollution level also went up by 23pc compared to last year. These are serious numbers demanding serious actions.
Activist Dr Ajaz Anwar, spearheading the Lahore Conservation Society, says there was a time when most people would walk in the city and ride bicycles. “One cannot even think of these activities in contemporary Lahore because the city has been expanded in such a way that there is no space left for either pedestrians or cyclists.” Lack of public transport, he says, has led to an influx of motorcycles and rickshaws that emit smoke and pollute the air.
LIFE EXPECTANCY IN PUNJAB HAS GONE DOWN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT NEXT?
Zainab Naeem, an environmental scientist working with the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), also believes that other than the natural phenomena involved, human activities — vehicular emissions, stubble burning, brick kilns and industrial emissions — are behind the spike in air pollution.
Worryingly, the expert expects to have a more severe spell of smog this winter due to heavy floods across Punjab in both Pakistan and India. “There were long spells of rains and heavy flooding in the riverine areas of Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab across the border. The floods brought silt and mud with them and left it behind on the planes when the floodwater receded. The moisture in the air holds dust particles rising from the silt left behind by floodwater for a longer time and this can cause more pollution, hence more smog,” she warns.
However, environmental lawyer Ahmed Rafay Alam sees a silver lining, saying that many areas in the rice belt of Pakistan had the crop washed away completely by the floods, which means there would be less crop residue burning this season.
The eastern wind that takes smog and air pollution away from Pakistan may come in October this year instead of November when it normally starts blowing. “The early wind and less crop burning may lead to less intense smog, and, if it happens, the change would occur only owing to the natural phenomenon,” he stresses.
Talking about the administrative issues involved, Rafay points out that after the 18th Amendment, the environment became a provincial subject, and the provinces made their own laws. The problem, he points out, is that they just copied the earlier federal law without doing any extensive work on it. Punjab was no different. While hearing a public interest petition in 2016, the then chief justice of the Lahore High Court asked the provincial government to make a policy on environment which the relevant department subsequently presented in the high court. A Smog Commission was formed on the order of the court, which prepared a policy document to mitigate and control smog and air quality in 2017, recalls Rafay, regretting that a political change in 2018 changed everything. He suggests the formation of new laws as the current ones were drafted 30 years ago.
The government, says Zainab, should take steps to increase buffer zones to improve air quality, and focus on building a circular economy that may utilise crop residue as raw material for other products. “Industrial emissions should be controlled, and air pollution data should be collected to make effective strategies to fight air pollution.
Data should be collected from the Indian Punjab as well, using satellite technology in case the Indian government does not share it voluntarily. Cycling should be promoted, and the entry of heavy vehicles in cities should be banned except for certain days of the week,” she adds. Dr Ajaz also suggests increasing the green cover in the cities, but regrets that even though trees produce oxygen, “it is tragic that trees are being taken down in the name of development”.
While all these suggestions sound good, Rafay throws a spanner in the works by pointing out that even if Punjab starts taking all the required action to control air pollution today, it would take at least eight to 10 years to make a significant change, or bring the air back to bearable level. “And it will require massive investments at each stage.” Life expectancy in Lahore has already been reduced by eight years.
Punjab needs urgent action without hoping for an early result. This is quite a conundrum.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1948887,Time for Reorientation - DAWN.COM,"AIR pollution in Pakistan represents a multifaceted environmental and public policy challenge, stemming from a variety of sources that collectively degrade air quality and public health across the nation.
Key contributors include vehicular emissions from an expanding fleet of ill-maintained vehicles, industrial discharges from sectors like textiles and cement, dust from construction activities and unpaved roads, emissions from brick kilns that rely on low-quality fuel, and seasonal practices such as stubble burning. These factors interact with meteorological conditions, such as temperature inversions in winter, to trap the pollutants and create dense smog layers.
Among these, stubble burning emerges as a particularly hazardous issue during the autumn months, when farmers in Punjab incinerate crop residue post-harvest, releasing vast quantities of particulate matter and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that exacerbate the already bad pollution levels.
Stubble burning is deeply intertwined with the agrarian evolution of South Asia, particularly the rice-wheat cropping system that dominates Punjab.
Time is surely up for stubble burning as a routing agricultural practice in Pakistan. However, top-down solutions are bound to fail just as they have failed every single time we have tried.
This intensive rotation with rice sown in the monsoon (June-October), followed immediately by wheat in the dry winter (November-April) has its genesis in the Green Revolution of the 1960s. High-yielding varieties promised food security, but they came with a hidden cost: shorter crop durations and mechanised harvesting that left behind tall, dense stubble residue difficult to manage manually. In Pakistan, where Punjab’s 80 per cent mechanised rice harvest mirrors India’s, farmers face a mere 15-20-day window to clear the fields for wheat sowing, lest yields plummet owing to delayed planting. Similarly, in India’s northwestern states, the same Green Revolution dynamics have led to widespread mechanisation, amplifying the regional pollution footprint.
To the farmers, burning offers a swift solution.
It sterilises soil against pests, releases short-term nutrients like phosphorus and potassium, and costwise it is far cheaper than other methods that add up to 30pc to labour expenses. A 2019 emission inventory spanning 2000-14 reveals how this practice scaled with agricultural intensification: annual rice residue production hit 8.5 million tonnes, with 3.6-5 million tonnes burned between October and January to expedite wheat planting. In India, parallel trends show even larger scales, with over 23 million tonnes of rice stubble burned annually in Punjab and Haryana alone, contributing significantly to transboundary emissions that drift into Pakistan’s airspace during prevailing westerly winds in autumn.
Colonial-era land policies favoured monocropping, and post-independence subsidies for water and fertilisers further cemented this trend. In south Punjab villages, a 2019 study found that 85pc of the respondents viewed burning as a cultural norm, inherited from generations who saw it as essential for survival amid labour shortages and rising input costs. Yet, as climate variability shortens monsoons and intensifies winters, what was once adaptive has become maladaptive. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) attributes 20pc of Pakistan’s air pollutants to this source, a figure that underscores how historical expediency feeds an ongoing crisis. Comparable figures in India attribute up to 30pc of Delhi’s winter PM2.5 to stubble fires from neighbouring states, highlighting the shared historical roots and cross-border ramifications of this practice.
The smoke from stubble fires does not dissipate; it infiltrates lungs, soils and skies, weaving a web of health hazards. An
analysis estimates
that incinerating 63 million tonnes of South Asian stubble annually results in 1.2 million tonnes of particulate matter, 0.6 million tonnes of methane, and 91 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2)-equivalents that spike PM2.5 levels by 40-60pc during harvest peaks. In Pakistan, this manifests as winter smog, where thermal inversions trap pollutants, turning Air Quality Index (AQI) in urban centres, such as
Lahore
and Multan, to hazardous levels and beyond. Across the border,
Delhi experiences analogous spikes
during the same period, as satellite data reveals plumes from Indian Punjab merging with those from Pakistani Punjab to form a regional haze.
The cost to human health is staggering. The Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) reports that crop burning shaves 4.3 years off average life expectancy in polluted hotspots, with over 20,000 premature adult deaths and 160,000 disability adjusted life years lost annually in Pakistan alone. Infants and children bear the brunt, as is evident from a study that appeared in the journal Nature. It highlights how across India and Pakistan in-utero PM2.5 exposure from stubble burning results in 24-26 additional infant deaths and 30-36 child deaths per 1,000 births. Respiratory ailments surge, while cardiovascular and neurological diseases affect thousands more. In Lahore, where 14 million residents inhale this hazardous air, hospital admissions for pollution related illnesses triple during the smog season, costing the exchequer significant sums in lost productivity. In Delhi, similar surges overwhelm healthcare systems, with studies estimating 10,000-30,000 annual deaths attributable to stubble-related pollution.
Environmentally, the fallout erodes the very foundation of our breadbasket. Burning volatilises nitrogen (75pc loss), phosphorus and sulphur, slashing soil fertility by 25-30pc and microbial diversity, which hampers water retention and increases erosion. Black carbon, the second-largest warming agent after CO2, accelerates glacial melt in the Himalayas, threatening downstream water and food security for 1.9 billion South Asians. Economically, air pollution devours 6.5pc of GDP, up to $12 billion yearly, through diseases, absenteeism and dips in crop yield owing to acid rain and ozone formation.
A
bureaucrat incentive experiment
, discussed in the aforementioned Nature study, serves as a caution against relying solely on command-and-control mechanisms to address the issue. Analysing 18 million grid observations (2012-22) across India and Pakistan, it found that when winds blow smoke into a particular district, officials slash fires by 10-13pc via targeted penalties. In Lahore, a similar order reduced fires by 9pc in monitored blocks, as per satellite data. Yet, spillover effects persist. The study reveals that the incidence of stubble burning rose by 15pc when winds favoured neighbours, highlighting enforcement’s jurisdictional blind spots. This transboundary dynamic is reflected in India-Pakistan interactions as well, where Indian fires increase when winds direct smoke towards Pakistan.
To effectively address the persistent challenge of stubble burning in South Asia, policymakers should prioritise a holistic environmental policy framework. Such an approach will integrate key facets of environmental communication, emphasising stakeholder engagement over reliance on traditional command-and-control measures, like bans and fines, which have not been sustainable. A communication centred approach could foster voluntary adoption by reframing the issue from a mere regulatory burden to a shared health and economic imperative. Use of vivid, localised narratives in campaigns that depict the direct impacts of smog on family health can go a long way in facilitating this. This framing could build empathy and urgency, drawing on psychological tools like future-self visualisation exercises where farmers imagine the degraded land inheritance for their children, ultimately yielding higher compliance rates than punitive measures alone. A compelling global parallel is Indonesia’s Pertamina Corporate Social Responsibility programme for peatland fires, where corporate communication reframed fire-prone practices as community threats through targeted narratives on health and economic losses.
Building on this, policy recommendations should include audience segmentation and targeting to tailor messages for diverse groups, ensuring relevance and overcoming the ‘one-size-fits-all’ pitfalls of command and-control strategies. A more holistic policy would segment communications, delivering Punjabi language podcasts on bio-decomposers to frontline farmers, workshops for community unions, and datadriven briefs for policymakers. Besides, participatory dialogue and co-design should be embedded in policy to co-create solutions with stakeholders, contrasting sharply with the top-down enforcement of measures.
Transboundary policy options are essential given the cross-border flow of pollution. Establishing a joint Pakistan-India task force under frameworks like the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) could harmonise air quality standards, share real-time satellite monitoring data on fire incidents, and co-develop incentives for alternatives to burning, such as cross-border subsidies for specific machinery.
Bilateral agreements could include mutual enforcement protocols through ‘smog diplomacy’ initiatives. Such regional approaches, supported by international bodies, would amplify national efforts and mitigate the blame-game that hinders progress.
Southeast Asia’s haze mitigation efforts offer direct lessons here. In particular, the Asean Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (2002, revised 2014), has curbed recurrent peatland fires in Indonesia and Malaysia via regional monitoring networks, early warning systems and joint suppression teams. The result has been reduced haze episodes by up to 70pc in compliant years, and fostering trust through annual ministerial meetings and public awareness drives that depoliticise the issue.
Finally, robust evaluation and feedback loops should underpin these policies to ensure iterative improvement.
By integrating satellite verification in farmer apps, annual reports on health benefits, like reduced child mortality, and goal-setting for zero-burn villages, policies can effectively refine long-term strategies. Addressing complex environmental and public policy issues, such as air pollution, through command and control or siloed approaches has not worked. Hence, what is required is a sea change in our thinking that places collaboration before conflict and collective human wellbeing before shortsighted political goals.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949486/how-to-fix-blurry-images-and-enhance-photos-with-ai,How to fix blurry images and enhance photos with AI - Sponsored - DAWN.COM,"Have you ever faced the problem of having blurry and grainy photos? It’s quite frustrating when those important images turn out out of focus or with such low resolution that you can’t post or print them clearly. Fortunately, today this problem has a simple solution. You don’t need professional knowledge or expensive programmes. With an AI
image quality enhancer
like Artguru, anyone can make their photos look sharper and more detailed. In this guide, you’ll discover exactly how to do it.
Why do photos turn out blurry and with low definition?
The low quality of a photo is a general term that can hide different problems. The good news is that modern neural networks can solve most of them. It’s very likely that you recognise your situation in one of the following points:
1. The photo is too small.
This is the main reason. Images downloaded from the internet, messaging services (like WhatsApp) or social media are usually very compressed and lose size. When you try to enlarge them, they instantly become blurry.
2. Slight camera shake.
Even if you try to hold the camera steady, a minimal vibration of your hands when you press the button can cause a slight blur. As a result, the overall sharpness of the image decreases, even if it’s not always obvious to the naked eye.
3. Movement in the scene.
If you were photographing a person, an animal or a moving car, they might appear slightly out of focus against a sharp background.
4. Focusing error.
Sometimes, the camera’s autofocus focuses on the background instead of the main subject. That’s why a person’s face may look less sharp than the trees behind them.
5. Low-light photography.
At dusk or in a dark room, photos often show digital noise, a fine grain that “eats up” the details.
6. Scanned old photos.
Over time, paper photographs lose colour, get scratched and lose sharpness. When you scan them, all these defects are transferred to the digital file.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949540/why-are-multinationals-exiting-pakistan,WHY ARE MULTINATIONALS EXITING PAKISTAN? - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"There have been a flurry of announcements over the last few years by various multinational corporations (MNCs), either exiting Pakistan or significantly scaling down their operations here.  Some of the prominent ones include
Procter & Gamble
, Shell, Caltex and Eli Lily, among others.
There has also been a significant slowdown in manufacturing activity, where more than half of products tracked by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics through the Large Scale Manufacturing index have exhibited a median drop in production of 10 percent annually, over the last two years.
The gradual exodus of MNCs from Pakistan is a multifaceted affair that cannot be viewed through a mundane political lens. It is a mix of evolving strategies at a global or regional level for the respective entity, as well as a lacklustre economic and investment environment locally.
This write-up explores how the business models of MNCs have evolved over the years and how a shift in global trade is catalysing the exodus. There is also some introspection about how consistently elevated sovereign risk, and one of the more regressive taxation regimes in the world, has pushed any kind of formal business over the edge in Pakistan.
Even as the government touts policies to attract foreign investment, a number of multinational giants have been scaling back or exiting from Pakistan in recent times. What is going on here?
Is this the global economic environment at play or does this reflect deep fractures in the
country’s economic and regulatory framework? And can anything be done about it?
HISTORIC CONTEXT
Many MNCs that exist in developing markets were birthed by parent entities operating in those areas, mostly to serve the interests of colonial powers, or to consolidate the same.
As  the sun started to set on colonialism after World War II, the emperor got new clothes, the MNC in this case, and they all got a makeover, trying to shy away from a troubled history. It can be an MNC that sold soaps and was notorious for operating palm plantations through bonded labour in Central Africa, or an MNC that basically led the Nazi war machine but now sells innocuous chemicals.
The history of MNCs has been dramatic and they have evolved with time. Only recently, after 355 years in operations, did the Hudson’s Bay Company shut down, after laying the foundations of Canada through trading fur across the Atlantic and eventually morphing into its largest landowner — only to be succeeded by a chain of department stores that were killed by e-commerce. They could survive multiple wars and the death of the Empire, but could not survive the post-pandemic transition to e-commerce shopping.
During the late 2000s, there was a similar mass exodus of financial institutions, not just from Pakistan but from other developing markets as well. This was largely due to higher compliance costs and the realisation that the only way to give economic returns to shareholders was to scale up and become one of the top five institutions in the respective country. It is only through scale that one can extract economic returns; without scale, they struggle and keep losing market share.
Many of these institutions survived the Opium Wars in China, and others, only to be forced to scale down by activist shareholders. Currently, only one bank from the times of the Empire continues to exist as a shell of its former self, while the rest have exited not just Pakistan but other emerging markets as well.
THE CHINESE CENTURY
The current wave of MNC exits can be partially attributed to the emergence of China as the world’s factory. This led to production of goods at a scale never seen before, and with scale comes lower cost. In emerging markets with relatively low household incomes, cost competitiveness remains critical and China provided the same.
Most MNCs operating in Pakistan, or those that have left, were largely involved in production of low value-added or primary products. Making diapers, washing detergent, or a basic generic drug does not require sophisticated knowledge or skill that cannot be replicated elsewhere. As China continued to compete on cost, local production became increasingly uncompetitive.
This led to the emergence of local brands that competed on price and made the overall competitive environment more intense. MNCs, instead of doubling down and attempting to scale, figured it might be easier to shut down operations and revert to a distribution model. Why bother manufacturing when you can import and trade the same? This is where the industrial policy of the country completely failed.
In many cases of consumer goods, some MNCs even produced advertisements at scale in Southeast Asia, assuming that all people of the Subcontinent look the same, subtly mocking actual paying consumers in the process. One can mock consumers only for so long and, in the case of primary products, consumers are often very price sensitive — a strong brand can compensate only to a certain extent for a price-conscious customer. As local brands started to prop up, the operating space for MNCs became further constrained, eventually leading to a point where the consumer gravitated towards local brands.
‘GREED IS GOOD’
The fictional character, Gordon Gekko, uttered the famous words “Greed is good” in the film Wall Street, while exemplifying the role of free markets in arriving at an optimal solution that benefits everyone and shareholders the most. In matters of capital allocation, shareholders lately are not swayed by emotional concepts such as patriotism or nationalism.
More recently, German engineering and chemical behemoths started moving out of Germany to the US and other jurisdictions where energy costs were lower — not because they were any less German, but because they were losing the competitive advantage provided by cheap Russian gas, which stopped following the initiation of the Russia-Ukraine war.
Similarly, a large number of financial institutions and energy companies moved their headquarters from the UK to other jurisdictions post-Brexit. A shareholder is more interested in how their economic returns can be maximised and makes decisions accordingly. Any other considerations may be noble but are noise at best. If a jurisdiction cannot provide the requisite economic returns, the MNC (or any rational business) will eventually shut down that business.
In the absence of perpetual state subsidies, or protection as a perpetual infant, which are hallmarks of economic policies in Pakistan, no business can survive without being competitive in the local environment.
INVEST IN PAKISTAN? WHY?
Now let’s turn our attention specifically to Pakistan’s economic environment.
An economy’s gross domestic product (GDP) is a function of private consumption, government consumption, investments and net trade (more exports and fewer imports). The cumulative sum of all these factors leads to the calculation of GDP. Over the last 10 years, Pakistan has evolved into a consumption-oriented economy, wherein 99 percent of our GDP is essentially consumption.
To provide more context, for a typical lower middle-income economy, consumption makes up 81 percent of GDP, while the average for South Asia is 72 percent of GDP. This effectively means that we do not invest, produce, or export a lot — we just import and consume.
As we import more, we need more foreign currency, because that is how one buys imports, and when there isn’t much foreign currency available, this leads to the Pakistani rupee (PKR) losing its value, triggering a spurt of inflation before it settles, only for this Groundhog Day situation to repeat again.  If saner heads do not prevail, we may see the same happening again within the next 18 months.
Before we can produce anything, we need to invest in productive capacity first. The Investment-to-GDP ratio for Pakistan has consistently remained in the range of 12 percent, while that for South Asia is 32 percent, and for lower middle-income countries, it is 30 percent. If Pakistan ever wants to be a middle-income country, it needs to achieve and maintain an Investment-to-GDP ratio in the range of 25-30 percent consistently.
It is only through investment in productive capacity that we can produce more, create more jobs and generate an economic spillover effect that leads to improved household incomes. No country has ever become a middle-income economy, or better, without investing in itself. There is literally no other way — it is simply not possible to become prosperous just through consumption.
Investment in an economy is mostly a domestic affair, but we have it completely flipped. The government and its coterie of sycophants continue to beat the drums of foreign direct investment (FDI) without any introspection. For lower middle-income economies, FDI makes up around four percent of total investment, while for selected middle-income countries’ economies, it hovers in the range of five to 12 percent of total investment.
Only in the case of Vietnam is FDI maintained in the range of 12 percent. Effectively, domestic investment makes up more than 90 percent of investment across the board, a fact we completely ignore in the rush to sign off another Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which is as good as exchanging business cards at a conference.
There is absolutely no reason why foreign capital would gravitate towards an economy where domestic investors are also reluctant to invest. Even when they do invest, they invest in non-productive segments, such as real-estate, largely due to an atrociously regressive taxation policy that penalises formal investment, production and value-added initiatives.
Digging deeper, investment is largely a function of savings, and given the state of financial exclusion and an inefficient taxation regime, there is little to no incentive to save through formal financial channels, resulting in a scenario where most savings find their way to inefficient avenues, such as real estate, stashing cash under the mattress, or gold.
None of these generate any worthwhile economic activity that can boost production. The investment problem cannot be solved without addressing the savings problem first. Policymakers currently continue to focus only on foreign direct investment, which does not solve any problem.
In a dysfunctional investment environment, the case to continue and expand operations in Pakistan remains weak. And it is further weakened through heightened sovereign risk, whether due to border skirmishes or the musical chairs that accompany leadership changes, eventually resulting in policy inconsistency.
THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS
The cost of doing business formally in Pakistan is much higher than the cost of doing business informally.
For example, an entity operating in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) space formally has to comply with all taxation and other financial or legal constraints. This can include a direct tax that can go as high as 40 percent, a contribution to the Workers’ Welfare Fund or Workers’ Profit Participation Fund that can exceed seven percent of Profit Before Tax, and a dividend tax of 15 percent. The effective tax an entity in the formal sphere pays exceeds 50 percent of its Profit Before Tax, even though the company is taking market risk.
Such an effective tax rate is much higher than in many developed economies. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) effective tax rate is 25.4 percent, while the highest is 34.8 percent in Columbia. In such a scenario, there is little reason for any entity to operate formally in an environment where half of its profitability is simply gobbled up by the State.
Similarly, any such company operating formally also has to comply with all Sales Tax requirements which, at 17 percent, are among the highest in the world, effectively discouraging more goods from coming into the taxation net. Meanwhile, any entity operating informally and selling smuggled goods can completely avoid paying this Sales Tax, effectively cannibalising the sales of the entity operating in the formal sphere.
Such a structure is so lopsided that an MNC operating formally and selling goods while paying all taxes may be cannibalised by the same goods it is selling, but which are either smuggled or imported at a lower tax rate, wherein the distributor and retailer can avoid paying Sales Tax through one way or another. Effectively, FMCG companies get cannibalised by their own products, due to an inefficient and perverse taxation regime.

DETERIORATING REAL INCOMES
Pakistan has been plagued by economic stagnation for the last seven years, if not more. Whenever an MNC enters a country, the expectation is that overall prosperity levels will gradually increase and so will household incomes. Due to economic stagnation, however, per capita income levels have actually gone down in American dollar terms. Moreover, adjusting for the tax burden, real income after tax has gone down even more.
Over a seven-year period, real income has effectively gone down by 45-50 percent and, after adjusting the same for taxes, it has gone down by more than 50 percent, with households across the spectrum (with the rare exception of those right at the top) losing half their disposable income.
It is estimated that expenditure on food made up 47 percent of the poorest 20 percent of households’ budget in 2017-18.  Expenditure on food now makes up about 65 percent of the poorest 20 percent of households’ budget in 2024-25. This effectively means that more expenditure is being reallocated to meet basic existential needs, squeezing away demand from other areas, such as health and education.  Effectively, there is less disposable income to go around, which means a lower demand for products.
For a market such as Pakistan, an MNC typically introduces the lowest-margin and most basic quality of products. As real income levels go down, so does demand for such products. The demand drops so much that entities have to resort to ‘shrinkflation’ — reducing the size of a product while not increasing prices. Shrinkflation implies moving down the value chain rather than going up — and that is a death knell for any growth-oriented entity.
The earlier notion that economic growth may lead to prosperity and higher income levels, eventually leading to demand for higher-margin and slightly more premium products, falls flat. Due to such a scenario, MNCs can see their revenue and profitability decline in American dollar terms while, at a shareholder level, this is seen as ineffective allocation of capital that can be reallocated elsewhere or returned to shareholders as dividends.

A THRIVING GREY MARKET
MNCs have to operate within a framework of compliance, even though their history may be dotted with all sorts of ethical discrepancies. As an example, in the case of petroleum products, there was a massive surge in the flow of gasoline and diesel from Pakistan’s western border through informal channels. The impact of such a flow led to a sharp reduction in the official sale of gasoline and diesel in 2022-23.
Officially, gasoline sales dropped by 20.6 percent, while diesel sales dropped by 37.1 percent in Sindh. We are specifically focusing on Sindh here because it provides granular details and is more transparent with public dissemination of data. The sale of petroleum products is a fairly stable metric — a significant drop implies substitution of the same with another product, or a product that is not captured by the formal economy.
As sales of smuggled petroleum products increased, it became increasingly difficult for MNCs to compete. Many petrol stations could simply blend formal and smuggled products, pretending nothing was happening, and capture the delta that emerged from taxes, which had to be paid on formal goods but not on smuggled products.
As such activity took hold, MNCs started losing market share, while reputational risk became ever more apparent, potentially leading to heavier penalties elsewhere. Inadvertently, in such a scenario, an exit from a market is better than losing market share and risking penalties in the process.
Similarly, Pakistan could never see the emergence of any serious MNC in the wholesale and retail space, largely because of the inability of MNCs to maintain multiple books of accounts to manage smuggling or goods trading in the informal economy. Local players can manage a profitable suite of formal and smuggled products, while MNCs would not be able to compete with such a product mix. In such an environment, where one is simply not able to compete because of a lopsided taxation environment, the market holds little promise for any serious growth.
A pertinent metric of the prevalence of an informal economy is the ratio of Private Sector Business Deposits to Government Deposits, because a government will always have to use banking channels for its transactions, but private sector businesses can avoid formal channels. The ratio clearly demonstrates a significant drop, as the deposit growth of private sector businesses continued to lag behind government deposits, with most businesses preferring to operate in the grey, or as individuals to avoid taxation.

PRICE FIXING
The government has an obsession with fixing prices, a practice that has historically never worked, with thousands of years of economic history clearly demonstrating that the wisdom of policymakers cannot catch up to the invisible hand of the market. The government, and its different tentacles, has a habit of fixing prices, whether for medicine, electricity, gas, or something as mundane as milk or jalebis.
An economic environment where prices can be arbitrarily fixed leads to inefficient allocation of resources and does not allow businesses to compete in a fair environment. Fixing prices when costs increase results in losses for the producer, who then has to decide whether to continue with the business or completely change strategy.
The drop-off-a-cliff of the pharmaceutical industry, and its eventual plateauing, clearly demonstrates the same. Pharmaceutical production over the last three years has flat-lined and is much lower than in the years before that, even though the population continues to grow.
It can be seen in the production of tablets, syrups, capsules, injections and every other product. The demand continues to be there, but production has dropped as manufacturers moved towards a trading-oriented model. This is a classic case of shooting oneself in the foot: we destroy productive capacity through arbitrary pricing mechanisms and delayed drug approvals — and then we wonder why every pharmaceutical entity is packing up shop.

THE TAX ARBITRAGE
To keep it simple: if operating formally, an entity has to navigate the labyrinth of the tax code and incur additional compliance costs in managing it, while also having to increase the price of its final product. Meanwhile, if that product is competing with a product that can be smuggled or produced while evading taxes, the formally and honestly operating entity becomes uncompetitive, as its product is priced higher than others, resulting in erosion of market share.

An entity operating formally and complying with all regulatory requirements is actually priced out of the market. In such a scenario, there is no room for any sustainable growth, and companies eventually have to decide whether to operate formally and continue bleeding, or move towards the dark side.
HOW DO WE FIX THIS?
There is no magic bullet or magic pill. The road to reform is rocky and does not require an incessant number of conferences that do not solve any problem. It requires the will to solve the underlying economic problem, and that is a distortionary taxation and chaotic investment regime. The taxation structure needs to be fixed such that domestic investment is incentivised and risk-taking is rewarded rather than penalised.
This requires a significant reduction in corporate taxes and all other incidentals, whether that is super tax or other charges. It also requires a transition from the informal economy to the formal economy, and that can only happen with a massive reduction in currency in circulation and lower tax rates across the board. It is economically inefficient to operate formally in this economy; this is what needs to change.
The groupie behaviour to court foreign investors also needs to evolve. Solve problems for domestic investors first and foreign capital will follow. Capital follows risk-adjusted returns — it will gravitate towards whatever jurisdiction can provide more sustainable returns. The government should not be doing micro-interventions. It should be creating an enabling environment for competition to emerge and for attracting efficiency-seeking foreign direct investment. If we are being pushed to provide guaranteed returns for foreign capital, the battle is already lost at that point.
The government needs to step back from its obsessive-compulsive urge to set an arbitrary price for everything and creating unintended consequences in the process. Create an enabling environment and let the market operate. Creating an enabling environment is a long-drawn, boring process that cannot yield quick wins that can be celebrated with a half-page newspaper ad. This is where institutional development needs to happen, such that the enabling environment can sustain itself.
Savings need to be mobilised through formal financial infrastructure and reallocation of the same into non-productive areas needs to be penalised. It is easier to buy smuggled gold in Pakistan than to open a bank account or be part of the formal financial infrastructure — this is what needs to change.
None of the problems can be solved without solving for mobilisation of savings and redirecting the same towards productive enterprise. This is an economic problem and it needs to be addressed through economic tools rather than brute force, which never works on a long enough timeline.
The exodus of MNCs from Pakistan cannot be attributed to one specific issue but to a spectrum of issues that need to be addressed individually and as part of an economic reforms agenda. The first step in this journey is to accept that the wisdom of markets is far superior to the wisdom of policymakers. The sooner we accept this, the sooner we can start the reform journey.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949648/pakistan-sells-first-women-bank-to-uae-firm,Pakistan sells First Women Bank to UAE firm - Business - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday hailed the acquisition of First Women Bank Ltd (FWBL) by Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Company (IHC) as a milestone in Pakistan-UAE economic ties, saying the deal would pave the way for more joint ventures and partnerships across diverse sectors.
Speaking at a signing ceremony, the prime minister described the transaction as “the first drop of rain” in a broader effort to deepen economic collaboration with the United Arab Emirates.
The event marked the official transfer of a majority stake in FWBL to IHC under a government-to-government (G2G) framework. The UAE delegation was led by Sheikh Zayed bin Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, chairman of 2PointZero.
The federal cabinet had earlier approved the divestment of the government’s entire stake in FWBL, reportedly valued at $14.6 million (approximately Rs4.1 billion), a figure yet to be formally disclosed.
Buyer to inject Rs6.8bn more to meet capital requirements
In addition to acquiring the bank, IHC will meet the total minimum capital requirement of Rs10bn over five years. As of December 2024, FWBL’s equity stood at Rs3.2bn, with the new investor set to inject Rs6.8bn to bridge the gap.
Privatisation momentum
PM Shehbaz attributed the successful closure of the deal to the “determined and focused” leadership of Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Adviser on Privatisation Muhammad Ali. He reaffirmed his government’s commitment to restructuring state-owned enterprises and enabling private sector-led economic growth.
He added that FWBL’s founding mission — to support women entrepreneurs — would not only be preserved but also strengthened through professional management and targeted investments in sectors such as agriculture and industry.
IHC sees long-term growth
IHC Chief Executive Syed Basar Shueb said the investment signals confidence in Pakistan’s financial sector and reflects a shared vision for long-term development.
“We see strong potential in the country’s financial sector and look forward to supporting the bank’s modernisation journey by leveraging technology, automating banking processes, and advancing the use of AI in financial decision-making,” he said.
According to an official statement, this marks the first bank privatisation conducted under the
Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Act
2022. FWBL, established in 1989, currently operates 42 branches across Pakistan, serving retail, SME, and corporate clients.

• Khawaja Asif accuses Afghan Taliban of ‘sitting in India’s lap’; says terrorists will be made to pay heavy price, wherever they are
• Questions remain over Qatar-mediated talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in absence of clarity over who will attend
ISLAMABAD: With representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, a telling statement from the country’s defence minister indicated that the gloves were off, as Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack,
targeting
a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended their two-day
ceasefire
.
Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province, as security sources claimed that precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, reportedly killing dozens of fighters.
“If someone attacks Afgha­nistan, our forces are ready to respond,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Ariana News. However, Pakistani security sources pointed out that the ceasefire agreement bet­ween the Afghan government and Pakistan did not preclude stri­kes on terror outfits and their hideouts.
There was no statement from Pakistan’s military, but terrorists linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group had claimed responsibility for the attack on Khaddi Fort in Mir Ali, where a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the main gate of a military camp before attempting to stage an incursion earlier in the day.
Although there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on losses suffered, security sources claimed to have foiled the attack by eliminating all attackers.
The attack began on Friday morning, with local sources describing a massive explosion, followed by heavy gunfire as terrorists attempted to enter the military camp. Sources said that “all four” attackers were killed.
Heavy price to pay
In a telling statement posted to X (formerly Twitter), Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the relationship with Kabul would no longer be like it was in the past. “There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,” he wrote.
Mr Asif accused Afghanistan of “sitting in India’s lap and plotting conspiracies against Pakis­tan”, saying that Islamabad “can no longer afford to have relations with Kabul like in the past”.
“All Afghans on Pakistani soil will have to go back to their homeland,” he wrote. “Now they have their own government [or] caliphate in Kabul. It has been five years since the Islamic revolution… they must live with Pakistan as neighbours.”
In the post, the defence minister elaborated on the visits by Pakistani delegations to Kabul and provided figures for acts of terrorism by groups operating out of Afghanistan and the total number of casualties.
Since the Taliban took power in 2021, Pakistani foreign ministers visited Kabul four times; defence ministers and the ISI chiefs visited twice; the special representative and foreign secretaries carried out five visits each; the national security adviser visited once, and the Joint Coordination Committee had eight meetings in the Afghan capital.
He added that there were 225 border flag meetings, 836 protest notes and 13 demarches.
“From 2021 to date: 3,844 mar­tyred (civilians, military, and law enforcement agencies combined). Terrorist incidents: 10,347,” the defence minister listed.
Truce talks?
The fresh exchanges on Fri­day night cast a shadow over the ceasefire, which had been exte­nded just a few hours earlier, as well as the planned Doha talks.
“The ceasefire has been mutually extended by both Pakistan and Afghanistan till the end of the talks in Doha, Qatar. The talks are ready to begin [on Saturday],” a security source said on Friday evening at the conclusion of the initial 48-hour truce, which had been in effect since Wednesday.
The two-day ceasefire was largely observed without violations, but the dialogue initially agreed at the time of its announ­cement, aimed at addressing what Pakistan’s Foreign Office described as a “complex but solvable iss­ue”, failed to take place during that period.
Earlier in the day, at his weekly media briefing, outgoing Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan reiterated: “Afghanistan has become a central breeding ground for global terrorism.”
He warned the international community against complacency, adding, “We do not have to wait for a big disaster happening at the global scale before we take remedial action. This fire will spread. This has to be stopped.”
No bilateral initiative for talks emerged during the first phase of the truce. How­ever, Qatar, which along with Saudi Arabia had pushed both sides to halt hostilities, offered to host their meeting in Doha. The talks, initially slated for Thursday or Friday, were postponed by a day due to logistical issues and reluctance within the Taliban leadership to engage, sources said.
Reports from Afghanistan suggest that the Taliban delegation would include Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub Mujahid and intelligence chief Mullah Wasiq.  Pakistan’s Foreign Office stayed silent on the matter, but a late-evening meeting between National Security Adviser and ISI chief Lt. Gen. Asim Malik and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar suggested that Gen Malik may travel to Doha.
Return of victims’ remains
Earlier on Friday, Afghan authorities handed over the bodies of seven Pakistani citizens — including two security personnel — to Pakistani officials at the border following the deadly Taliban attack in the Chaman sector on Tuesday.
“The Taliban authorities handed over all the seven bodies to Pakistan through Hilal-e-Ahmar Pakistan (Red Cres­cent),” Abdul Wali Khan Ghabizai of the Balochistan chapter of the organization confirmed. He said Taliban officials announced at the Vesh Mandi border post that they were returning the remains of Pakistanis who had died “in the armed clash between two countries.”
The bodies were taken to the District Hospital in Chaman for identification and medicolegal formalities.
“Five bodies were brought to the district hospital Chaman,” said Dr Muhammad Awais, the hospital’s medical superintendent. “Four out of five martyrs have been identified as residents of the border town, while the fifth could not be identified so far.”
Two of the deceased were identified as security personnel — Naik Suleman and Sepoy Sabir — whose remains were later transferred to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta. Officials said that four of the five civilians were killed by mortar shell splinters, while one was hit in the forehead. The victims — identified as Syed Ali Adozai, Muhammad Asghar Ashaizai, Rozi Khan Salehzai, and Nasibullah Salehzai — were local daily-wage workers. They were buried in their native villages Friday evening.
Local residents in Chaman claimed that at least 12 Pakistani civ­ilians were killed earlier in Taliban attacks in Spin Boldak, the first Afghan district across the border.
Responding to reports that bodies of some Pakistani soldiers had been mutilated, the Foreign Office spokesman at the weekly media briefing said, “This kind of savagery, bestiality, is condemnable, and it needs to be condemned in the strongest words possible. This is beyond the pale. It is beyond humanity, and this has deeply offended us and deeply hurt the Pakistani people.” “It is not something to be forgi­ven and forgotten easily,” Mr Khan added.

ICC ‘appalled’ by deaths of three Afghan cricketers
The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday night issued a
statement
on the deaths of three Afghan cricketers in an airstrike in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, stating it was “deeply saddened and appalled”.
“The three young men had returned home after participating in a friendly cricket match when they were killed in an attack that also claimed the lives of several civilians,” the governing body said.
“The ICC strongly condemns this act of violence that has robbed families, communities, and the cricketing world of three bright talents whose only ambition was to play the sport they loved,” it added.
“The ICC stands in solidarity with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and echoes their grief.”
Afghanistan pulls out of series
In a
post
on social media platform X late Friday night, the ACB said three players — identified as Kabeer, Sibghatullah and Haroon — and “five other countrymen” from Urgun district were killed and seven others were injured in a strike.
It said the players had earlier travelled to Sharana to participate in a friendly cricket match.
“The ACB considers this a great loss for Afghanistan’s sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family,” the cricketing board said. As a result, the ACB decided to withdraw from participating in the tri-nation series scheduled to be played in November.
Afghanistan’s ace spinner Rashid Khan, in a
post
on X, said he welcomed the ACB’s decision to withdraw from the upcoming fixtures against Pakistan.
Pakistan was set to
host
the series from November 17 to 29.
Earlier, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Spokesperson Amir Mir told
Dawn.com
that the tri-series was still on and the third team would be finalised shortly.
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said earlier today that Pakistan had carried out precision strikes in Afghanistan against the outlawed Gul Bahadur group last night.
“All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” he said on X.
Cricket icon Shahid Afridi took to X and said that Afghanistan, in its acts of aggression, had forgotten Pakistan’s hospitality and “favours”.
“Pakistan has always stood by its Afghan brothers, considering the troubles of Afghans as its own trouble,” the former all-rounder wrote. “It opened its borders for its brothers. It accommodated 4 million refugees on its land.
“I have to say that in recent days, Afghanistan, forgetting all these favours, committed open aggression on the borders, to which our forces gave a full response,” he added.
Afridi wrote that Afghanistan should think of Pakistan as a brotherly Islamic country and should not allow its land to be used to aid acts of terrorism.
Pak Afghan tensions
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan
broke
a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence TTP terrorists in Afghanistan and has repeatedly
urged
Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. For its part, Kabul has batted aside accusations of support for militancy, alternating between vehement denials of Afghan soil being used to launch attacks across the border, assurances that have failed to materialise, and simply telling the Pakistani state to negotiate with the TTP.
Tensions have flared between the two countries over the last few days, with Kabul and Islamabad engaging in border skirmishes on October 11. According to the military, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists killed at the border following an attack from the Afghan side.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of
conducting
air strikes in its territory earlier in the week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintained that Kabul must “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
Subsequently, Afghan forces struck several Pak­istani posts and the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and artillery pounded Afghanistan’s posts, targeting hostile positions in the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika.
On Tuesday night, fighting
flared up again
on between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, a temporary ceasefire was then announced. The Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire was implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, and would last for 48 hours.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, however,
made it clear
on Thursday that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks.
“We decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready,” he said, adding that if the Taliban were serious, they would initiate steps to hold talks.
On Friday, with representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan. It had come after an attack on a military installation in North Waziristan and after Islamabad and Kabul
extended
the two-day ceasefire.

May conflict
with the neighbouring country.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an
attack
in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on 7 May, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “
Operation Bunyanum Marsoos
”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a
US-led push
helped broker a ceasefire.
Addressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul, COAS Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.”
Calling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms.
“The onus of ensuing escalations — one that may ultimately bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region and beyond — will squarely lie with India.”
“Should a fresh wave of hostilities be triggered, Pakistan would respond much beyond the expectations of the initiators,” COAS Munir warned.

“With diminishing distinctions between conflict and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India’s geographic warspace.
“The deeply hurting retributive military and economic losses inflicted will be much beyond the imagination and calculation of the perpetrators of chaos and instability,” he said.
“The battle-hardened army, which has fought for over two decades in the sub-conventional domain, has successfully displayed its capabilities in the
conventional domain
, as well as by delivering a swift and decisive blow to the adversary,” he said.
“Ever since the creation of Pakistan, the armed forces, with full support of the nation, have defended the external and internal frontiers of the country with unfailing resolve, conviction and pride.
“The most recent display of this spirit and resolve of the armed forces of Pakistan during
Marka-i-Haq
[and]
Operation Bunyan um Marsoos
has further strengthened the trust and confidence of the people of Pakistan in the competence and far-reaching capabilities of its armed forces by neutralising all threats with remarkable professionalism,” COAS Munir said, referring to the four-day May
conflict with India

“Downing advanced […]

He further said that “people of hues and colours, age, gender, ethnicity or creed, stood firm and tall like a wall of steel, leading to a renewed spirit of patriotism and national fervour, which prevails across the length and breadth of Pakistan”.
“Our collective success has re-energised and strengthened the proud and illustrious memories of our earlier successes. Pakistan once again came out victorious against a treacherous enemy marked by strategic blindness and naivety, and filled with hubris and rhetoric about its misguided hegemonic ambitions.
“India’s eagerness to adjudge culpability, aversion to
neutral investigations
and staking self-created evidence was indicative of politicisation of terrorism for vested interests of the ruling regime,” he added.
COAS Munir went on to say, “Pakistan, on the other hand, gained deep admiration of the people of Pakistan and the international community because of the legitimacy and the clear victory against a numerically superior adversary.
“Internally, it has further unified our nation and strengthened our resolve to defend against any threat, whether external or internal. It has reinforced confidence, particularly amongst the youth, that the armed forces of Pakistan are an essential element of national power and trusted with the responsibility to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state,” he said, assuring the nation that “we will not lose an inch of this sacred land”.
He commended the “valour of the people of Pakistan — every soldier, sailor, airman; the brave men, women and children and the elderly who laid their lives during these testing times; and the warriors who fought with the utmost conviction to defend their motherland at all costs”.
“The national leadership, the bureaucracy, scholars, scientists, media, academia, and most importantly, the youth deserve rich tribute for standing firmly against aggression,” the army chief added.
The army chief also spoke on Pakistan’s economy, hailing the government’s “relentless efforts” for relative stability and noting that positive economic indicators were attracting
investments
from across the world.
“The treasures hidden beneath our land for decades have started to surface as a silver lining for our bright future. Our vibrant youth, filled with talent, is making marvels in a multitude of domains.”
He also reiterated his
cautions
about social media, calling on people to be cognisant of threats “proliferating via digital media, populist anarchism and social subversion”.
“Unfortunately, in the post-truth era in which we live, perceptions bear more weight than reality and half-truths spread faster than facts. Your strength will lie in thinking critically and discerning fact from fiction,” he said, urging them to not become “tools of disinformation”.
Choose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS tells Kabul
The army chief also reiterated Pakistan’s stance that India “continues with state-sponsored terrorism”.
“Our adversary’s use of
Fitna al-Hind
and
Fitna al-Khawarij
as hired guns exposes its … hypocritical and heinous face to the world. Equally disconcerting is the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan,” he said.
Fitna al-Khawarij
is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and
Fitna al Hindustan
for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Urging the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS Munir urged the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”.
“Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”.
Speaking on occupied Kashmir, the army chief said India’s “oppression and widespread atrocities” in the valley will also come to an end. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s diplomatic and moral support for the Kashmiris’ freedom struggle till the resolution of the
dispute
in accordance with United Nations’ resolutions.

‘Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser’
During his address, COAS Munir noted that the world was witnessing “increased fragility and volatility, with a discernible shift towards violence as an instrument for attaining political objectives”.
“Amidst the chaos, Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser. Our relations with key global and regional powers, particularly Muslim countries, have further strengthened.”

The army chief stated that Pakistan had persistently “proven to be a key contributor toward peace and stability in the region and beyond”, highlighting Pakistan’s armed forces’ contributions to UN peacekeeping missions.
He also mentioned the
Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement
between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, terming it a “reinforcement and formalisation of Pakistan-Saudi brotherhood and a step towards ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East and South Asia”.
COAS Munir said Islamabad had also made “humble contributions towards peaceful steering of the negotiations with Iran”, adding that Pakistan’s relations with all Muslim countries were “thriving at an exponential” rate.
Hailing Pakistan’s historic “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership“ with China, the army chief also noted: “Re-energisational and strong and growing relations with the United States of America are an encouraging and welcome development.”
He lauded US President Donald Trump, saying that his “personal efforts and strategic leadership to bring peace to multiple conflict-prone areas of the world are really praiseworthy”.
“We will further nurture these relations with key global and regional players for the interest of peace, security, and development.”
COAS Munir also assailed Israel for its “blatant aggression, genocide and forced displacement waged upon Palestinians”.
Highlighting Pakistan’s “significant” role in the
diplomatic efforts
to secure the recent peace in Gaza, the field marshal said Pakistan expects the
ceasefire
to continue, followed by a smooth flow of humanitarian relief and the reconstruction of Gaza.
“Pakistan stands by its principled stance of indispensability of the two-state solution and the need for an independent, sovereign and viable State of Palestine based on pre-1967 war borders, with Al Quds Sharif as its capital,” he
reaffirmed
.
‘Enemies hell-bent upon driving a wedge between people, armed forces’
Addressing the cadets, he highlighted that they were being commissioned into “one of the finest armies across the world, which is second to none, respected by all and sundry”.
“This demands your absolute loyalty to [Pakistan, to the armed forces and the sacred task being entrusted onto your shoulders,” he underscored.
“Remember, our enemies are hell-bent upon driving a wedge between our people and the armed forces for their ulterior motives. Let me remind them that the bond between the people and the armed forces is unshakable,” the field marshal asserted.
He told the cadets that nothing should be more sacred than the safety and security of the people of Pakistan and no duty more binding than the defence of the country.
“The defence doctrine of Pakistan is predicated on credible deterrence and perpetual readiness, encompassing the full spectrum of capabilities. As a professional standing army, our conventional prowess through constant doctrinal and technological evolution has been optimised into a dynamic, integrated and adaptive force,” the army chief said.
Underscoring the need for intellectual readiness and technological advancements, COAS Munir told the cadets to “embrace innovation, life-long learning and adaptability to meet modern threats”.
At the outset of his address, the army chief extended his warm greetings and appreciation to the “immaculately turned-out gentlemen and lady cadets for the outstanding display of professionalism and discipline”.
He also expressed his compliments to the cadets from friendly countries of Malaysia, Nepal, Palestine, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Yemen, Mali, Maldives, and Nigeria for “successful completion of the formative training at this prestigious institution”.
“This is a moment of pride for you and all of us, reflective of the strong bond of military cooperation and international camaraderie,” COAS Munir said.
He highlighted that the PMA’s role “as a cornerstone of military excellence has always remained commendable, and the standards exhibited today are no less reflective of the same”.",2025-10-18,Dawn.com,2934,0.00028

upcoming three-match series.
According to a press release issued by the country’s cricket board on Saturday, “no decision has been made yet regarding the captaincy of the national team” for the series.
“.. head coach Mike Hesson has formally written to PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, recommending that a joint meeting of the Selection Committee and the Advisory Committee be convened to finalise the captain for the series,” the statement read, adding that the decision will be made as soon as Monday.
The PCB correspondence all but confirms Mohammad Rizwan’s ouster as the Pakistan ODI captain after leading the side to series wins in Australia, Zimbabwe and South Africa last year.
The wicket-keeper-batter, however, had disastrous outings in the ICC Champions Trophy earlier this year — with Pakistan failing to make it past the group stages — before losing away series to New Zealand and the West Indies.
Rizwan’s last ODI captaincy stint was in August against the West Indies — where the Caribbean side sealed a much-needed first ODI series win against Pakistan since 1991, after being swept aside 3-0 and 5-0 in Test and T20 series, respectively, by Australia earlier in the summer.
He was also quietly removed from Pakistan’s T20I captaincy during this time, with Salman Ali Agha taking over.
As per ongoing speculations and unconfirmed reports circulating on different media and social media platforms, Pakistan pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi is highly likely to replace Rizwan as Pakistan kick off their preparations for the 2027 World Cup with the South Africa series from November 4.
The Mohsin-led PCB regime, since February 2024, has made wholesale changes. It first removed Shaheen as captain to bring back Babar Azam as white-ball skipper in the first half of 2024.
Shaheen was previously appointed the T20I captain after Babar stepped down from captaincy in all formats following Pakistan’s disastrous campaign at the ODI World Cup 2023 in India.
Later, Babar, owing to the team’s poor performance in the T20 World Cup, decided to step down, after which Mohammad Rizwan was given the reins of white-ball team.",2025-10-18,Dawn.com,556,0.000102

Just like their 3-3 draw against Australia in their last round-robin match the other day, Pakistan were once again guilty of conceding early goals and despite having levelled the match at 2-2 in the 54th minute, they were eventually undone by Markham’s strike three minutes from time.
Great Britain, who had finished third in the round-robin table — one spot ahead of Pakistan, made a fast start and raced into a two-goal lead in the first quarter. Kaden Dreysey captalised on a penalty corner in the seventh minute before Michael Royden added the second in the 12th.
Captain Abdul Hannan Shahid’s field goal reduced the deficit in the 23rd but despite Sufyan Khan’s drag-flick expertise coming to the fore in the final quarter, it wasn’t enough for Pakistan.

Federal Minister for IT and Telecom Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Ambassador of Saudi Arabia to Pakistan Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki and others launched the initiative.
The AI Hub will help promote AI research, knowledge exchange, digital capacity building and co-creation of technology solutions to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the digital domain.
Minister Shaza Fatima said GO AI Hub was not a traditional agreement or a one-time transaction, but a sustainable digital platform enabling Pakistani professionals and entrepreneurs to engage directly with Saudi businesses without the need to travel or spend additional resources. “Through this hub, Pakistani freelancers can offer their services to Saudi companies remotely,” she said.
The minister said a major investment in data infrastructure would follow, supporting Pakistan’s growing digital ecosystem. She termed the project the first drop of many to come, and expressed confidence that Pakistan would soon witness billions of dollars in new investments.

Ms Khawaja added that Pakistan is now witnessing tangible results, with visible growth in investment, emerging technological talent, and expanding centers of artificial intelligence across the country. The minister expressed optimism that the 17 newly-signed
agreements
between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in the IT sector would further enhance cooperation.
The Saudi ambassador said that the company has already achieved success with a hub in Silicon Valley, USA, and is now bringing that vision to Pakistan.
“We look forward to more projects that will strengthen the strategic partnership between our two countries,” he added.
GO Group CEO Yahya bin Saleh Al-Mansour said the launch of the Hub in Islamabad, following the first established in Silicon Valley marked a new chapter in Saudi-Pakistan cooperation in artificial intelligence, digital innovation and ICT development. He added that the launch of the Hub in Islamabad signifies the company’s confidence in Pakistan’s digital ecosystem, talented youth, and innovation potential.
He added that the GO group will invest in data centres and cybersecurity infrastructure.
He invited Pakistani companies and institutions to engage with the GO AI Hub to explore AI-led opportunities in the Saudi market.
Also present on the occasion were National Coordinator SIFC Gen Sarfaraz Ahmed, PSEB CEO Abu Bakar and others.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949764/45-electric-buses-arrive-in-rawalpindi,45 electric buses arrive in Rawalpindi - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"RAWALPINDI: As many as 45 electric buses have arrived in the garrison city to operate on 10 routes.
However, the service is likely to start in November as the Punjab Masstransit Authority (PMA) and Regional Transport Authority (RTA) are completing final arrangements.
A total of
80
electric buses will operate on the roads of Rawalpindi, but in the initial phase, 45 buses have arrived for the city, while 15 have been dispatched to Gujar Khan. The Punjab Masstransit Authority will supervise the buses in Rawalpindi, whereas the Punjab Transport Company will manage those in Gujar Khan.
Earlier, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was scheduled to inaugurate the new transport system in the garrison city on October 15, but the ceremony was cancelled due to the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan
protest
in Islamabad.
Uzair Shah, General Manager (Operations) at the Punjab Masstransit Authority, told
Dawn
that the PMA had completed the arrangements for charging stations and the bus depot. “The buses will start operating next month,” he said.
l  Total of 80 buses to ply on roads in garrison city  l  Punjab Masstransit Authority, RTA finalise arrangements to start operations on 10 routes in November
He added that, under the law, the Punjab Masstransit Authority has the mandate to operate feeder buses for the Metro Bus Service. “All electric buses in Rawalpindi, Lahore and Multan will be managed by the PMA, while the Punjab Transport Company will oversee operations in other parts of the province,” he said.
According to Mr Shah, the fare for the new service will range between Rs20 and Rs25. “A total of 120 electric buses will run in Rawalpindi. In the first phase, 45 buses have arrived, and another 35 will arrive next month,” he added.
Regarding bus stops, he said shelters to protect passengers from rain and sun would be built by the Regional Transport Authority. “Construction will begin as soon as the buses hit the roads,” he said.
He added that the new electric buses would be linked with the Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metro Bus Service, providing a comfortable and affordable commuting option for citizens.
On the other hand, Regional Transport Authority (RTA) Secretary Asad Shirazi told
Dawn
that the RTA was assisting the PMA in executing the electric bus system in Rawalpindi.
“The main bus depot is being constructed at the old General Bus Service site on Peshawar Road,” he said.
“As the depot’s construction will take three to four months, we have temporarily developed a facility in Saddar on Adamjee Road at the General Bus Service stand. Some buses are also parked at the Metro Bus offices,” he added.
Mr Shirazi said the bus service would provide much-needed relief to the public. “Due to limited parking space, we will initially start with 45 buses in November,” he said.
He added that bus shelters would soon be constructed in collaboration with the Punjab Transport Department and the district administration. “The fare has been fixed, and monthly travel cards will also be introduced for regular passengers,” he said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949834/pms-adviser-warns-of-firm-response-to-any-attack,PM’s adviser warns of ‘firm response’ to any attack - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Saturday reiterated Islamabad’s stance that Pakistan will not be an aggressor, but warned that it will respond firmly to any attack.
“Our policy is very clear: Pakistan will not initiate aggression against any neighbouring country,” Mr Sanaullah told rep­orters. “But if anyone attacks us, we will not leave that unanswered.” He added that the response may exceed what some have referred to as “score zero six,” — a reference to Pakistan’s
downing
of six Indian aircraft in the May 2025 war.
Speaking about relations with Afgha­nistan, the adviser said Pakistan had consistently supported its neighbour and expressed deep regret over repeated incidents that have cost Pakistani lives. “We have always stood with Afghanistan. It pains us that we continue to suffer from that side,” he said. “We cannot keep carrying the coffins of our loved officers.”
Expresses regret over cross-border incidents from Afghanistan
Mr Sanaullah urged that a clear distinction be made between civilians and terrorists. “From now on, differentiate clearly between terrorists and ordinary people. If someone subscribes to an ideology of violence and terrorism and stands opposed to the state, there can be no dialogue with them,” he said.
Turning to allegations of external involvement in militant activity, he accused India of complicity. “India is involved — to such an extent that it didn’t even bother to deny it. They are culpable,” he told the media. At the same time, he dismissed any suggestion that New Delhi could mount a ground invasion, warning that Pakistan’s armed forces would respond robustly if provoked. “India does not have the capacity to overrun us. If it attempts anything, our armed forces will strike back,” he said.
On the domestic front, the adviser said Punjab was ready for local government elections and pledged that the process would extend “down to the streets and neighbourhoods,” giving ordinary citizens opportunities to participate in governance.
Responding to a question about a circulating video clip of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in which a small national flag was seen on his table while larger PTI and KP flags were displayed in the background, Mr Sanaullah said the footage had been edited. “There has been editing in the matter of the flags,” he said without elaborating.

• Red Zone area briefly opened to repatriate Afghan refugees
QUETTA: Calm prevailed on both sides of the Pak-Afghan border on Saturday after the extension of a ceasefire between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban forces, with no untoward incident reported from any area of the Chaman sector, where heavy
clashes
had erupted in the early hours of Tuesday last week.
Although the border crossings at Chaman and other entry points have closed for the past six days, Pakistan partially
reopened
the border in the Red Zone area to facilitate the repatriation of undocumented Afghan refugees.
“Under tight security, several hundred Afghan refugee families, including women and children, along with their belongings crossed into the Afghanistan over the past three days, a senior official said.
The border was opened for three days, while it remained closed for the other three due to intense fighting at four locations in the Chaman sector,” he added.
Following the
ceasefire
, no firing or attack was reported from either side. “Forces equipped with heavy weapons remain on high alert to respond to any situation,” the official said. The Friendship Gate at the Pak-Afghan border remains intact on the Pakistani side, while the Afghan Taliban damaged the gate on their side.
The Inspector General of Fron­t­ier Corps (North) Balochistan re­­c­e­ntly visited the Chaman border, where he was briefed by senior Frontier Corps commanders on the situation following the armed cla­shes. He also visited Pakistani border posts and the Friendship Gate.
The border, however, remains completely closed for all other purposes — including Afghan transit trade, imports, exports, and cross-border business — for the past six days.
Hundreds of loaded trucks and trailers carrying Afghan transit goods, fresh fruits, vegetables, and other commodities have been stranded on both sides of the border. “Around 140 trucks loaded with grapes and pomegranates are waiting in the Vesh Mandi area of Afghanistan to transport consignments to Quetta and other Pakistani cities,” officials said.
Similarly, over 500 loaded trucks carrying Afghan transit goods and import-export items have been stranded on the Pakistani side of the border in Chaman since the clashes began.
The business community engaged in cross-border trade has reported heavy financial losses, as perishable goods — particularly fruits and vegetables — are spoiling due to the prolonged closure.
Traders’ organisations, including the Chaman Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have expressed serious concern over the situation and urged authorities to reopen the border to prevent further economic losses.

• Justice Arbab Tahir to hear petition along with office’s objections on Monday
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court has raised objections to a
petition
filed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi seeking permission to meet PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala jail.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir is scheduled to hear the petition, along with the registrar office’s objections, on Monday.
The petition was submitted by KP Advocate General Shah Faisal through Advocate Ali Bukhari on behalf of the provincial chief minister. The petition argued that a meeting with the PTI founder was essential to discuss matters pertaining to provincial governance and the formation of a new cabinet.
However, the IHC registrar’s office objected to the maintainability of the plea, noting that the court had already adjudicated similar matters and had laid down a procedure for seeking permission to meet the PTI founder. The office questioned how a new petition could be filed without following the prescribed process.
The move came after CM Afridi was
denied
a meeting with PTI founder at Adiala jail. Following the refusal, the KP government approached the IHC, naming the federal and Punjab interior secretaries, the inspector general of Punjab Police, and the superintendent of Adiala jail as respondents.
According to the petition, the KP government had earlier submitted formal requests to the federal interior ministry and the Punjab home department to allow the meeting, but no approval was granted. The plea maintained that consultation with the PTI founder was “legally and ethically necessary” for the chief minister in connection with key administrative and political decisions, including cabinet formation.
Advocate General Shah Faisal, who verified his biometrics at the IHC under a special power of attorney, told reporters that CM Afridi had personally attempted to meet the PTI founder but was denied access despite having sought the prime minister’s permission. He added that the chief minister also intended to raise the matter before the Chief Justice of Pakistan on the administrative side and might approach the Supreme Court if necessary.
PTI leader and counsel Ali Bukhari said the ban on political meetings, imposed on November 26 last year, was contrary to the Pakistan Prisons Rules and violated visitation rights. He argued that even court directions regarding such rights were being disregarded, asserting that “meetings with inmates are a right, not a privilege.”
The petition requested the court to direct the jail authorities to immediately allow a meeting between the KP chief minister and the PTI founder, and to issue guidelines for future consultations as part of routine governance communication. The IHC will take up the petition, along with objections, for hearing on Monday.

Amid heightened tensions along the Pak-Afghan border, a high-level Pakistani delegation led by Asif travelled to Doha on Saturday for
talks
with Afghan Taliban officials, aimed at ending cross-border hostilities and addressing Pakistan’s security concerns.  Facilitated by Qatar, the talks followed days of clashes and Pakistani
strikes
on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, after a
48-hour ceasefire
was extended to allow negotiations.
In a post on X, the minister announced, “A ceasefire agreement has been finalised. The terrorist attacks from Afghanistan on Pakistan’s soil will cease immediately. Both neighbouring countries will respect each other’s territory,” adding that delegations will meet again in Istanbul on October 25 to discuss matters in detail.
“We are sincerely grateful to both brotherly countries, Qatar and Turkiye,” the minister said.
Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar welcomed the announcement, calling it a “step in the right direction.”
Taking to X, FM Dar said, “[I] welcome the agreement finalised late last night in Doha. It is the first step in the right direction.”
“Deeply appreciate the constructive role played by brotherly Qatar and Turkiye,’ he added.
Dar expressed hope for the establishment of a “concrete and verifiable monitoring mechanism” to tackle terrorism “emanating from Afghan soil” in the upcoming Istanbul meeting.
He stressed that “it is important to put all efforts in place to prevent any further loss of lives.”
Separately, the spokesperson for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, Zabiullah Mujahid, in a statement issued on Sunday, said: “Negotiations between representatives of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, held in Qatar, have concluded with the signing of a bilateral agreement.”
“Under the terms of the agreement, both sides reaffirm their commitment to peace, mutual respect, and the maintenance of strong and constructive [neighbourly] relations,” the statement added.
As per the statement, both countries mutually agreed that “neither country will undertake any hostile actions against the other, nor will they support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan.”
“Both sides will refrain from targeting each other’s security forces, civilians, or critical infrastructure,” it added.
Underscoring commitment towards diplomacy, the statement said: “Both sides are committed to resolving issues and disputes through dialogue”, detailing that “a comprehensive and meaningful ceasefire has been mutually agreed upon.”
“In the future, a mechanism will be established, under the mediation of intermediary countries, to review bilateral claims and ensure the effective implementation of this agreement,” it said.
The spokesperson also extended appreciation to Qatar and Turkiye for their role in facilitating the agreement.
In a subsequent post, he referred to the phrase “nor will they support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan” in his earlier statement. Mujahid clarified that it had been the the permanent position of  the Islamic Emirate that “it does not allow the use of Afghan territory against any other country”.
“It (The Islamic Emirate) does not support any attack against anyone and has always emphasised this stance,” he added.
Earlier, a post on the X account of
PTV News
, citing the Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had also confirmed the development.
“During the talks, both countries not only agreed on an immediate ceasefire but also decided to establish a permanent mechanism for bilateral peace and stability,” the post said.
The post further noted that both countries will hold follow-up meetings in the coming days to ensure the implementation and sustained continuity of the ceasefire.
“These measures will prove beneficial in promoting security and stability in both Pakistan and Afghanistan,” it said.
According to the post, the negotiations, hosted by the State of Qatar with Turkiye acting as mediator, continued for 13 hours.
For its part, Qatar also uploaded a statement on X announcing the ceasefire. In the statement by the foreign ministry, Qatar expressed the hope that “this important step will contribute to ending tensions on the border between the two brotherly countries and form a solid foundation for sustainable peace in the region”.
However, the statement on the development on the foreign ministry’s website omitted the word “border” from this sentence.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office did not immediately comment on the difference in the statements.
Meanwhile, many
saw
the omission of the word border from the statement as a diplomatic victory for the Afghan Taliban, who have long refused to recognise the Durand Line as the legitimate border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
On Saturday, as talks were underway between the two sides, Pakistan had reiterated that it did not seek escalation. However, it urged the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities, a statement from the FO had
said
.
“Pakistan appreciates the mediation efforts of Qatar and hopes these discussions contribute to peace and stability in the region,“ it had added.
Cross-border escalation
On the night of October 11, Afghan forces launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistani border posts, sparking a series of
clashes
that left 23 Pakistani soldiers martyred and over 200 Taliban and affiliated militants dead, according to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The Pakistan military responded with precision strikes inside Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul, targeting militant camps and border positions, while urging Kabul to act against terrorist groups operating from its soil.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the border attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting
air strikes
in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has
neither confirmed nor denied
.
Clashes broke out again on Tuesday (Oct.14), with the Afghan Taliban and
Fitna al Khawarij
exchanging
fire with Pakistan troops at the Kurram border. Pakistan followed this on Wednesday by launching “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul.
Fitna al Khawarij
is a term the state uses to refer to the terrorists affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The FO on Wednesday announced that a
temporary ceasefire
had been agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid the recent border hostilities. Later on Friday, the ceasefire was
extended
, according to a senior diplomatic source.
Additionally, Pakistan again
targeted
terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan that same day. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a
military installation
in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire.
Deteriorating ties
Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have remained strained since 2023, with Pakistan repeatedly
raising concerns
over the
use of Afghan soil
by militants carrying out cross-border attacks. The security situation has deteriorated further in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan following the outlawed TTP’s decision to
end its ceasefire
with Islamabad in November 2022.
While the two sides have attempted to hold dialogue from time to time, tensions have persisted.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949852/measured-response,Measured response - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE government’s decision to
shut down
all Afghan refugee camps and deny any further extension for their stay marks a new phase in a complex and painful chapter of Pakistan’s history.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s directive for the “dignified repatriation” of Afghan nationals — with more exit points to be established along the border — underscores Islamabad’s desire to address economic and security pressures.
Yet, this moment also demands empathy, restraint and a humane approach that matches the spirit of generosity Pakistan has displayed for over four decades. Since 1979, Pakistan has hosted one of the world’s largest refugee populations — at times sheltering more than 3m Afghans — despite its own economic hardships and political turmoil.
This act of hospitality has earned the country considerable goodwill and global respect. But the current policy, which explicitly links repatriation to Kabul’s failure to curb cross-border militancy, risks blurring the line between legitimate security concerns and humanitarian obligations. Refugees cannot be treated as extensions of a government from which many have fled in fear or desperation.
The Taliban’s
return
to power in 2021 prompted a new wave of displacement, with many Afghans escaping persecution, repression, and poverty. For such individuals, forced or abrupt repatriation could mean exposure to grave danger and renewed trauma.
The prime minister has rightly spoken of ensuring a “dignified and humane” process, with care for women, children, minorities and the elderly. But ensuring that this comes into practice requires international oversight, logistical support, and close coordination with the UNHCR, aid partners, and humanitarian agencies to ensure that returnees have safety, shelter, and viable livelihood options on arrival.
There is also a practical dimension. Many Afghans — some born and raised entirely in Pakistan — have integrated into local communities, contributing to labour markets, small businesses, education, and cultural life. Displacement for them is not a return but an uprooting that will reshape countless lives and neighbourhoods. A more nuanced approach is needed: those with legal status or deep social ties should be offered regularisation pathways, while repatriation for others must proceed when conditions across the border are stable and safe.
Pakistan’s frustration with Kabul over security issues is understandable, but refugee policy must not become an instrument of political signalling or retaliation. Instead, Islamabad should frame its approach as part of a larger humanitarian effort, seeking global funding and cooperation for reintegration programmes.
The world owes Pakistan support for shouldering this burden for so long. That support must now translate into meaningful aid, sustained diplomatic engagement, and a shared commitment to justice, dignity, and long-term stability. As the government proceeds, it must ensure that compassion remains its guiding principle. Dignity in repatriation cannot exist without humanity in intent.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949853/talibans-new-ploy,Taliban’s new ploy - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE Afghan Taliban regime is living under an illusion. Visiting India, its interim foreign minister recently stated that Afghanistan had defeated the British, the Soviets and the Americans. No, they had not. The Afghan rulers of the time were decisively defeated in the second Anglo-Afghan war (1878-80) by the British, enabling the latter to effectively make Afghanistan a buffer zone in the Great Game between the Raj and the Russian empire. Abdul Rahman Khan accepted the Durand Line as the border with British India, which was endorsed by subsequent Afghan rulers. As for the Soviets, it was the concerted effort by the US and Pakistan that pushed them out and rescued the Afghan people in the 1980s. America’s presence in Afghanistan since 2001 also ended only when the US itself decided to exit in August 2021 because of American public opinion turning against distant wars and the strategic depth the Taliban had received in Pakistan.
For over four years now, the world has expected the Taliban to honour their commitments under the 2020 Doha peace accord with the US. However, they have violated all three promises: forming a true representative government, respecting women’s rights, and not allowing terrorist entities on Afghan soil.
With Pakistan, the Taliban have adopted a particularly hostile attitude, having lately embarked upon a two-pronged manoeuvre. The first prong is teaming up with India to not only benefit from Indian investments in healthcare, education and infrastructure, but to also doubly squeeze Pakistan under the mistaken belief that Pakistan’s enemy is their friend. For its part, India, which has severely criticised Taliban in the past, has reversed its policy in order to leverage the Taliban against Pakistan, just as the Taliban are leveraging it against Pakistan. India hopes to wean the Taliban further away from Pakistan and even China.
The second prong is an upsurge in the Taliban’s kinetic aggression to destabilise the Pak-Afghan border (Oct 11-12, 2025) while ignoring Pakistan’s consistent protests against the Taliban’s support to the TTP (and other anti-Pakistan elements) who have killed children and other innocent civilians in Pakistan. For now, Pakistan has repulsed the assaults and inflicted heavy losses on the Taliban forces and their TTP associates. However, it is evident that the Taliban won’t heed Pakistan’s advice to not allow terrorist elements on their soil. Instead, the Afghan leadership tends to shift the burden of any action to Pakistan, arguing that these terrorists should be handled inside this country. The Taliban media is also spreading disinformation, taking a leaf out of the Indian media’s playbook.
Why are the Taliban inimical towards Pakistan?
Why are the Taliban so ungrateful and inimical towards Pakistan? It appears that they are trying to be nationalist in order to garner support from the wider Afghan society. Perhaps they wish to give the impression that they aren’t under Pakistan’s influence. They are hosting the TTP probably as a leverage against Pakistan. In doing all this, they are overestimating their power potential, and may be in for a rude shock. It would be prudent for them not to underestimate Pakistan’s resolve to defend its borders and defeat Taliban-backed terrorists.
How should Pakistan deal with the Taliban? Several steps can be considered in the immediate term: One, Pakistan should maintain its robust defence at the borders with Afghanistan (and India). Only strength can deter aggression. Two, it should send a clear message to Kabul that the doors for dialogue are open, provided the Taliban firmly commit to ending their support to the TTP. If they do not commit to that, then kinetic options wou­ld remain on the table. Three, Paki­s­tan must keep up the pressure on the Taliban through diplomatic outreach to Saudi Arabia (now a partner in mutual defence), China, Russia, Iran, the Central Asian Republics, Turkiye, the UAE and America. Given the Taliban’s past association with Al Qaeda, the global community would not want to see the Taliban hosting terrorist entities again. Pakistan should also register its complaints in the UN under the UNSCR 1988 (1267) sanctions regime.
In the medium term, Pakistan should develop a nationwide consensus on a review of its previously generous policies regarding Afghan refugees, scholarships for Afghan students, special desks in its hospitals for Afghans, collecting custom duties on transit trade through Pakistani ports, and media outreach to Afghan society. Experts could be invited to suggest doable measures. In the long term, an effort could be mounted to win the hearts and minds of our nationals living in the erstwhile Fata region bordering Afghanistan through development work. They are the first line of defence against terrorism from Afghanistan.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1949856/another-doha-pact,Another Doha pact - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THERE is little optimism or even enthusiasm surrounding the post-ceasefire talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan taking place in Doha. Yet, it would be unwise to dismiss them outright. If one assesses the potential pragmatically, these discussions could evolve into a ‘Doha pact’ of their own, echoing the 2021
agreement
between the Taliban and the US that altered the regional geopolitical landscape.
Facilitated by Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the Taliban have agreed to sit down with their Pakistani counterparts in Doha to discuss bilateral relations and the possible extension of the ceasefire, which was initially agreed upon for just 48 hours after recent border clashes between the two countries.
Should the two sides reach an understanding akin to the earlier Doha accord, where the Taliban provide verifiable guarantees that the TTP and other Afghan-based militants will not operate against Pakistan, it could prove transformative. Such an agreement would not only redefine the troubled bilateral relationship but could also reshape the regional landscape. The prospects for transnational connectivity, trade and mega infrastructure projects linking Central and South Asia would expand dramatically, offering tangible improvements to the lives of millions across the region.
However, the Taliban leadership does not have such a vision, and the major problem with the Taliban leadership lies in its deeply conventional mindset in both political and religious thinking. This rigidity stems mainly from their madressah education, whether in Pakistan or Afghanistan. Most of their leaders, whether graduates or dropouts, share the same worldview, cutting across all factions and shades of leadership, from the so-called ‘moderates’ like Abbas Stanikzai to the Haqqanis and hardliners such as Mullah Abdul Hakim Haqqani.
The Taliban perceive the world as something that must learn to accommodate them.
They perceive the world as something that must learn to accommodate them or strive to understand them, while they see no reason to change themselves. They consider themselves victorious, having defeated great powers, and believe the world should now deal with them on their terms. Consequently, they show little willingness to reconsider their orthodox, religiously driven policies of moral policing or their severe restrictions on women and other vulnerable segments of society, despite appeals from respected religious scholars across the Islamic world.
Their mindset is incompatible with evolving global norms, and even with the political realities of authoritarian yet relatively modern Muslim societies. Why, then, should others be expected to give them time or understand their so-called compulsions, which they often cite when discussing terrorism-related issues with Pakistan and neighbouring countries? Why should Pakistan and others continue to listen to them and at what cost? Must Pakistan continue to bleed at the hands of the TTP and other militant groups while the Taliban offer themselves as mediators between the state and terrorists?
In contrast, when militant groups rooted in Al Qaeda and Daesh captured parts of Syria, their behaviour, both internally and in their engagement with the world, was notably different. One understands that Afghanistan is not Syria. Syria, despite its devastation, is attempting to rebuild through a fragile but ongoing national consensus and is showing a willingness to align, at least partially, with regional and global norms. The Taliban, by comparison, have failed to foster any such consensus at home.
Unlike in Syria, where elements of the leadership remain visible, reachable, and at times open to dialogue with world powers, including the US and Russia, the Taliban’s supreme leader, Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, remains hidden. The reasons for his seclusion are unclear. Officially, it is attributed to ‘security concerns’, but these explanations no longer hold much weight. What is he afraid of? Lack of confidence, fear of dissent, or simply an inability to step out of a wartime mindset? No one truly knows who is making decisions on his behalf. The Taliban’s internal communications are riddled with contradictions, and myths continue to swirl around their leadership.
One recent example illustrates this opacity and confusion. Reports emerged that Mullah Hibatullah had ordered an internet
shutdown
across Afghanistan, citing concerns that WhatsApp and other social media apps were spreading obscenity, vulgarity, and music. Yet, just a few days later, he reportedly asked an aide why he was no longer receiving WhatsApp messages. When informed that the services had been suspended on his own orders, he reluctantly directed that internet access be restored.
Such incidents, while almost absurd on the surface, reveal a deeper problem within the Taliban’s governance structure — a leadership trapped between ideological rigidity and the demands of a connected, modern world.
The Taliban leadership is neither innovative nor forward-looking in shaping better relations with its neighbours, particularly Pakistan and China, despite the long-term advantages such engagement could bring. Instead, they continue to rely on the old Afghan template of suspicion and defiance towards Pakistan, a posture that frustrates Islamabad even more than the persistent terrorist threat the country faces daily.
India, fully aware of these sensitivities, has been quick to exploit the Taliban’s posture to its advantage, skilfully playing on Pakistan’s insecurities. For the Taliban, this dynamic serves as a convenient balancing act, using the Indian card to counter Pakistan’s pressure on issues of terrorism and border security-related affairs.
In Doha, the Taliban are unlikely to change. Neither Qatar nor Saudi Arabia possess the leverage to compel them to abandon their closest militant ally, the TTP. China, too, has failed to persuade them on this issue, and it remains unclear what strategy the Gulf mediators can employ to convince the Taliban to address Pakistan’s concerns about cross-border terrorism seriously. The likelihood is that the Taliban will continue to deny responsibility, insisting that the TTP problem is an ‘internal matter’ for Pakistan and offering, at best, vague proposals for dialogue.
To avoid embarrassing their hosts, the ceasefire between Afghanistan and Pakistan may be extended for a few weeks. But the real solution does not lie in diplomatic gestures or temporary truces. It lies in the Taliban’s willingness to completely sever ties with all forms of terrorism, something they had promised to the US in the original Doha Agreement, and a commitment they may now be compelled to make once again, this time to Pakistan.

Hyperspectral imaging is a type of advanced camera technology used in satellites to study the Earth and space, according to a study published in the Journal of Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience.
Unlike regular satellite cameras that capture only a few colours (like red, green, and blue), hyperspectral cameras capture hundreds of very narrow colour bands. This means they can detect tiny differences in light that the human eye, or even normal satellites, can’t see.
In a statement issued today, Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said, “The nation’s space agency today announced a breakthrough achievement with the successful launch of Pakistan’s first Hyperspectral Satellite (HS-1) from China.”
View this post on Instagram
Detailing the function of the satellite, the statement said, “HS-1 satellite is engineered to capture ultra-precise hyperspectral imagery across hundreds of narrow spectral bands, offering unprecedented resolution for the analysis of land, vegetation, water, and urban features.”
“The cutting-edge technology is set to fundamentally transform Pakistan’s capacity in precision agriculture, rigorous environmental monitoring, urban planning, and proactive disaster management,” it said.
“HS-1 will empower the nation to precisely map crop vitality, soil moisture, and water quality, while rigorously tracking deforestation, pollution, and glacial melt.”
It added that the satellite will “enhance early warning systems and post-disaster assessments for catastrophic events like floods and landslides, especially across the northern regions”.
Per the agency, the satellite is also expected to aid “development initiatives such as CPEC by preemptively identifying geo-hazard risks and guiding sustainable infrastructure development”.
Chairman Suparco, Muhammad Yousaf Khan, “expressed profound gratitude for the Government of Pakistan’s support in bringing this pivotal national project to fruition”, the statement quoted him as saying.
“The data from the Hyperspectral Satellite is poised to revolutionise agricultural productivity, bolster climate resilience, and enable optimised management of the country’s vital natural resources.”
Underscoring the long-standing partnership between Pakistan and China in space science, the space agency continued: “The mission reflects the ever-growing strategic partnership and deep-rooted friendship between the two nations, who continue to cooperate in advancing peaceful space exploration and harnessing its benefits for socioeconomic development.”
“HS-1’s successful integration into Pakistan’s expanding space fleet marks a decisive step toward solidifying space technology excellence and reinforces Suparco’s vital role in driving national socioeconomic growth through innovative space applications.”
According to the press release, Project Director HS-1 Mushtaque Hussain Soomro stressed that the satellite “signals a definitive leap in Pakistan’s ambitious space roadmap, positioning the nation as an emerging leader in space technology for sustainable development”.
He also hailed the mission team’s collective dedication and technical brilliance, the statement said.
In a statement from his office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his appreciation for Pakistani engineers and scientists for the successful launch.
“The cooperation between Pakistan and China in space research, like in other sectors, is exemplary and of key importance,” the PM was quoted as saying. “We are grateful to our great and long-standing friend and strategic partner, China, for this exemplary collaboration.
“The hearts of Pakistanis beat with the Chinese people and leadership,” he added.
According to the statement,  the satellite will help Pakistan research environmental changes and geographical variations.
“This progress will prove to be an important milestone in combating the harmful effects of climate change,” PM Shehbaz said. “The satellite will significantly increase national capabilities in areas such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning and disaster management.”
Separately, in a statement issued today, the foreign office termed the development a major milestone and called it “a pivotal step forward in Pakistan’s space programme.”
FO said that the launch “reaffirms Suparco’s commitment to leveraging space technology for national development.”
It also “highlights the long-standing collaboration between Pakistan and China in the peaceful exploration of space and its application for socioeconomic progress.”
“Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar commended the scientists/technical teams from Pakistan and China working on HS-1 for their commitment, professional excellence and exemplary cooperation,” the statement said.
On October 15, Suparco
announced
the upcoming launch of the HS-1 satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in China.
Last month, a senior official from Suparco said the agency was
integrating
space-based applications into its disaster risk management framework, “paving a path anchored in science and international collaboration to better prepare for natural calamities”.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). Any IQAir AQI ranking above 150 is considered “unhealthy” and above 200 is considered “very unhealthy”.
The AQI
reading
for Lahore stood at a very unhealthy 189; it was just beaten by Delhi, which registered a reading of 212 around 7:30pm.
Additionally, levels of the pollutant PM2.5 were
measured
at 109 microgrammes per cubic metre of air (μg/m³), 21.8 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s annual PM2.5 guidelines.
PM2.5 particles are floating particulate matter in the air measuring 2.5 micrometres in diameter or less, according to IQAir. PM2.5 is so small that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream upon inhalation.
IQAir recommended on its website that residents in Lahore avoid outdoor exercise, run air purifiers and prioritise wearing masks. It also recommended closing all windows to avoid dirty air from outdoors.
Lahore has historically dealt with smog and poor air quality in the winter months.
Around this time
last year
, the air quality in Lahore was recorded at 394 amid the smog crisis, primarily fuelled by crop residue burning and industrial emissions. The smog caused widespread health issues among residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation and skin infections.
To combat smog this year, the Punjab government has introduced ‘
smog guns
’, with Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb stating that they were already in use across Lahore.
“Through this modern machine, tiny droplets of water are sprayed into the air to combat smog,“ she explained. “The water mist helps clean pollution and dust particles present in the atmosphere. This modern machinery is also being used in countries like China, India, and others to reduce smog.”",2025-10-19,Dawn.com,515,9.9e-05

• 95 bank accounts identified; parleys continue over fate of seminaries administered by the group
LAHORE: Authorities in Punjab claim to have traced the whereabouts of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas, saying the absconding leaders fled to Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) after the
Muridke crackdown
.
A senior official told
Dawn
that law enforcers had shared this information with AJK authorities and sought their help to nab the TLP leaders. The development follows speculation — fuelled by TLP circles — that their party chief was in custody.
The official said following the crackdown, several teams comprising senior officers from Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies had been tasked with tracking down the TLP chief and his brother.
He said Saad Rizvi and his brother were first spotted walking away from the protest camp in Muridke, and then fleeing on a motorbike.
At that time, an emergency message was circulated among the LEAs that a motorcycle rider carrying the TLP chief and his brother had moved towards nearby streets.
The three suspects, however, managed to dodge law enforcement personnel, any many rumours started to surface on social media regarding possible injury to them.
The officer said the special teams eventually traced the last location of the TLP leaders somewhere in AJK and sought the regional government’s help for their arrest.
It may be recalled that the Punjab government has
formally sought the proscription of TLP
and has sent a summary in this regard to the federal government.
Meanwhile, the Federal Inves­tigation Agency also traced nearly 95 bank accounts operated by the TLP chief, Saad Rizvi, the official said.
Of them, 15 were interest-bearing accounts, and the FIA was trying to get more details from the relevant banks to check the transactions made by the TLP chief, he added.
TLP seminaries
As a part of a wider crackdown on the radical outfit, the Punjab government also identified 61 seminaries run by the TLP across the province. The issue of these seminaries also came up during a meeting of Sunni clerics with the provincial authorities, as both sides discussed proposals about the fate of these institutions.
During the meeting, two proposals came under discussion to decide the future of these seminaries. It was suggested in the meeting that these seminaries be given under the administrative control of the Punjab Auqaf Department — this suggestion, however, was opposed by the majority of the participants who feared such a move would aggravate the situation. They said this action may create controversies in the future, particularly due to the huge financial expenses.
The second proposal pertained to handing over these seminaries to the moderate Sunni clerics – a move deemed workable. However, the authorities said in such a case, the clerics would run the TLP seminaries without the element of ‘militancy’. But a final decision on the fate of these seminaries is yet to be taken.
Meanwhile, the Multan district administration sealed 10 TLP seminaries and handed several over to the Auqaf department in line with the Punjab government’s orders. These seminaries were located in Multan, Shujabad, and Basti Malook.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950063/literary-notes-putting-urdu-criticism-on-world-literary-map,literary notes: Putting Urdu criticism on world literary map - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"POSTCOLONIAL discourse is not anything new: back in 1978 with the publication of Edward Said’s book Orientalism the postcolonial studies had emerged on the academic scene with a bang. But in Pakistan it was something almost unheard of till the late 1990s. Though a few Urdu books on critical theories did discuss the impact of colonial and imperial policies on Urdu language and literature — especially some progressive writers and critics with a traditionalist bent of mind had criticised the exploitative nature of the colonial policies — no detailed and organised study on the topic existed in Urdu.
Dr Nasir Abbas Nayyar began writing research papers in Urdu on postcolonialism and his book Maba’d Nauabadiyaat: Urdu Ke Tanazur Mein, first published in 2013, was a pioneering effort in the field. The book, adorned with proper references, opened up the discourse to a readership that did not have direct access to the works published in English on the issues related to postcolonial studies. Nayyar’s book crystalised the notion that postcolonial discourse was not merely a literary or critical one but it was also a theoretical framework to understand the political, historical and cultural impact of colonialism. Nayyar has first presented the boundaries and distinctions of postcolonialism, then explained the knowledge and power in colonial context. He analyses Europe’s grand narrative and linguistic imperialism in the next chapters, explaining contributions of William Jones and John Gilchrist. ‘Racism and White Aesthetics’ is the chapter added in the new edition.
While criticising the western colonial powers and presenting some historical facts with an explanation from the point of view of the colonised, Nayyar is unemotional, substantiating his argument with references and original texts both from Urdu and English. Presenting excerpts from works by some colonial writers, such as, Rudyard Kipling and John Gilchrist, Nayyar proves the racism was the most lethal weapon of the colonialists. Orientalists worked on eastern languages and literatures to justify and reinforce colonialism and, proves Nayyar, postcolonialism is a kind of ideological response to the theory and practice of colonialism, thus presenting the postcolonial identity of the colonised.
But the academic circles in the West were — and perhaps still are — generally, and naturally, unaware of the works carried out in Urdu on postcolonial perspective. Dr Omair Ahmed Khan, an educator and scholar of comparative literatures, came to know about some academic work-in-progress at a European university and was dismayed to note that the general perception there was that there was no such thing as a postcolonial study in Urdu. Having read Urdu literature vastly as well as Nayyar’s works, he decided to translate Nayyar’s book into English. So with permissions, Omair Khan began rendering the new edition of Nayyar’s Urdu work, published by Sang-i-Meel Publications in 2024, into English. Sang-i-Meel has just published the English translation, too.
Translation is a tricky business as it demands faithfulness to the original text but also needs a lucidity and accessibility, which is sometimes lost in translation, as idiomatic expressions or peculiarities of a language may cloud the meaning for a reader from a different linguistic and cultural background. Titled Postcolonial Perspectives in Urdu Literature, Omair Khan’s English translation of Nayyar’s Urdu book is a good example of a faithful translation taking care of some semantic issues that translators often confront with. Through this translation, Omair Khan has introduced postcolonial issues discussed in Urdu as well as Urdu criticism’s modern viewpoint to a greater readership since English is not only the preferred medium of the academia worldwide but it has also become the virtual global lingua franca. Translating an essential Urdu work on postcolonialism into English is in fact putting Pakistan and its literary and academic works on world literary map.

The minister assurance came while presiding over a meeting to address the bottlenecks faced by meat exporters in exporting meat to Malaysia.
The meeting was attended by secretary of industries and production, Saif Anjum, along with representatives from both the public and private sectors.
The meeting discussed issues and recommendations related to meat exports to Malaysia. Exp­orters identified main challenges including feed quality, livestock breed, high production costs, lack of cold chain facilities, limited banking support, and documentation hurdles.
Exporters emphasised that the banking sector is not providing adequate support, forcing them to make cash payments in cattle markets. They also highlighted the absence of cold storage facilities at airports, compelling them to store meat in vehicles.
Representative of meat exporters pointed out that while India exports meat at USD 3.5 per kilogramme, Pakistan’s export cost stands at USD 5 per kilogramme. They further said that Pakistan currently exports meat to Taji­kistan at the same rate. The minister acknowledged the concerns raised by exporters and affirmed that Pakistani meat is of superior quality and capable of competing in international markets.

‘Pakistan Country Opinion Survey for Pakistan’
, commissioned by the World Bank.
The survey found that support for climate change initiatives increased from 5 per cent in fiscal year 2021 to 34pc in fiscal year 2025. Similarly, support for water and sanitation rose from 9pc to 35pc in the same period.
While the World Bank Group’s (WBG) work in pandemic preparedness, gender equity, and disaster risk management received the highest effectiveness ratings, the overall perception of its support has decreased significantly since 2021 in other areas, especially for governance, education, and water and sanitation.
In qualitative comments, respondents called for the WBG to deepen its local engagement in Pakistan, “moving beyond federal-level interactions to more meaningful collaboration at the grassroots, provincial, and community levels to better understand local needs and ensure effective implementation”.
Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s support have declined in key sectors
The survey showed that financial resources were considered the WBG’s greatest value to Pakistan at 48pc, followed by knowledge products (33pc), technical assistance (32pc), and capacity development (24pc).
While ratings for many key performance indicators remained largely consistent with 2021 findings, the survey noted that the only rating to show a significant improvement was the perception of the WBG’s effectiveness in achieving development results in Pakistan.
More than half of respondents felt that the WBG has strengthened its work in improving people’s lives (52pc) and in being easy to work with (51pc).
Additionally, just under half believed the Bank has somewhat or significantly improved the technical quality of WBG-supported projects and partnered with others to increase development finance (49 per cent and 48 per cent, respectively).
A government institution respondent stated that “capacity building of the local stakeholders and impact assessment of the projects should be necessary in the project design”.
A parliamentarian suggested the WBG “develop people-to-people contact, and engage civil society along with the government for better results of project implementation.” The parliamentarian added that Parliament and local body members “must be taken in decision and implementation of projects”.
Collaboration with the national government received the highest ratings this year, but this perception has decreased significantly since fiscal year 2021. At the same time, perceptions of effective collaboration with civil society have improved significantly.
However, the group’s collaboration with the parliament and local government received relatively lower ratings, with stakeholders from the office of a parliamentarian giving some of the lowest ratings.
Respondents were most familiar with the WBG’s and the United Nations’ work among development institutions. The survey found the WBG to be one of the most trusted institutions in Pakistan, alongside the UN and the Asian Development Bank.
Significant differences emerged in how various groups perceive the WBG. Respondents from bilateral agencies and government institutions were more positive about WBG staff accessibility than those from the offices of parliamentarians, civil society, and academia. Respondents from local government organisations tended to be more critical of the WBG’s work.
The Country Opinion Surveys, which are part of the World Bank Group’s programme series, explore stakeholder opinions on the economy, future priorities, and perceptions of the WBG’s effectiveness, relevance, and ability to influence the development agenda.

• KP Assembly to convene today after CM meets speaker to discuss ‘political situation’
PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday announced a jirga, to be held in his hometown of Bara in the Khyber district, on Saturday (Oct 25) to establish enduring peace in the restive province and resist decisions made without the input of residents.
In a tweet, the newly elected CM reiterated that no one would be allowed to impose decisions made behind ‘closed doors’. The CM said that the KP residents would decide their future and warned of vetoing any unilateral decisions regarding the restive province. “People of KP will decide about their lives and future,” CM Afridi said in a tweet.
The PTI has consistently opposed plans to conduct anti-terrorism operations across the province, with its incarcerated founder Imran Khan in August telling then-CM Ali Amin Gandapur not to allow the Centre to conduct any military operations. Mr Khan had made a similar demand last month and apparently CM Afridi replaced Mr Gandapur for the same reason. In his maiden speech last week, the CM had said a military offensive was not a solution to militancy.
Against this backdrop, CM Afridi said the provincial government stood by the ideology of Imran Khan and the interests of the KP residents. He said a peace jirga would be held in Bara on Saturday, which would be attended by local elders from Khyber.
When contacted, former cabinet member Mena Khan Afridi said the CM had made it clear that decisions made behind closed doors would not be implemented anymore and that was the reason he wanted to seek public opinion through a jirga.
“Mostly, these are the tribesmen belonging to the merged districts, who have been facing the challenge (of militancy) more than those living in settled districts. He (the CM) himself is a tribesman and wants to put this case before the tribesman,” the lawmaker said. Mr Mena Khan Afridi said that people from Khyber would participate in the jirga, but anyone from any other merged district can participate.
In the past, similar jirgas had been convened by ex-CM Gandapur, who held consultative meetings with public representatives and elders from all merged districts, wherein the participants suggested engaging with the interim Afghan government and holding talks for regional stability.
A similar gathering was organised by PTI’s student and youth wing on September 12, where participants, from across the province, had demanded negotiations with the interim Afghan government for regional peace, involving tribal elders. The participants had called for the immediate withdrawal of all the cases filed against those who raised their voices against terrorism.
“We have made several demands in the declaration. Some issues fall within the domain of the federal government, while some are related to the provincial government. Whoever does it, we want our issues resolved,” Insaf Youth Wing’s regional president Sajjad Mohmand said.
KP Assembly session
Meanwhile, KP Speaker Babar Saleem Swati issued a notification for the assembly session at 2pm today instead of on October 25. A statement issued from Mr Swati’s office read that the decision was taken following a meeting between Mr Afridi and Mr Swati held at the speaker’s house.
“The meeting involved a detailed discussion on the current political situation and parliamentary matters of the province. The chief minister proposed convening an assembly session, and the speaker, after consultation, agreed to summon the session,” the statement read.

• Calls for ‘National Agriculture Restoration Policy’
ISLAMABAD: The PTI’s Kisaan Wing (PTI-KW) has urged the federal and provincial governments to prioritise the restoration of agriculture sector, which suffered large-scale devastation due to the recent floods across the country, calling for the immediate formulation of a ‘National Agriculture Restoration Policy’.
This demand was made through a unanimous resolution passed at the PTI-KW meeting held on Sunday. The meeting was chaired by PTI-KW Organiser and MNA Sheikh Waqqas Akram, and attended by Central Information Secretary Khalid Nawaz Sadhraich, PTI Kisan Wing Punjab President Major (R) Ghulam Sarwar, General Secretary Muhammad Ijaz Shafi, MNA Khurram Shahzad Virk and a number of office bearers from various farmers’ organisations.
Briefing the media after the meeting, PTI-KW spokesperson Khalid Nawaz Sadhraich expressed deep concerns over the authorities’ handling of the post-flood situation. He said the recent floods caused a large-scale destruction across the country, resulting in estimated losses exceeding Rs822 billion. “The federal government’s preliminary flood damage assessment report admitted this loss, but the actual losses could be even higher as a detailed post-disaster assessment is still underway”, he added.
Mr Sadhraich said the meeting expressed dissatisfaction over the government’s post-flood relief and rehabilitation measures, terming them “highly disappointing” for the affected people, particularly farmers. He noted the initial estimates put the losses in agriculture sector alone at around Rs430 billion, excluding livestock and damage to the canal system.
“With the Rabi season fast approaching, helpless farmers have no access to basic inputs for sowing their crops, while they are being offered a mere Rs20,000 to Rs25,000 as compensation against losses worth millions,” he said.
The meeting emphasised the urgent need for rebuilding the destroyed agricultural infrastructure and called on the government to give the matter top priority. It also stressed the immediate formulation of a National Agriculture Restoration Policy and the creation of a committee comprising senior government officials and farmers’ representatives to rebuild the country’s agricultural economy, Mr Sadhraich concluded.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950102/beyond-baku-belem,Beyond Baku & Belem - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE UN climate conference (COP29) in Baku last year was credited with several achievements. It resolved the lingering issue of voluntary carbon credit trading systems between countries for reaching their emission reduction targets as set out in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. It operationalised the Loss and Damage Fund. Importantly, it agreed on a new financial goal for assisting developing countries.
In the two-layered arrangement of the ‘new collective quantified goal’, developed countries pledged to mobilise at least $300 billion annually by 2035. Recognising that the need for climate finance in developing countries far exceeds this amount, the second layer of the goal aims to raise $1.3 trillion by 2035 from all other sources. To chalk out a strategy and develop a step-by-step approach to realise the finance goals, COP29 also agreed on the Baku-to-Belem roadmap.
Mobilising such huge amounts was never going to be easy at a time when climate change continues to outpace climate action by leaps and bounds. In the months since Baku, environmental disasters have grown in ferocity and frequency, impeding long-term economic growth and exacerbating poverty and inequality. Each flood, heatwave, wildfire or drought brings disaster, reverses developmental gains and raises relief and reconstruction costs.
The challenge is compounded by geopolitical problems and conflicts. When countries augment their defence budgets, it often translates into slashing development funds. Climate and environmental agenda get relegated down the priority list. Last month, the UN reported that global military spending reached a record $2.7tr in 2024, the highest annual rise since the Cold War. Going by this trend, spending could climb as high as $6.6tr by 2035.
There are both challenges and opportunities.
Meanwhile, climate finance has struggled to keep pace with the impact of global warming, notwithstanding the pledges at Baku. With the next climate conference, COP30 in Brazil just weeks away, a quick check is in order to see if the world is living by its promises made in Baku.
To their credit, some major multilateral climate financing mechanisms have performed better than in previous years, raising and disbursing substantial amounts. The Green Climate Fund leads with a total portfolio of $66bn including co-financing. It has committed $18bn to projects mostly in the least developing countries of Asia and Africa.
The Adaptation Fund’s $2.01bn and the Global Environment Facility’s $24.33bn are part of the pool. The Loss and Damage Fund, still in its infancy, has received pledges amounting to $0.79bn. To complement, the World Bank raised its contribution to $31bn last year for financing that had climate co-benefits, up from $29.4bn for the previous financial year.
Regional development banks also chipped in with impressive shares. ADB committed $12.3bn in climate finance in 2024. Sixty per cent, or $7.4bn, was earmarked for climate change mitigation and the remaining $4.9bn for adaptation. In Africa, the continent with the lowest emissions of GHG, the African Development Bank seeks to mobilise $4bn this year for projects under its Climate Action Window. The second Africa Climate Summit in Addis Ababa last month, agreed to set up the Africa Climate Innovation Compact and the African Climate Facility to mobilise $50bn annually in climate finance.
However, the amounts mobilised or committed thus far are no way near the assessed needs for climate finance. UNEP’s Adaptation Gap Report 2024 puts the annual funding gap for adaptation between $187bn and $359bn.
Governments and multilateral development banks will need the private sector to fill this gap and put in place a strong financial scaffolding for climate change. The banking sect­­or, a key pla­y­­er in this field, faced a setback this mon­th when the Net-Zero Ban-king Allia­­nce paused operations, though banks will still be able to use its resources to set decarbonisation targets. The private sector’s full potential can only be catalysed by creating an enabling environment that fosters green investments, reduces risks and promotes accountability.
To navigate such difficult financial straits, the onus will be on governments to implement their new Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs 3.0 in a manner that frontload investments into climate change and find innovative ways of financing from other sources. Optimising nature-based solutions is a way to do more with less.
The journey from Baku to Belem and beyond is strewn with challenges but there are also opportunities, which must not be missed because climate action cannot be paused. Re-energising regional initiatives for climate and environment will surely help in making this journey less arduous.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950104/now-the-hard-part,"Now, the hard part - Newspaper - DAWN.COM","HECTIC diplomacy and decisive intervention by President Donald Trump produced a
ceasefire
in Gaza after two years of a brutal Israeli military offensive that left over 67,000 Palestinians dead, a humanitarian catastrophe and total devastation. Dramatic developments that culminated in the US president’s visit to the Middle East and the ‘peace summit’ in Sharm el-Sheikh aroused hopes of an ‘era of peace’. But that may be a distant possibility given the fragility of the ceasefire and the stumbling blocks facing the critical next phases of the peace process.
The peace declaration
signed
by Trump and leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye at Sharm el-Sheikh contains general principles. It states the commitment to implement the Trump peace agreement but without detailing or elaborating its various elements. The signing ceremony neither had a representative from Hamas nor Israel, the two parties to the ceasefire agreement. The ceasefire, in any case, marks the beginning of a process not its culmination.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proclaimed victory after Hamas
released
all the Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. But his commitment to honour the ceasefire and implement other steps of Trump’s 20-point plan, especially withdrawal from Gaza, is yet to be tested. His record is not encouraging. The last ceasefire in
January
was unilaterally ended by Israel after two months when it
restarted
its military onslaught. Tel Aviv also refused to negotiate further phases of what was earlier agreed.
This time Hamas sought written guarantees that Israel would not resume fighting once hostages were released. But it was unable to secure this. Instead, it got verbal assurances from the Americans. It will need Trump’s sustained engagement and pressure on Netanyahu to keep the peace process on track. Trump has staked his prestige on the Gaza deal,
casting
it as a “historic dawn of a new Middle East”. But he is not known to involve himself in detail that the plan’s implementation will require in the weeks ahead. Trump’s attention span is famously short.
With a fragile ceasefire in place, the path to peace in Gaza is strewn with formidable obstacles.
The next phase will involve intense negotiations to reach agreement on key aspects of the Trump plan, including demilitarisation of the territory, dismantling Hamas, pullout of Israeli forces from Gaza and deployment of a multinational stabilisation force. These are all vexing issues on which there is a yawning gap between the positions of Hamas and Israel. On Gaza’s post-conflict governance, convergence has yet to be evolved between the Palestinians/ Arab governments and Washington. The US has baulked at addressing the all-important issue of Palestinian statehood, for which Muslim countries want some assurance beyond the vague reference in Trump’s plan to “a pathway” to statehood.
Hamas is expected to disarm under the plan but has given no unequivocal assurance to give up arms as there is no commitment from Israel to withdraw from Gaza. Hamas leaders have indicated that without a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the territory they will not lay down their arms. A senior Hamas leader, Mousa Abu Marzouk, has said his organisation would only hand over weapons “if the occupation ends and Palestinians can govern themselves”. Others have said they want an iron-clad assurance about the establishment of a Palestinian state.
Trump’s 20-point plan does not address how to sequence Gaza’s demilitarisation with an Israeli pullout. It does not specify a timetable to achieve these two evidently linked goals. This will have to be negotiated which will not be easy, especially as Netanyahu has not committed to a full withdrawal from Gaza. With Israeli officials already claiming Hamas is tightening control over areas that their forces initially vacated, Netanyahu can indefinitely delay the drawdown. Tel Aviv can even derail the process, citing lack of movement on disbanding Hamas.
There are also many unanswered questions about the ‘temporary stabilisation force’ envisioned for Gaza to secure the Strip. The US has already sent 200 troops to Israel to be deployed as part of the so-called civil-military coordination centre to help the stabilisation force monitor the ceasefire and oversee the peace. The terms and rules of engagement of the international stabilisation force (ISF) are purposely absent in the plan and will need to be thrashed out. Negotiations are said to be underway on this.
Will this force have a UN mandate authorised by a Security Council resolution? Several Arab states have shown preference for that. Western members of the P5 are said to be working on a resolution to establish a stabilisation force but not one that operates under the UN flag. Any expectation for its role to involve counter-insurgency or disarm Hamas would be hard for potential troop-contributing countries to accept. No Muslim/ Arab state would want to be seen as acting against Palestinians on Israel’s behalf or protecting Israel. ISF’s size, composition, who will lead it, precise role and how long it is deployed all have to be figured out in negotiations.
Its deployment has to be closely synchronised with the post-conflict governing arrangement in Gaza. Under the plan, a ‘Board of Peace’ headed by Trump is to supervise the temporary transitional governance by a committee of Palestinian technocrats and international experts who are to be responsible for day-to-day affairs. Again, who will constitute this committee and how legitimate will it be, are questions that still have to be grappled with. This international trusteeship arrangement, until a reformed Palestinian Authority takes over, will basically mean Gaza is run by outsiders for an unspecified period in a colonial-style enterprise. How viable this will be — and acceptable to the Palestinians — is an open question. Authority after all depends on legitimacy.
The challenges ahead are daunting. There are already signs of brewing trouble that can unravel the peace plan. Israel has
continued
to shell Gaza and kill Palestinians during the tenuous ceasefire and delayed full access for humanitarian aid. Hamas has handed over a list of Israeli violations to mediators. Israel has threatened to resume fighting if Hamas doesn’t comply with the deal. Echoing Israel’s threat, Trump has said he would allow Israel to restart military action if the organisation does not lay down its arms. All this suggests that the path to what Trump envisions as a “new dawn” in the Middle East remains a long and uncertain one.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950108/need-for-safeguards,Need for safeguards - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"ONE of the key manifestations of extremism in Pakistan is the misuse of blasphemy laws. While sacrilege can never be condoned, it is the misuse of these laws to settle personal scores and persecute vulnerable groups that has led to frequent bouts of violence in society.
In this regard, the government has
stated its intent to reform the laws
in order to prevent abuse. While speaking at an event at the Supreme Court recently, the federal law minister said that “procedural safeguards” were being introduced in blasphemy-related cases to prevent misuse. At the same event, the chief justice of Pakistan highlighted the need for interfaith harmony.
While specifics are not available, any progress in this regard should be welcomed, though it must be remembered that previous efforts at reform — even those led by the higher judiciary — have stalled due to the pushback from extremist lobbies.
Calls for reform of the blasphemy laws, and legal safeguards, are by no means a defence of sacrilege. For harmony in society, no abuse against the revered figures and scriptures of all faiths can be tolerated, and there can be no room for hate speech. Instead, what activists have been saying for decades is that the misuse of the laws has to be prevented. We have seen far too many incidents where personal disputes have led to accusations of blasphemy, while in other instances, sacrilege allegations have been used to dispossess minorities of their land.
Moreover, recently a gang of criminals was uncovered that would trap people online and blackmail them, threatening to go public with false blasphemy allegations against the victims unless they paid up.
Clearly, steps need to be taken, as innocent people have lost their lives simply on the basis of unproven claims and spurious ‘evidence’. Even the head of the Council of Islamic Ideology
said
last year that certain “religious elements” were misusing the laws and resorting to “mob justice”, which is “un-Islamic”.
If the state’s latest attempt to reform the said laws is to succeed, then there needs to be buy-in from mainstream clerics. Unless clergymen of all sects endorse the state’s move, and extremist voices are isolated, the initiative is unlikely to succeed. But beyond legal changes, to end the troubling culture of false blasphemy allegations, there needs to be grassroots change in society, so that sensitive religious issues are not used to target people.
Countering violent extremism has been highlighted both in NAP and NAP 2.0, yet beyond solemn promises, successive administrations have done little on the ground to translate these aims into policy. Holding conferences and issuing statements is not enough. Conversations must be held in neighbourhood mosques, madressahs, schools and bazaars to communicate the message, and adopt a ‘whole-of-society’ approach against extremism.

told
him India will stop buying Russian oil, while warning that New Delhi would continue paying “massive” tariffs if it did not do so.
“I spoke with Prime Minister Modi of India, and he said he’s not going to be doing the Russian oil thing,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.
Asked about India’s assertion that it was
not aware
of any conversation between Modi and Trump, Trump replied: “But if they want to say that, then they’ll just continue to pay massive tariffs, and they don’t want to do that.”
Russian oil has been one of the main irritants for Trump in prolonged trade talks with India — half of his
50 per cent tariffs
on Indian goods are in retaliation for those purchases.
The US government has said that petroleum revenue
funds
Russia’s war in Ukraine.
India has become the
biggest buyer
of seaborne Russian oil sold at a discount after Western nations shunned purchases and imposed sanctions on Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Trump on Wednesday said Modi had assured him that day that India would stop its Russian oil purchases.
India’s foreign ministry said it was not aware of any telephone conversation between the leaders that day, but said that New Delhi’s main
concern
was to “safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer.”
A White House official said on Thursday that India has halved its purchases of Russian oil, but Indian sources said no immediate reduction had been seen.
The sources said Indian refiners already placed orders for November loading, including some slated for December arrival, so any cut may start showing up in December or January import numbers.

On this occasion the parent company unveiled its full capabilities in smart mobility, hybrid powertrains, engines and solid-state battery technology, demonstrating a deep integration of technology with the user experience.
As a long-term technology leader the parent company of OMODA & JAECOO has continuously pushed the boundaries of core powertrain technologies: it has broken through global battery safety limits, mastered solid-state battery technology and set industry benchmarks; it has ventured boldly into innovation no-man’s-land, achieving an engine thermal efficiency of 48 per cent — while mainstream engines typically range from 38pc to 45pc. Each 1pc increase in efficiency involves immense systemic challenges. The R&D team overcame these technical hurdles with multiple disruptive innovations including a 26:1 ultra-high expansion ratio, hyperbolic triple-linkage mechanisms, a 35pc EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) rate and thermal-insulation coatings, thereby remaining at the forefront of engine technology.
This breakthrough is not only a technical achievement but also reshapes the value proposition of hybrid vehicles: data show that for every 1pc increase in thermal efficiency, overall vehicle fuel consumption can drop by approximately 2.5pc. In future hybrid vehicles are expected to enter the “1-litre fuel-consumption era”, approaching the energy cost of pure electric vehicles and delivering long-term economic and practical value to users. Meanwhile the launch of AIMOGA (Moja Robot), the intelligent service platform, was unveiled at the event, showcasing the brand’s practical application of AI and human-machine interaction, making technology truly serve users’ lives.
The core technology highlights of OMODA & JAECOO hybrid vehicles were also comprehensively presented during the summit, demonstrating the brand’s leadership in power and energy efficiency. Equipped with the world-leading SHS Super Hybrid System, the three core components work in deep synergy to achieve super performance, super range, ultra-low energy consumption and super power. The fifth-generation 1.5 TDGI hybrid-dedicated engine incorporates a deep Miller cycle, i-HEC intelligent combustion system and six other advanced technologies, achieving a thermal efficiency of 44.5pc and fuel consumption as low as 5.99 L/100 km, thus balancing powerful performance with ultimate efficiency.
The hybrid-dedicated infinitely variable super-electric DHT intelligently switches driving modes according to vehicle speed, precisely matching power and fuel requirements under different conditions. The high-performance hybrid battery pack features comprehensive protection including heat resistance, impact resistance, waterproofing and 2-millisecond post-collision power-cut protection, supporting a 90km pure electric range and 3.3kW external power output, thereby ensuring safety, endurance and outdoor power applications. During this long-distance test, OMODA & JAECOO hybrid vehicles handled all road conditions easily, ensuring stress-free long journeys.
International Technology Night was not just a technology showcase but also a stage for global users and partners to witness co-creation achievements. During the event Vietnamese user and content creator Bach Thanh Trung shared his real-life driving experience in
My Daily Life with the JAECOO J7 SHS
. He spoke sincerely about how the J7 SHS integrates into his daily routine: quiet electric mode for weekdays, hybrid power for weekend adventures; the vehicle also provides convenient mobile power support for camping and outdoor work. His words conveyed JAECOO’s core spirit; versatile, free and agile,  meeting daily mobility needs while enabling users to explore life’s possibilities.
In addition to user-experience sharing, International Technology Night gathered global media and partners to witness the brand’s technology and user co-creation achievements. During the awards ceremony Kuwaiti KOL Mohammad Alkandari and Turkish senior journalist Hirant Kasapoglu received the Global Eco Co-Creation Excellence Award, alongside other international partners, demonstrating the diversity and global influence of the OMODA & JAECOO ecosystem. Applause and cheers throughout the venue highlighted the brand’s steady steps in promoting user co-creation and smart mobility worldwide.
The success of International Technology Night not only showcased OMODA & JAECOO and its parent company’s comprehensive strength in smart mobility and core powertrain technologies but also reaffirmed the brand’s commitment to co-creating a better life with users. In future OMODA & JAECOO will continue integrating technology and ecosystem resources with a global vision, enabling more users to experience intelligent, free and diversified mobility, and jointly shaping a green, smart and sustainable future of transportation.

Afridi had
filed
the plea on Oct 17, two days after he was sworn in as the provincial chief executive on Oct 15. He had gone to Adiala jail — where Imran has been
imprisoned since September 2023
— after
getting protective bail
from the Peshawar High Court on Oct 16. However, he was denied the
meeting
; Afridi has stated that he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran. He had then filed a plea with the IHC, however, the registrar’s office had
objected
to the maintainability of the plea.
Today, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir took up the matter and overruled the objections of the registrar office.
Afridi’s lawyer Advocate Ali Bukhari said that the registrar’s office had raised the objection that the petition was filed “without the provincial cabinet and government’s decision”.
“This objection has no standing as the cabinet has not been constituted as yet,” he contended.
Subsequently, the court removed the objections and issued notices to the interior secretary, the Punjab Home Department secretary, the Punjab inspector general of prisons and the Adiala jail superintendent for Oct 23.
The petition filed by Afridi had contended that the KP government had earlier submitted formal requests to the federal interior ministry and the Punjab home department to allow a meeting with Imran, but no approval was granted.
The plea maintained that consultation with the PTI founder was “legally and ethically necessary” for the chief minister in connection with key administrative and political decisions, including cabinet formation.
Meanwhile, in its objections the IHC registrar’s office had noted that the court had already adjudicated similar matters and had laid down a procedure for seeking permission to meet the PTI founder. The office questioned how a new petition could be filed without following the prescribed process.
Correction: This story previously incorrectly stated that the Islamabad High Court had issued a notice to the Punjab inspector general of police. However, the notice has been issued to the Punjab inspector general of prisons. The error is regretted.",2025-10-20,Tahir Naseer,592,0.000104
https://www.dawn.com/news/1950173/pakistan-afghanistan-peace-hinges-on-taliban-halting-incursions-defence-minister-asif,Pakistan-Afghanistan peace hinges on Taliban halting incursions: Defence Minister Asif - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that the
ceasefire agreement
between Islamabad and Kabul was linked to the Afghan Taliban’s ability to rein in terrorists attacking Pakistan from neighbouring soil.
The two countries agreed to a ceasefire in Doha at the weekend after days of
border clashes
that killed dozens, the worst such violence since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021. Ground fighting between the one-time allies and Pakistani airstrikes across their contested 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control terrorists it says operate from safe havens in Afghanistan.
“Anything coming from Afghanistan will be [a] violation of this agreement,” Asif said in his office at Parliament in Islamabad. “Everything hinges on this one clause.”
The Taliban administration and Afghanistan’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“In the agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkiye and Qatar, it was clearly spelled out that there would not be any incursions,” the minister said.
“We have a ceasefire agreement as long as there is no violation of the agreement which is already in force.”
The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militant group operated out of Afghanistan to attack Pakistan “in connivance” with the Taliban, the defence minister said.
Kabul has previously denied such accusations.
In a separate interview to
Al-Jazeera Arabic
, he said the primary objective of the ceasefire agreement was to “eliminate the menace of terrorism”.
Asif added that terrorism has been affecting the Pak-Afghan border areas for years.
He elaborated that both countries concluded that the immediate eradication of terrorism was essential. The two sides, he added, would make serious efforts to curb terrorism; otherwise, regional peace could face grave threats.
Asif said the agreement was primarily reached through the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye, adding that both countries’ presence served as a guarantee for the accord.
The defence minister also appreciated the
role played
by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in facilitating the agreement.
Asif maintained that another meeting would be held next week in Istanbul to finalise the details of the agreement, and an effective mechanism would also be devised to resolve the existing issues between the two countries.
He further said that his Afghan counterpart had also acknowledged terrorism as the main cause of tension in bilateral relations, which would now be addressed.
The defence czar stated that Pakistan has suffered immense human and financial losses over the past years due to terrorism. However, he expressed hope that peace would now return and relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan would normalise.
As a result, he said, Pakistan-Afghanistan trade and transit activities would resume, enabling the latter to use the former’s ports once again.
Asif also added that Afghan refugees holding valid visas and documents would be allowed to stay in Pakistan. However, a large number of undocumented refugees would continue to be repatriated, he added.
The minister said it was premature to claim satisfaction over the resolution of all concerns. “We will have to see in the coming weeks and months how effectively the agreement is implemented,” he said.
In a separate
interview
to
Arab News
, he ruled out the notion that Pakistan had conducted the airstrikes in Kabul on the urging of the United States, saying: “It is total nonsense and nothing else.”
He questioned why Pakistan would do so, saying the country had had enough of its involvement in Afghanistan for the past few decades.
“We want to stay away and live like decent neighbours. We don’t want to have any involvement in Afghan affairs,” Asif said, adding that Pakistan had “no business” in Afghanistan’s relationship with India or any other country.
“Absolutely not. Whatever they want to do in their own territory and doesn’t spill over to our territory, doesn’t become our business.”
Doha talks and press release controversy
Speaking later in an interview on
Geo News
show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Asif said the Doha talks were not held in a bitter atmosphere and credited the Qatari and Turkish officials for it.
“Not even an opportunity for confrontation was provided on any conflicting point,” he said, adding that all talk of amendments and additions or deletions was done through the Qatari and Turkish officials.
“Direct interaction only happened at the opening, where both sides talked … but all of the engagement was done through Qatar and Turkiye.”
Asif added the draft agreement was only one page, contrary to a longer version he said was circulating on social media. He added that an upcoming meeting in Turkiye would further refine the details, such as the mechanism to implement the deal’s aspects.
Questioned about his own thoughts about whether the ceasefire would hold, the defence minister said: “I have guarded optimism on the matter; I am hopeful but also remain cautious. Can only say something conclusively given the circumstantial evidence. It is too early at the moment, we must remain hopeful of course.”
The minister added that he hoped that the Afghan Taliban would act as a “unified government” and conclude the matter with Pakistan instead of returning tomorrow and saying that separate factions were behind the tensions.
He elaborated that in the case of any violation, Qatar and Turkiye would be asked to play their role. Asif added that the mechanism for this entire process would be decided in the meeting on the October 25.
The defence minister also stated that the entire TTP leadership was present in Afghanistan, adding that the matter would be taken up in Istanbul as well. He further said that the talks should not be taken to mean that Pakistan would negotiate or hold talks with the TTP, dismissing such a notion.
Questioned about changes in Qatar’s press releases on the ceasefire with “tensions on the border” removed in a subsequent statement, Asif acknowledged that there was debate on wherever the word was used, but ultimately Qatar’s press release had nothing to do with the draft of the agreement, adding that he could not divulge its contents.
“It is between them. It has absolutely no effect on the agreement,” he said, adding that the incident had no particular implications as were being derived by others.",2025-10-20,APP,1609,0.000181

rose to fame
as ‘chaiwala’, was restored by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) after verification.
Khan, who hails from Mardan, rose to fame back in 2016 when a photographer shared a photo of him pouring tea on Instagram, which went viral. He
approached
the LHC in April against the blocking of his identity documents by Nadra and the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports.
An order issued today by LHC Justice Justice Jawad Hassan noted that the petitioner informed the court his grievance was redressed.
“Learned counsel for the petitioner … submits that after this court had taken cognizance of the matter, the competent authority called the petitioner to appear before the verification board constituted at the concerned office of Nadra and after due verification, his CNIC has been unblocked, thereby redressing his grievance,” the order noted.
It added that Khan’s counsel said the petitioner did not want to proceed with the main writ petition since his CNIC was unblocked by Nadra, also confirmed by the law officer after obtaining instructions from the concerned quarters.
The judge subsequently dismissed the main petition, noting it had “borne fruit”.
Speaking
to the media after the hearing, Barrister Umer Ijaz Gilani said the issue was taken up at the government’s “highest level”, after which the verification process was initiated by Nadra, with the result being that the CNIC was determined to be wrongfully blocked.
Khan himself said he was a Pakistani and would always remain one.
Khan, who used to work at Islamabad’s Sunday Bazaar on Peshawar Chowk, had become popular overnight. Within no time, countless people had begun visiting his shop just to take selfies with him and soon, a modeling agency also entered into a deal with him and shot a few commercials to make good use of the craze.",2025-10-20,Tahir Naseer,498,9.7e-05

captain
, the country’s cricket board announced on Monday.
The national side’s pace spearhead will lead Pakistan in the upcoming three-match series against South Africa.
Shaheen replaces Mohammad Rizwan as the Pakistan ODI skipper after the wicket-keeper led the team during a disastrous ICC Champions Trophy campaign before series losses in New Zealand and the West Indies.
Rizwan, handed captaincy in 2024, had led the team to series wins in South Africa, Australia and Zimbabwe in his early days as captain, however. But the recent failures apparently were a decisive enough factor for the Pakistan Cricket Board to sack Rizwan.
For Shaheen, it’s going to be a second stint as the Pakistan captain, the left-armer having been snubbed after a short spell — five T20Is against New Zealand — at the helm after replacing Babar Azam in late 2023 following Pakistan’s dismal World Cup campaign.
The 25-year-old, who has been captaining Pakistan Super League side Lahore Qalandars for the last few years, seems to be Pakistan white-ball head coach Mike Hesson’s pick as the team’s leader going into the build-up for the 2027 World Cup.
“Shaheen’s appointment for the upcoming series was finalised today following a meeting held in Islamabad, which was attended by white-ball head coach Mike Hesson, Director High Performance Aqib Javed and members of the selection committee,” a short press release by the PCB said.
Shaheen has represented Pakistan in 66 ODIs and 92 T20Is, taking a combined 249 wickets. In 32 Tests, excluding the ongoing second Test against South Africa at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, Shaheen has claimed 120 wickets.
The PCB regime, led by Mohsin Naqvi since February 2024, has chopped and changed captains repeatedly. It first removed Shaheen as captain to bring back Babar Azam as white-ball skipper in the first half of 2024.
Later, Babar, owing to the team’s poor performance in the T20 World Cup, decided to step down, after which Mohammad Rizwan was given the reins of the white-ball team.",2025-10-20,Dawn.com,529,0.0001

According to Sarfraz, the father of the alleged victim, Hira (16), a resident of Mari village in Sargodha district, his daughter was employed as a maid at the house of Dr Umar Meikan, who also belongs to the same village, but resides in Lahore.
He alleged that Dr Meikan and his wife would not allow him to meet his daughter.
Sarfraz further said that on the intervention of some village elders, Dr Meikan finally allowed him and his wife to see their daughter.
He alleged that when they reached Dr Meikan’s house in Lahore, they found Hira in a miserable condition with her head shaved. He said the girl told them that Dr Meikan, with the help of his wife, allegedly shaved her head.
Sarfarz said, quoting his daughter, that the couple would also subject Hira to torture by giving her electric shocks. He also alleged that the employers would starve the girl and force her to stay awake all night.
The victim also alleged while talking to the media that the couple would not pay her salary as they adjust the amount against the cost of some utensils which got broken.
Sarfarz alleged that Dr Meikan had threaten to implicate him in a “fabricated” theft case if he reported the matter to police.
He said that they had earlier reported the matter to the Jhal Chakian police on Oct 18, but they were told that because the alleged atrocities were committed in Lahore, the case would be registered there.
However, when the video clip of the girl surfaced on social media, the police registered a case against the couple on the night of Oct 19 under sections 337-V and 354/34 of the Pakistan Penal Code and arrested Dr Meikan.
On the other hand, the arrested suspect says that the girl was employed at his sister’s house and allegedly committed thefts. Dr Meikan says that earlier Sarfarz had admitted his daughter’s “crime”, but after her video clip went viral on social media, he demanded Rs1 million for not implicating him and his wife in a “false” case.
Sources say that the police are also looking for Dr Meikan’s wife, who is also nominated in the FIR.

“A narrative is being built that I will go for confrontation with the federal government. Yes, I will, if anything is done by it against the Constitution. I will continue to speak for the supremacy of the Constitution,” he told a provincial assembly session chaired by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati here.
The chief minister said that he wrote letters to the chief justice of Pakistan and federal and provincial governments and even
petitioned
the Islamabad High Court for ensuring his meeting with detained founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Imran Khan but to no avail.
He said he would challenge the federal government over the continued denial of his meeting with Imran and would boycott meetings called by it.
Informs assembly that there won’t be any political arrests under MPO in province
Mr Afridi said that after exhausting all legal options for the purpose, he would place his case
before the people
to devise the future course of action.
He said that the law and order situation was worsening as the decisions were taken behind closed doors.
“Our [PTI’s] stand is that policies for KP should be made by the province’s government and its residents only,” he said, vowing to resist any decisions taken behind closed doors.
The chief minister said his government
welcomed
peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban in Doha but had reservations about it as elders and public representatives from KP should be part of the dialogue as advocated by the PTI founder.
He announced that no political worker would be arrested under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order in the province, while the police won’t register FIR against any student leader.
Mr Afridi also announced the establishment of police stations for women across the province.
He said that the meeting called by the prime minister was about Afghan refugees and food security and not the law and order situation, so he sent the chief secretary as the province’s representative besides Muzammil Asalam who was aware of the situation in KP.
“Our stand on Afghan refugees is clear. Those, who have lived here for over 40 years, should be sent back in a dignified way. Those stationed on the border should not create issues about the
repatriation
of Afghan refugees,” he said.
The chief minister said that the police and the counter-terrorism department were leading the fight against terrorists from the front.
“The vehicles gifted by the federal government to our police force have become outdated, so we have decided to return them,” he said.
Earlier, Leader of the Opposition in the assembly Dr Ibadullah said working for peace in the province was the top priority of every MPA. He urged the chair to call a meeting of the house’s peace committee.
Dr Ibadullah said that the opposition would never allow any action that went against the interest of the province.
“The opposition will stand with the government in case of any positive step taken in the interest of the province,” he said.
The opposition leader vowed to highlight the government’s weak performances.
He insisted that the opposition never opposed Mr Afridi’s meeting with Mr Imran.
Mr Swati observed that the first meeting of the house’s peace committee would be held soon after the finalisation of its terms of references, with all relevant government officers being asked to show up.
Treasury lawmaker Adnan Qadri said Mr Afridi’s victory in the chief minister’s election was the victory of the people and the defeat of all “other powers.”
He said people from tribal districts thanked the PTI founder for nominating Mr Afridi from among them as the province’s chief executive.
”Those who held news conferences against the new chief minister disheartened the tribesmen,” he said.
Mr Qadri also condemned the alleged killing of TLP workers during street protests in Punjab and demanded their names be made public.
MPA Dr Amjad Ali said if the Pakistan Army could take over 34 posts on Pak-Afghan border, why they didn’t eliminate 500 terrorists from Bajaur district in the last three months. He said Pakistan wanted talks with India after border clashes but never held negotiations with Pakhtuns.
The MPA said he, as the minister for mines and minerals, was denied access to mines in merged tribal districts by security forces citing the delicate law and order situation as the reason.
“The Katlang area where a
drone strike
was carried out, has vast pink topaz reserves. Pink topaz is found in Brazil or Katlang only,” he said.
Mohammad Nisar of the opposition ANP said for the first time, he felt the house was serious about discussing the issues of merged tribal districts.
He said terrorists were identified in some villages but even then, 13 civilians, including women, children and elderly, were martyred with no body of the terrorists found.
“We are not aliens. We want an end to the buffer zone. We want developmental funds to be spent in our merged areas,” he said.
The lawmaker said efforts were under way for the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, to get control of
KP’s mines and minerals
and declare the merged districts federal territory,” he said. The speaker congratulated Hindu community’s members on diwali, the festival of lights.
The house also passed a resolution by a majority vote, urging the provincial government to inform the United Nations that the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa do not accept Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the nation’s representatives nor does they recognise Israel.
The resolution was tabled by Abdul Salam Afridi, whose another resolution seeking medical facilities for Imran and his wife in jail, was also adopted.
The chair later adjourned the sitting until 2 pm today (Tuesday).

filed
by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi for a meeting with PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail, while separate anti-terrorism courts issued non-bailable arrest warrants for several PTI leaders, including Imran Khan’s sister,
Aleema Khan
.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir of the IHC heard the petition, with Advocate Ali Bukhari appearing on behalf of the KP chief minister. The plea, filed through Advocate General Shah Faisal, sought the court’s direction to the jail authorities to allow a meeting between the PTI founder and the provincial chief executive to discuss matters concerning governance and the formation of the new cabinet.
Earlier, the registrar’s office had raised
objections
, noting that similar petitions had been decided earlier and that a prescribed procedure existed for seeking such meetings. However, Advocate Bukhari argued that the petition carried “fresh legal grounds”, as the provincial cabinet had yet to be formed and consultation with the PTI founder was necessary for administrative decision-making.
After hearing arguments, Justice Arbab Tahir dismissed the objections and issued notices to the Secretary Home, Inspector General of Police, and Superintendent Adiala Jail, directing them to submit responses by October 23. The petition maintained that despite prior requests made to the federal interior ministry and Punjab home department, no permission had been granted for the meeting, which the KP government described as “legally and ethically necessary” for governance.

Arrest warrants
Meanwhile, in Rawalpindi, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah once again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, in connection with the November 26, 2024, protests. The warrant was reissued due to her continued absence from proceedings in a case registered at the Sadiqabad Police Station.
The court directed Superintendent of Police (Rawal Division) Muhammad Saad to arrest and produce Aleema Khan before the court on Oct 22. It also ordered the confiscation of her surety bond and the verification of property documents submitted by her guarantor.
Ms Khan, along with her sister Uzma Khan and several PTI supporters, had previously been arrested during demonstrations at D-Chowk last year but was later
released
on bail.
In a separate development, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra in Islamabad issued non-bailable arrest warrants for PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Zain Qureshi, Zartaj Gul and Advocate Ali Bukhari in cases related to alleged unrest and violations of law during a PTI rally held at Sangjani.
During the hearing, the ATC directed the concerned police authorities to arrest the accused and produce them before the court on October 23.

• CM Bugti terms killing ‘deeply tragic,’ vows terrorism won’t derail democracy; Maulana Hidayatur Rehman opposes in-camera briefing
• Waleed Saleh Baloch laid to rest in Panjgur amid large gathering of mourners and political leaders
QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Monday unanimously adopted a condemnation resolution against the
killing
of Waleed Saleh Baloch, brother of National Party leader and member of the provincial assembly (MPA) Mir Rahmat Saleh Baloch.
Speaker retired Captain Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, who presided over the session, also ruled that an in-camera session on the province’s
deteriorating
law and order situation would be convened soon and the exact date would be announced within a day or two.
At the request of Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, the speaker adjourned the House after the adoption of the joint resolution.
Moving the resolution, National Party President Dr. Abdul Malik Baloch expressed grief and sorrow over the tragic incident and demanded the immediate arrest of those involved in the killing.
He said that Waleed Baloch was murdered in Panjgur during a wedding ceremony, adding that the law and order situation in the province had worsened to the point where people no longer felt safe travelling on highways.
‘Deeply tragic’
CM Bugti called for a special in-camera briefing in the assembly on the province’s security situation. “The killing of Waleed Baloch is deeply tragic. Terrorism, by whatever name it occurs, is terrorism and must be condemned,” he said. Mr Bugti added that the adjournment of assembly proceedings reflected collective grief and sent a clear message to terrorists that they could not derail the democratic process. “We will not retreat even an inch from democracy,” he asserted.
He further said that despite past terrorist attacks on educational institutions, schools and universities were now active again. “The Baloch are being pushed into an unwinnable conflict through terrorism, but we stand with our security forces in this war,” the chief minister stated.
Leader of the Opposition Mir Younas Aziz Zehri said, “The terrorists have martyred Waleed Baloch and plunged the entire province into mourning. If they think such actions can deter us from our mission, they are mistaken. We may live or die, but this province and country will remain.”
In-camera briefing opposed
MPA Maulana Hidayatur Rehman Baloch criticised the assembly for offering repeated condemnations without action, saying it had “become a place for condolences”. He alleged that armed groups were openly extorting money in his constituency while security personnel focused on minor issues instead of combating terrorism.
He opposed another in-camera briefing, saying, “Let’s discuss the issue openly instead of holding a speech contest under the name of an in-camera session.”
Earlier, Waleed Saleh Baloch was laid to rest on Sunday at his ancestral graveyard in Panjgur.
He was gunned down by unidentified assailants near his residence in Chitkan, a locality on the outskirts of Panjgur city.
A large number of people, including leaders of various political parties, Dr. Abdul Malik Baloch, Senator Jan Buledi, MNA Pullain Baloch, Deputy Commissioner Abdul Kabir Zarkoon, District Police Officer Dost Muhammad Bugti, central and provincial leaders of the National Party, tribal elders, and citizens attended the funeral.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950281/8-militants-gunned-down-in-dera-ismail-khan,8 militants gunned down in Dera Ismail Khan - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least eight alleged terrorists were gunned down by security forces in an operation on Monday, after a team from Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) came under attack near the Kot Lalu area in Daraban, Dera Ismail Khan.
The action came in an apparent response to an attack on the SNGPL team, in which security forces reportedly also suffered casualties. However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) or other security agencies about their losses until going to press.
Sources said the militants were killed after intelligence reports were received about their presence in a nearby jungle, prompting the security forces to launch an offensive in which eight suspects were gunned down.
Following the action, the forces cordoned off the area and initiated wide-ranging search-and-clearance operations in the surrounding terrain. Reinforcements were dispatched to secure the site and to pursue the fleeing suspects.
Two suspects killed in Swabi encounter; attack on Bannu police station repulsed
Officials told reporters that the slain militants allegedly were members of a cell that had been planning a direct attack on the pipeline project. They said the group intended to sabotage the installation — a project of national importance aimed at providing energy, employment and improved services to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Investigations were ongoing and local authorities said they would share further details as the clearance operation and forensic work proceeded.
Two killed in Swabi
Separately, two militants were killed in a joint operation conducted by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Mardan and the Swabi district police before midnight, Ziauddin Ahmad, the district police officer, said on Monday. The incident took place three days after a hand grenade was hurled at the Kalabat police post by unidentified men, in which a constable was martyred.
According to a separate press release, the CTD and Swabi police were engaged in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in mountainous Maini village when four alleged militants riding two motorcycles opened fire on the law enforcers.
“The CTD operation party retaliated with full vigour. As a result, terrorists were killed on the spot, and their two accomplices escaped, taking advantage of darkness,” said DPO Ahmad.
Soon after the incident, a search and strike operation was launched in the area. The slain men allegedly belonged to the TTP Tayyip Akbar Group and were wanted in numerous cases, including attacks on the police.
Attack repelled
Separately, an attack targeting the police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu district late Sunday night was thwarted by the police. A police official said that a group of militants attacked the police station with advanced light and heavy weapons in a bid to breach the building.
“But the personnel deployed there were fully alert as they had noticed the terrorists’ movements with the help of thermal vision cameras,” he said, adding that the law enforcers countered the attack vigorously and forced the assailants to flee.
The official said that after hearing about the attack on the police station, local residents armed with weapons also came out of their houses and assisted police in their action against terrorists. He said that all policemen remain safe in the attack.
Meanwhile, two policemen who had been kidnapped from the Peepal Bazaar in Bannu on Monday were freed by their captors. A police official said that two police officials, including Naheedullah and Eid Muhammad, were kidnapped by unknown armed men when they were returning to their duty place after performing their duty with the polio teams.

“Hopefully, permission will be granted soon,” he said, adding that the government is working on meeting international standards and enhancing safety protocols, which could lead to expanded global routes.
A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) spokesman highlighted the significance of US routes for PIA, emphasising the strong demand for non-stop flights from Pakistanis living in North America.

According to an aviation expert, a team from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had recently visited Pakistan to conduct a safety audit.
A positive outcome from these audits could result in PIA achieving Category 1 status from the FAA, which is crucial for the resumption of direct flights to the US.
PIA codeshare with Etihad
Meanwhile, PIA announced on Monday it has entered into a codeshare agreement with UAE’s Etihad Airways.
The partnership, set to take effect from Oct 31, will extend to cargo services and frequent flyer programmes.
“This agreement marks a milestone for PIA,” a spokesperson said, adding that it will encompass passenger flights as well. The arrangement will primarily benefit routes not directly serviced by PIA, allowing passengers access to Etihad’s expansive network.
The codeshare is expected to enhance PIA’s service offerings and contribute to increased revenue, the spokesperson noted.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Sar­dar Moh­ammad Sarfraz Dogar and Jus­­tice Khadim Hussain Soo­mro will take up the bar’s plea on Wed­nesday (tomorrow).
The petition was filed by IBA President Chau­dhry Naeem Gujjar.
The Islamabad District Bar Association has approached the court, contending that it is the principal stakeholder in matters relating to the independence of the judiciary and the supremacy of the Consti­tu­tion.
The application argued that fair and transparent adjudication of the pending writ petition would be impossible without hearing the bar as a party, since the issues involved are of “fundamental importance” to the legal fraternity and the rule of law.
The association emphasised that under its Memorandum of Association (2016), it is mandated to safeguard the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, and civil liberties. It further maintained that the bar has historically been at the forefront of struggles for constitutional supremacy and must therefore be heard in this matter.
The plea recalled that the bar’s functions include facilitating its members in the performance of their professional duties, protecting their interests, and maintaining high standards of integrity and ethical conduct.
“The Islamabad Bar is resolute in shielding the superior judiciary from attacks, whether internal or external, and in striving for the supremacy of the Constitution,” the application stated.

The groundbreaking ruling has strengthened protections for wor­k­ing women across the country.
The order came in response to a complaint filed by Ms. Zainab Zahrah Awan, who was terminated in April 2024 while on duly sanctioned maternity leave.
The Ombudsperson ruled that such termination not only viola­tes the Protection against Har­as­sment of Women at the Workplace

FOSPAH directed that Rs800,000 be paid to the complainant as compensation and Rs200,000 deposited into the national treasury, declaring the termination letter null and void and restoring the complainant’s employment status.
In her detailed judgement, the Om­­budsperson emphasised that maternity protections are non-negotiable and inviolable
rights
, reinforced by Pakistan’s commitments under international instruments such as CEDAW, ICESCR, and ILO conventions.
“Safe motherhood is not a favour — it is a fundamental right,” the order stated, adding, “No woman should be forced to choose between her career and motherhood.”
The Ombudsperson reaffirmed that all employers must uphold women’s dignity and equality at the workplace.
The decision sets a significant precedent for women’s workplace rights in Pakistan, underscoring that any termination during maternity leave is unlawful and amounts to gender-based discrimination.

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif on Monday revealed that the government was forming a
National Commission for Minorities
(NCM) to safeguard their rights.
“Parliament has given its approval and work is in progress on proposed National Commission for Minorities and the government has rolled out targeted support programmes from scholarships for minority students at primary through tertiary levels to representation of minorities in federal and provincial assemblies,” the PM said at a ceremony held at the PM House on Diwali.
He
extended
Diwali greetings to the Hindu community and other religious minorities, calling the festival a “beautiful message of joy, peace and tolerance” and reaffirming the government’s commitment to protecting minority rights.
Addressing the event, which was attended by religious and diplomatic figures, members of minority communities and parliamentary representatives, the prime minister said the presence of Hindu, Christian and other minority leaders at the event reflected “the living reality of Pakistan’s pluralism”.
He reiterated that every citizen regardless of faith has the constitutional right to practise religious rituals without fear or intimidation. He urged Muslims and non-Muslims to work “shoulder to shoulder” to resist hatred, intolerance and extremism and to preserve Pakistan as a land of tolerance and peaceful coexistence.
Minister of State for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kheal Das Ko­­histani, on the occasion, paid tribute to the prime minister for organising Diw­ali celebrations officially at the PM House, making a unique historic moment.
Industrial production

Later, presiding over a separate meeting on small and medium enterprises (
SMEs
), PM Shehbaz directed the authorities concerned to encourage the registration of cottage SMEs to enable them avail business loans and pave the way for country’s industrial growth.
The prime minister appreciated the initiatives to enhance women’s participation in SMEs and called for awareness on such measures. He emphasised setting up a clear timeline for the implementation of Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority’s (Smeda) roadmap and its early execution.
The prime minister said the country’s industrial growth was linked with the development of cottage SMEs and cited the developed countries where they provide raw material to large industries. The premier directed to conduct the training for SMEs in rural areas for processing of agricultural commodities.
He expressed satisfaction with the industries and production ministry’s efforts for Smeda’s restructuring and SME development.
During the briefing on Smeda’s restr­u­cturing and initiatives, it was informed that offices had been established in Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan for SME development, which was welcomed by the public and chambers of commerce.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950299,Doha truce - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"AFTER over a week of hostilities during which some of the fiercest exchanges took place between Pakistan and Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, a fragile calm between the two countries has been established.
A long-term
ceasefire
was reached in Doha early on Sunday, where both sides pledged to continue the diplomatic process and find a permanent solution to the prevailing problem — cross-border incursions by Afghanistan-based terrorist groups. Qatar and Turkiye have played a key role in bringing about the truce, and representatives of both Islamabad and Kabul will meet in Istanbul on Saturday to take the process forward.
Though the Pakistani state and the Afghan Taliban once maintained cordial relations, matters have nosedived during the hard-line group’s second innings. At the heart of the matter is the sanctuary provided by the Afghan Taliban to the banned TTP and other militant groups that have staged bloody attacks in Pakistan. Though the Taliban deny this, there is overwhelming evidence that suggests that terrorist groups indeed have havens in Afghanistan.
Over the last few months, the attacks have
increased
significantly — over 600 attacks over the past year, according to one
report
— causing heavy casualties amongst Pakistani security men. It is because earlier attempts at dialogue failed to stop such attacks that the state took action, hitting militant targets across the border.
But while this may have sent a strong message to Kabul, if the hostilities continue, it will bode ill for peace in South Asia, as Pakistan will have to face adversaries on two hostile borders. Therefore, the state may have to combine deterrence through military means — in case of further attacks — with sustained diplomacy through common friends and regional allies to arrive at a long-term solution.
After the Doha parleys, the Taliban spokesman said there would be no “hostile actions” against Pakistan. While such promises have been made during earlier diplomatic encounters as well, for example earlier this year under Chinese auspices, it is hoped this time the Kabul regime is serious about stopping cross-border militant activity.
As Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar noted, a “verifiable monitoring mechanism” is needed to implement the broad details agreed to in Doha, which should be the goal during the next meeting in Turkiye. Though the Taliban may remain in denial, the international community agrees that they continue to host terrorist groups. Therefore, as the de facto government in Afghanistan, it is their duty to prevent these outfits from harming neighbouring states.
While some militant groups — the TTP, Al Qaeda — may respond to the Taliban ‘requests’, others, such as IS-K, are unlikely to oblige. However, it is the Taliban’s job as the governing entity in Afghanistan to ensure the security of regional states is not harmed by groups based on its soil.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950303,Too many battlefronts - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"IT has been some years since Anatol Lieven
called
Pakistan a ‘hard country’, a phrase which didn’t really get much traction. It just didn’t carry enough negative connotations; the rest of the world preferred sobriquets such as ‘failed state’ or ‘the most dangerous country in the world’. It left most of us who live in Pakistan with the sense that we had a tendency to attract attention for all the wrong reasons. And whatever our image, it wasn’t going to be one highlighting our softer attributes.
Now, it seems, we ourselves are trying to create a tough brand. Of being known as hard, a powerful state which no one can ride roughshod over, be it enemies within Pakistan or external.
These are not mere words. Just over the recent week, a protest originating from Lahore was
not allowed to make its way to Islamabad
, a destination which has been overrun by many others in the past. This was followed by a
crackdown
on the TLP, which had announced the protest, combined with allegations of state violence leading to loss of life. And while, the TLP itself has been guilty of violence on more than one occasion, the pattern of the state’s reaction has now become familiar. In the past couple of years, there have been protests in different parts of the country where political parties such as the PTI as well as citizen rights movements such as the PTM or BYC have all alleged loss of life. Religio-political organisations such as the TLP were treated a bit differently but not anymore. Those who convey the master’s message claim that the party will now be disbanded.
Around the same time, Islamabad’s relations with Kabul are also at an all-time low. It seems as if the time for playing nice is over and if the terrorist attacks in Pakistan continue, Islamabad will inflict pain on Afghanistan to change its big, bad ways. If earlier the pain was inflicted through
refugee repatriation
or border controls, now there will be more — the
targeting of terrorists
based there and skirmishes on the border. Over the weekend, these tensions led to our Gulf brethren entering the fray to
soothe the two neighbours
. What a turnaround; once seen as the patrons of the Afghan Taliban, Pakistan now needs intermediaries to make nice with them.
Picking so many battles leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time.
And these battles are being fought at a time when there are reports aplenty of another aggression from India. Be it official or unofficial voices, or even some from across the border, there are warnings enough of unfinished business on the eastern border. And what if this happens at a time when the western border is also tense? Especially as it’s not just the borders which can pose a threat? The tensions with both the neighbours are closely linked to the deteriorating security situation in two provinces — Balochistan and KP. Pakistan’s view is that the eastern and western neighbours are encouraging infiltration of terrorists and providing them with the finances. And so serious is this external factor that the debate over how the discontent in these provinces has been feeding into the violence has been abandoned.
In the tough posturing with aggressive neighbours and militant groups, there is confidence that Punjab and Sindh are under control. At this time and age, the absence of a mass people’s movement and violence means all is well. And if in one province, the water issue has led to simmering anger and in the other the government’s legitimacy is under question, these are smaller problems, for repression or concessions (as in Sindh on the water issue and in Azad Kashmir) can lead to a sense of quiet.
So much so that the state felt confident in cracking down on the TLP. Success has been declared, for there was no pushback and the street remained quiet. And there is so much applause that few are brave enough to ask what this will mean for the PML-N, whose members may have to face a backlash in their constituencies, as they did in 2018. This security threat will be an additional burden for them.
But overall, between the crackdowns on the people, parties, rights movements, militants and angry neighbours, it is difficult not to wonder whether the tough posturing or the effort at shaping a hard state may also be one that is overstretched. At odds with forces within as well as enemies without, what if the burden proves too much?
This is not to say it can’t win all these battles. Perhaps it can, though it is worth cautioning against excessive confidence. But there is another downside. Picking so many battles, especially with genuine grassroots movements or mainstream political parties, leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time.
Indeed, it is so busy fearing and controlling the people in general that it has no space and goodwill left to push through any reform which is politically hard. If an election has been managed in order to impose unpopular leaders, who is going to push the traders to pay taxes? It is easier to keep them happy and burden others. If a right-wing organisation has to be brought down, who will plan to improve the education sector and take on the wrath of the teachers who may take to the streets? One can only imagine decisions that have been postponed because Imran Khan and Ali Wazir have to be kept behind bars.
The list can go on and on. There is a price to be paid for this tough posturing. And what it really cost the hapless people of Pakistan will continue to be calculated for long after this period is over. For the moment, we can only guess what the eventual burden might be.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950303/too-many-battlefronts,Too many battlefronts - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"IT has been some years since Anatol Lieven
called
Pakistan a ‘hard country’, a phrase which didn’t really get much traction. It just didn’t carry enough negative connotations; the rest of the world preferred sobriquets such as ‘failed state’ or ‘the most dangerous country in the world’. It left most of us who live in Pakistan with the sense that we had a tendency to attract attention for all the wrong reasons. And whatever our image, it wasn’t going to be one highlighting our softer attributes.
Now, it seems, we ourselves are trying to create a tough brand. Of being known as hard, a powerful state which no one can ride roughshod over, be it enemies within Pakistan or external.
These are not mere words. Just over the recent week, a protest originating from Lahore was
not allowed to make its way to Islamabad
, a destination which has been overrun by many others in the past. This was followed by a
crackdown
on the TLP, which had announced the protest, combined with allegations of state violence leading to loss of life. And while, the TLP itself has been guilty of violence on more than one occasion, the pattern of the state’s reaction has now become familiar. In the past couple of years, there have been protests in different parts of the country where political parties such as the PTI as well as citizen rights movements such as the PTM or BYC have all alleged loss of life. Religio-political organisations such as the TLP were treated a bit differently but not anymore. Those who convey the master’s message claim that the party will now be disbanded.
Around the same time, Islamabad’s relations with Kabul are also at an all-time low. It seems as if the time for playing nice is over and if the terrorist attacks in Pakistan continue, Islamabad will inflict pain on Afghanistan to change its big, bad ways. If earlier the pain was inflicted through
refugee repatriation
or border controls, now there will be more — the
targeting of terrorists
based there and skirmishes on the border. Over the weekend, these tensions led to our Gulf brethren entering the fray to
soothe the two neighbours
. What a turnaround; once seen as the patrons of the Afghan Taliban, Pakistan now needs intermediaries to make nice with them.
Picking so many battles leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time.
And these battles are being fought at a time when there are reports aplenty of another aggression from India. Be it official or unofficial voices, or even some from across the border, there are warnings enough of unfinished business on the eastern border. And what if this happens at a time when the western border is also tense? Especially as it’s not just the borders which can pose a threat? The tensions with both the neighbours are closely linked to the deteriorating security situation in two provinces — Balochistan and KP. Pakistan’s view is that the eastern and western neighbours are encouraging infiltration of terrorists and providing them with the finances. And so serious is this external factor that the debate over how the discontent in these provinces has been feeding into the violence has been abandoned.
In the tough posturing with aggressive neighbours and militant groups, there is confidence that Punjab and Sindh are under control. At this time and age, the absence of a mass people’s movement and violence means all is well. And if in one province, the water issue has led to simmering anger and in the other the government’s legitimacy is under question, these are smaller problems, for repression or concessions (as in Sindh on the water issue and in Azad Kashmir) can lead to a sense of quiet.

IQAir
.
In past few years, air pollution has become one of the most pressing public health and environmental crises facing Pakistan. Various
cities
of the country, most notably
Lahore
, deal with smog especially in the winter months. The phenomenon is attributed mainly to industrial emissions,
vehicular pollution
,
stubble burning
and
air movement
.
Ranked the world’s third most polluted city yesterday,
Lahore
rose to the second spot today with an air quality index (AQI) reading of 234 at 11am, categorised as “very unhealthy”. The provincial capital trailed just behind New Delhi, which had an “hazardous” AQI of 489.
Karachi
recorded an AQI of 182 at 11am, falling in the “unhealthy” range and just barely behind Kuwait’s capital at 183. India’s Mumbai came in at fifth with an AQI of 169.

By 4pm, the AQI for Lahore had dropped to 154, placing it sixth on the list, while Karachi was still the third-most polluted city with an AQI of 165.
IQAir’s AQI is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). An AQI between 151 and 200 is considered “unhealthy”, one ranging from 201 to 300 is categorised “very unhealthy”, and any figure above 301 is “hazardous”.
According to IQAir, the AQI readings for Lahore and Karachi were the highest recorded so far this month.

At 11am in Lahore, concentration of the pollutant PM2.5 — cancer-causing microparticles small enough to enter the bloodstream — was measured at 158.8 microgrammes per cubic metre of air (μg/m³), 31.8 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) guidelines.
PM2.5 level in Karachi was recorded 100 µg/m³, 20 times the WHO’s annual guideline value.
IQAir advised residents in Lahore and Karachi to avoid outdoor exercise, run air purifiers and prioritise wearing masks. It also recommended closing all windows to avoid dirty air from outdoors.
Smog is
set to intensify
across Lahore and other parts of Punjab due to a combination of local emissions and pollutants carried by low-speed winds from India, following Diwali celebrations, according to the provincial government.
In a bid to combat smog, the Punjab government started water sprinkling operations from Sunday night and activated
anti-smog guns
in the most affected areas.
In Lahore, these measures were deployed across the city, including Karim Block, Allama Iqbal Town, Multan Road, Ravi Bridge, Shahdara Flyover, GT Road, Thokar Niaz Baig, and Upper Mall.
Besides local pollutants, winds blowing from India are also likely to play a role in worsening the situation over the week.
Separately, the Lahore police said yesterday it
arrested 83
people and registered 77 cases as part of its ongoing anti-smog operation.
Air pollution poses a hazardous risk to people’s health, with respiratory issues
witnessing a spike
during winter when smog intensifies. According to WHO Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo,

Senior Civil Judge Mubashir Hassan Chishti presided over the proceedings and directed that Gandapur — who did not show up today — be arrested and presented before the court.
The hearing was adjourned till October 28.
The case dates back to October 30, 2016, when Islamabad police
said they had recovered
five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol and three tear gas shells from then-KP revenue minister Gandapur’s car outside Bani Gala, where the residence of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan is located.
The incident had taken place against the backdrop of authorities preventing PTI supporters from reaching Bani Gala on Imran’s call to execute a plan to ‘lockdown’ the capital later on November 2.
Gandapur had
rejected
police claims, saying that two of the five assault rifles found on him were licensed while the others were official weapons provided to his security guards. He had also claimed that the teargas launcher and bottles of liquor were not his and that he had been carrying honey in the liquor bottle.
Subsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the capital’s Bhara Kahu police station.
Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times since over his non-appearance, including on

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
A statement from the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at Islamabad’s NIH said the latest case of poliovirus was detected in a 12-month-old boy from Ghari union council in Torghar, marking the second case in the district this year.
“With this detection, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 30 – including 19 from KP, nine from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” it said.
The statement added that during the month of September, the Pakistan Polio Programme collected 127 sewage samples across 87 districts in the country.
Of these, 81 samples tested negative for poliovirus, while 44 were found positive; two samples are currently under process in the laboratory, it added.
Balochistan reported 21 negative sample and two positive; Punjab reported 22 negative, 8 positive and one which was still under process; KP reported 24 negative and 10 positive; Sindh reported seven negative, 21 positive and one which was under process; Islamabad reported four negative and one positive; Azad Jammu and Kashmir reported three negative; and Gilgit-Baltistan reported one negative and one positive.
“While the overall trend indicates a decline in positive detections, reflecting the impact of recent high-quality vaccination campaigns, virus circulation persists in certain high-risk areas. These detections highlight the continued need for strong, targeted efforts to interrupt transmission,” the statement said.
It added that the Polio Eradication Initiative was intensifying efforts to sustain comprehensive vaccination coverage and ensure the “highest quality campaigns in vulnerable” areas.
The statement said that the fourth national polio vaccination campaign for 2025 was conducted last week, vaccinating over 44 million children, while the campaign in south KP was currently in
progress
.
In 2024, the country
reported
at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.",2025-10-21,Rukhsana Khan,670,0.00011

The matter gained traction as the proposed name is already the name of an opposition alliance led by Mehmood Khan Achakzai. The applicants, who also sought the allocation of a joint election symbol, included Pakistan Aman Tehreek Chairman Ali Sher Yousafzai, Pakistan Falahi Tehreek Chairman Fazal Aman Khan, and Pakistan Welfare Party Chairman Muhammad Farooq.
The TTAP — which saw the move as an attempt to take away its title and sabotage its resistance movement — had formed a legal team to defend its position before the ECP, with Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar appearing before the commission today.
The matter was heard by a three-member ECP bench headed by the member from Balochistan, Shah Mohammad Jatoi.
During the hearing, the Pakistan Falahi Tehreek chairman told the ECP that the parties had not applied for the registration of the alliance.
“We were informed that we had filed an application through a notice issued by the election commission,” he said.
At this, the ECP member from Punjab, Babar Hassan Bharwana, remarked, “We did not issue a notice ourselves; someone must have applied.”
He also called for a forensic analysis of the application, saying, “You should consult your legal adviser and apologise if you have applied by mistake.”
The ECP told the three parties to withdraw the application, warning that action would be taken against them otherwise.
For his part, Khokhar filed a request seeking the provision of records. Khokhar said that an opposition alliance had been formed under Achakzai’s leadership called the TTAP. He urged the ECP to not entertain the plea.
The ECP then sought detailed statements from the three applicants and said it would issue and appropriate order. Later, the applicants submitted handwritten requests seeking the withdrawal of their application.
Veteran politician Achakzai, who also heads his own Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), was made chairman of the TTAP, weeks after the February 8
general elections
. The PTI, PkMAP and Balochistan National Party-Mengal are among the major parties of the alliance.
The alliance alleges that the mandate of PTI was stolen and it does not acknowledge the present government as a genuine representative of the voters. The opposition alliance recently put on hold its countrywide public meetings and protests, mainly, in the wake of floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.
‘Space for opposition getting narrower’
Speaking to the media outside the ECP, Khokhar termed the application a “childish thought”.
“Space for the opposition in this country is growing narrower and narrower,” Khokhar said, decrying the move to steal the TTAP’s name.
Speaking about the opposition alliance, he said, “This has been underway for a long time … the largest opposition party, PTI is a part of it; the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen is also a part of it; Balochistan National Party’s Akhtar Mengal is also a part of it; other parties and civil society individuals are also a part of it.”
He also went on to say that such requests should not be entertained. “If we want to run this country in a better way, in an acceptable way where the rule of law governs, then we should refrain from these kind of requests,” he said.
“The three parties that came today — we didn’t even know who they were — they submitted their withdrawal application. But for the future … we are also clever, and we will not back off in the face of such efforts. We will continue to defend and promote our right to political opposition,” he said.",2025-10-21,Irfan Sadozai,945,0.000131
https://www.dawn.com/news/1950373/3-civilians-killed-in-muridke-operation-claims-punjab-minister,"3 civilians killed in Muridke operation, claims Punjab minister - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari claimed on Tuesday that three civilians were killed during the operation in
Muridke
that dispersed
Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan
(TLP) protesters.
The TLP, which began a protest march in
Lahore
earlier this month, was planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. The march and sit-in, which reached
Muridke
, quickly turned into violent clashes between protesters and police before the protesters were dispersed, leading to a
crackdown
on the party and its supporters.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore today, the Punjab information minister said “false stories” were being perpetuated about the operation in Muridke.
“Three civilians were martyred in Muridke. These were people who were passing by or standing off to the side,” she said, adding that 48 civilians and 110 police officers were also injured. Eighteen out of 110 have sustained firearm injuries, she said.
The minister also said that police vans had been stolen and eight were set on fire. Referring to “exclusive” footage of the clashes that was aired at the press conference, she said, “They brought trolleys full of bricks … and the sad thing is, they did all of this in the name of religion, Palestine, and Gaza.”
She also displayed footage of valuable items recovered from the residence of the party’s leader, saying, “1.920 kilograms of gold; 898g of silver; 69 branded watches, 28 gold bracelets … in the name of charity, they bring it back home,” she said.
She urged children “who love their faith” not to be taken in by groups that use it for political or financial gain, and requested parents to not send their children to be involved in such activities.
“Don’t be used in the political agendas of others,” she said. “Stories on social media are scripted.”
“We are not moving or transferring anyone’s grave or shrine,” she said, adding, “But to use that grave to collect charity, to gather people and provoke violence — the Punjab government won’t allow that.”
Bokhari said that all the accounts of those who financed terrorist groups were frozen and that those who financed them, or supported them on social media, would be prosecuted and charged with terrorism.
“No mosque is being demolished; what Muslim can even think of that?” she said, adding that the mosques and seminaries would be turned over to “righteous religious groups”.
The provincial information minister stressed that the government was “not against any sect”, but rather against “that mindset that makes people resort to violence”.
She further said that the government had now taken over 330 mosques that were under the TLP.
“We are not against any group, but this is for the country,” she said. “The loudspeakers will be used only for
azaan
and the mosques only for prayers.”
She also said that 223 seminaries of the TLP had been geotagged and details of them obtained, adding that they would soon be reopened and that most had already reopened.
“Six madressahs were built on government property, that had no records,” the minister pointed out, “and no one had the right to question it, because then a
fatwa-i-qatal
would have been announced.”
She said that those who had taken the law into their own hands and were responsible for the injuries and deaths of civilians and police would be prosecuted under anti-terror laws.
“Both the brothers are being traced; they have not been shot or arrested,” she said, referring to Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas. “They have fled, and we will arrest them soon.”
Bokhari also said that the decision to ban the TLP is expected in the next few days.
The minister added that the time was “now or never” for Pakistan to decide if it wanted to be a democratic and progressive Islamic country.
“The government has decided, now it is on the people.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1950374/smog-theatre-will-cannons-and-towers-clear-polluted-air,‘Smog theatre’: Will cannons and towers clear polluted air? - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"As Lahore gears up for another smog season, an imposing new fleet of green trucks is making rounds across the city. Branded as “Anti-Smog Guns”, they spray a fine mist into the air in hopes of settling pollution.
Launched under the banner of
Climate Resilient Punjab
, the fog cannons promise cleaner skies.
They look like action. Do they deliver?
The science says no. A 2023
study
from China tracked air along a road segment before and after a mist cannon passed. PM2.5 rose by up to 13 per cent about 25–35 minutes later, as the extra water accelerated chemistry that formed more fine particles. In other words, the cannon didn’t clean the air. It primed the air to make more pollution.
In Lahore, each
fog cannon
costs over Rs45 million, according to news reports. The machines were imported from China and formally handed over to the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a high-profile event attended by senior government leadership.
Running one unit continuously can consume up to 360,000 litres of water per day. Multiplied across 15 units (and possibly more to come), this represents a massive environmental and financial burden, especially in a water-stressed, smog-choked city.
The question then becomes: why invest in a solution that does not address the root causes of smog?
Lahore’s pollution comes from the familiar mix: exhaust from vehicles, industrial combustion, brick kilns, construction dust, open waste burning and seasonal crop fires.
Addressing these requires s
tronger regulation
, cleaner fuels, public transit investments and regional coordination with the agricultural sector. Not atmospheric firefighting.
Yet smog cannons persist because they look like action. Their towering presence and dramatic spray offer visual reassurance, especially when political pressure mounts.
They are, in effect, optics over outcomes. A show of effort rather than a solution. They are, effectively, ‘smog theatre’.
Smog towers were last year’s spectacle. Installed with fanfare, they failed to dent Lahore’s ambient particulate matter, just as evaluations from experts warned they would. Different machine, same theatre.
Pakistan deserves better. Lahore deserves better. We need evidence-based air quality policy, not spectacles. The resources spent on fog cannons and smog towers would be far more effective if redirected toward emission controls, the release of real-time air quality data, cleaner fuels and public communication about air pollution risks.
The air doesn’t just need to look clean — it needs to be clean.
The true crisis runs much deeper. In 2024, Lahore had zero clean air days under World Health Organisation (WHO) standards.
Its annual average PM2.5 concentration was 104.6 microgrammes per cubic meter, more than three times the Punjab NEQS legal limit and 21 times the WHO guideline.
This level of exposure reduces average life expectancy by seven years. This is not a seasonal phenomenon. It is a systemic failure with multiple sources.
China’s success offers a better model. As Ma Jun writes in
The Economics of Air Pollution in China
, authorities began by developing detailed emissions inventories, conducting cost-benefit analyses and targeting specific polluting sectors with enforceable regulation.
This data-driven approach helped Beijing significantly reduce smog within a decade.
Pakistan can do the same.
But only if we stop misting the symptoms and start making policy around the causes.
We need rigorous enforcement of diesel vehicle standards, identification of key emitters through real-world emissions testing, industrial emission controls, brick kiln modernisation and investment in clean public transit.
Until we confront the sources of pollution head-on, no amount of mist will clear the air.",2025-10-21,Abid Omar,939,0.00013

A notification issued by the commission today said the assembly’s tenure was to expire on November 24 and it was the commission’s constitutional duty to organise and conduct general elections and local government elections in GB, along with making all necessary arrangements to ensure that they were conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law, while safeguarding the process from corrupt practices.
“The general public has expressed genuine concerns about appointments, upgradations, and transfers of government officers and officials across various departments during this sensitive pre-election period. These actions have given rise to apprehensions that they may be politically motivated, potentially weakening public trust in the fairness and integrity of the election process.”
“After careful consideration of these concerns, the GB Election Commission believes that such appointments, upgradations, and posting/transfers carried out during the election period risk being viewed as attempts to gain political advantage. This perception could weaken public trust in the neutrality, impartiality, and overall integrity of the electoral process,” the election commission added.
“The commission has also observed growing public concern, regarding the diversion of development funds from approved projects to politically motivated schemes, which clearly constitutes another form of pre-poll influence and has the potential to distort the level playing field among candidates,” the notification said.
It added that it became necessary for the commission to exercise its lawful powers to maintain neutrality and fairness in governance affairs in order to uphold public confidence in the electoral process, to ensure equal opportunity for all candidates, to protect the sanctity and impartiality of the forthcoming general elections, and to prevent abuse of state resources for electoral advantage.
The GB chief election commissioner (CEC) thus ordered that all forms of recruitment or appointment in any regional department, organisation or institution were banned with immediate effect except recruitments made through the Federal Public Service Commission and cases where tests/interviews were already completed by today or where recruitment was urgently needed in the public interest.
The GB CEC further ordered that no new development scheme, community-based initiative or announcement-based project should be awarded, processed or initiated in any form until the next elections were held and a new government assumed office.
Furthermore, any diversion of funds already allocated to development projects in GB was strictly prohibited, with all diverted funds to remain frozen with immediate effect.
“No transfer or posting of government officers/officials shall be made except in cases of genuine public interest, and only after obtaining prior approval/NOC (no-objection certificate) from the GB Election Commission upon submission of a formal proposal.
“No government functionary or elected representative shall announce or inaugurate any new development scheme or project during the election period.
“All development funds relating to local government institutions in GB shall stand frozen with immediate effect until the official announcement of election results. However, in exceptional cases involving extreme urgency or matters of overriding public importance, utilisation of such funds may be permitted strictly upon obtaining prior approval/NOC from the GB Election Commission,” the notification further ordered.
It directed that funds allocated to ongoing schemes should continue to be utilised strictly in accordance with the approved Planning Manual and  Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules without any alteration or modification.
The notification further stated that no creation, alteration or announcement of new administrative units, sub-divisions or similar territorial entities should be made. during the election period under any circumstances.
Listing off more directions, the commission further ordered: “No proposal for the creation of new posts shall be submitted to the GB Finance Department. Likewise, no case of re-designation, up-gradation, concurrence or conveyance of new creation shall be processed by the GB Finance Department or the Services & General Administration Department. However, genuine cases duly justified may be considered only upon obtaining prior approval/NOC from the GB Election Commission.”
“Release of additional funds for new maintenance works is prohibited except in cases of extreme emergency in the public interest, duly justified to and only after obtaining NOC/approval from the GB Election Commission.”
“No new policy, directive, rule or regulation shall be issued or implemented after the issuance of this notification until the formation of the next provincial government.”

boiled over into
outright fighting
, along with
charged statements
from India’s civil-military leadership.
The military’s top brass had warned India earlier this month that any “imaginary new normal” its leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”.
A press release issued from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said the army chief interacted with participants of the 17th National Workshop Balochistan at the General Headquarters.
“The COAS reiterated that while Pakistan seeks regional peace and stability, any violation of its territorial integrity, direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response to safeguard the lives and well-being of its citizens,” the ISPR said.
The military’s media wing added that the army chief underscored that “Indian sponsored proxies”
Fitna al-Hindustan
and
Fitna al-Khawarij
propagated “anti-people and anti-development agendas with malicious intent to perpetrate violence”.
He reaffirmed that all necessary actions were being taken to pursue them and rid Balochistan of their menace.
Fitna al-Khawarij
is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as
Fitna al-Hindu­stan
— a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
“The COAS, during his interaction with the participants, remarked that Balochistan is the pride of Pakistan, endowed with highly vibrant, resilient and patriotic people who are its true wealth. He also highlighted the federal and provincial governments’ development initiatives, being undertaken to uplift the socio-economic landscape of Balochistan through a people-centric approach. He emphasised upon realisation of the immense economic potential of the province for the benefit of the people of Balochistan.”
“Acknowledging the constructive role of civil society, particularly in engaging and empowering the youth, the COAS underscored their pivotal role in sustainable development, negating vested political agendas in the interest of long-term prosperity in Balochistan,” the ISPR added.
On Saturday, the army chief had
cautioned
India that there was “no space for war in a nuclearised environment” as he hailed Pakistan’s “clear victory” during the May conflict with the neighbouring country.
He had also urged the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence and called on the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”.
“Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he had asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an
attack
in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “
Operation Bunyanum Marsoos
”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a
US-led push
helped broker a ceasefire.",2025-10-21,Nadir Guramani,952,0.000131
https://www.dawn.com/news/1950387/shrinking-habitats-rising-poaching-push-pakistans-bears-towards-the-brink,"Shrinking habitats, rising poaching push Pakistan’s bears towards the brink - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","A combination of threats, from shrinking habitats and
increased human-animal conflict
to poaching and environmental degradation, has accelerated the decline of Pakistan’s bear population over the past decade, according to local wildlife experts.
Although no comprehensive scientific surveys have been conducted to determine the exact numbers of bears in the country, experts estimate a 20-30 per cent decline in their population over the past 10 years.
Muhammad Kabir, head of the Wildlife Ecology Lab at the University of Haripur, said that while a few regions in Pakistan still have healthy bear populations, the overall trend remains worrying.
“So much so, bears have become locally extinct from several areas, where they once were believed to have been in ‘good numbers’,” Kabir told
Anadolu
.
Pakistan is home to two species of bears — the Himalayan brown bear and the Asiatic black bear.
The black bear is further divided into two subspecies — the Himalayan black bear (U. t. laniger), found in the temperate forests of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the Balochistan black bear (U. t. gedrosianus), which inhabits the arid montane regions of Balochistan, particularly around Khuzdar and Kalat districts and adjoining areas along the Iran border.
“Bears have been facing multiple threats, which has put them in the list of highly vulnerable species in Pakistan,” Kabir said.
He cited habitat loss, deforestation, expanding infrastructure, agricultural encroachment and illegal poaching as the leading causes of decline. Human-wildlife conflict, he added, is further exacerbating the situation.
Faizan Ahmad, a researcher at the Pakistan Forest Institute, Peshawar, said the Asiatic black bear — once widespread across Asia’s forests — was now under severe pressure in the country.
“Its population is shrinking, fragmented and increasingly drawn into human-modified landscapes where resource scarcity, habitat degradation, and human–wildlife conflict intersect,” Ahmad told
Anadolu
.
He added that as human settlements expand and forest ecosystems become more fragmented, bears are often forced into conflict-prone areas, threatening both conservation efforts and rural livelihoods.
Local extinction
There are no official nationwide population surveys for bears in Pakistan, but indirect indicators such as habitat degradation, increased human-bear conflict and poaching reports point to a steady decline.
Based on recent field data, Ahmad said it was reasonable to estimate a 20-30pc population decline in Asiatic black bears over the past decade.
Currently, around 150-200 Himalayan brown bears survive in small, isolated populations across northern Pakistan. The most stable population is found in GB’s Deosai Plateau, where conservation efforts have led to population growth in recent years.
Deosai National Park remains the only protected area in Pakistan where a regular census is conducted to monitor bear numbers. A smaller population also exists in Khunjerab National Park near the border with China.
The forested districts of Swat, Kohistan, Upper Dir and Shangla in KP; AJK’s Neelum Valley and GB’s Diamer district host the Himalayan black bear.
According to Kabir, the combined population of Himalayan and Balochistan black bears ranges between 1,000 and 1,500 individuals.
“Black bear has vanished from several parts of KP, particularly Ayubia region over the past three to four decades,” he said.
Ahmad added that national estimates suggest fewer than 2,500 bears remain across Pakistan, with the Balochistan black bear population likely reduced to fewer than 50 mature individuals.
“This subspecies is now critically endangered in Pakistan and among the least studied large carnivores in the country,” he maintained.
Medicinal value
Despite legal protection, bear cubs are
still poached
, particularly in early spring when dens are more accessible.
“Local accounts describe poachers lighting fires at den entrances to force mothers and cubs out; the mother is killed, and cubs are sold for bear dancing or bear-baiting,” Ahmad said, referring to the cruel practice where bears are chained and forced to fight dogs for public entertainment.
In addition to illegal trade, bears are hunted in autumn for their pelts and fat. Kabir explained that bear bile (Xiongdan in Chinese) — the dried gallbladder of the Asiatic black bear — has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for thousands of years.
He said it is believed to treat ailments such as liver disorders, fever, digestive problems and inflammation. Bear bile contains ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a compound also used in modern medicine to treat certain liver diseases and dissolve gallstones.
However, the extraction of bile and gallbladders is highly controversial due to its cruelty and devastating impact on wild populations. Conservationists and animal welfare groups have long called for synthetic or plant-based alternatives to bear bile products.
Ahmad emphasised that conservation measures must include habitat protection and restoration, conflict mitigation, den protection, community engagement and long-term monitoring.
“Community-based conflict mitigation strategies, such as compensation schemes, use of non-lethal deterrents and crop protection measures are essential to shift from conflict to coexistence,” he said.
He added that engaging local communities in conservation not only safeguards camera traps and monitoring infrastructure but also encourages local stewardship of wildlife resources.
Ecological threat
Azan Karam, a Swat-based wildlife expert, warned that Pakistan’s declining bear population poses a serious ecological threat because bears play a crucial role as both keystone and umbrella species.
“Its presence supports essential ecosystem functions such as seed dispersal, carcass scavenging and insect regulation, all of which contribute to forest regeneration, nutrient cycling, and overall ecosystem health,” Karam told
Anadolu
.
He said a reduction in bear numbers could disrupt these natural processes, leading to long-term ecological imbalance.
“Moreover, as an umbrella species, conserving the black bear means protecting large, diverse habitats that also support many other wildlife species. Its decline signals broader biodiversity loss across Pakistan’s temperate forests,” he added.",2025-10-21,Anadolu Agency,1587,0.000179

The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes
military operations
, which tribal people also resist as they often lead to
displacements.
The remarks come a day after the KP CM
blamed
the federal government’s “flawed policy” for the resurgence of terrorism in KP, during his first official high-level meeting since
assuming
office on October 15, after the former CM Ali Amin Gandapur
resigned
earlier this month on the directions of party chairman Imran Khan.

He alleged that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other Constitutional rights”. He also criticised the Centre for providing KP Police “defective and old” armoured vehicles and asked that the vehicles be recalled.
Addressing the media today, the state minister took exception to the KP CM’s earlier remarks and stated, “the operation you are rejecting may serve you well politically, but it will also lead to loss of lives, for which you alone will be held responsible.”
Talal expressed disappointment that the “fight against terrorism and sacrifices made by soldiers were being overshadowed by politics”.
“You don’t want to fight against terrorists, you are scared, you have political motives,” said Talal, alleging that the PTI-led provincial government was choosing not to fight the war against terrorism, “so they could use it to blackmail the government.”
Citing Article 148 of the Constitution, the minister warned that “provinces can not unilaterally make any decision which affects the rest of the country”.
“The fight against terrorism is the entire country’s fight,” maintained the state minister for interior.
On the matter of the CM’s recent appointment, Talal said that it was a deliberate decision to elect someone “who would not hesitate to prioritise political point scoring and his chairman’s narrative over matters of national interests and his responsibilities as the chief minister”.
Responding to KP CM’s comments about “defective bulletproof vehicles”, the minister maintained that “it was unfortunate that CM Afridi was returning necessary equipment to make the Centre look weak for political point scoring”.
“If you did not like the bulletproof cars, then maybe give your own instead,” he said, stressing that the KP govt was “not fighting a war but only wasting time and creating unnecessary drama.”
A day earlier, the minister had called the move “immature” and a setback in the fight against terrorism, the
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)
reported.
“What’s unfortunate is that the police officers in KP are fighting terrorists without any equipment,” he said, adding that the provincial govt was “refusing to stand with them.”
He also claimed that there was a “different agenda” at play, stating that “changing the chief minister was never about benefiting the people”.
Although the federal government in August
ruled out
a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the
National Action Plan.
Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.",2025-10-21,Dawn.com,875,0.000126
https://www.dawn.com/news/1950389/two-sc-judges-warn-new-code-of-conduct-will-restrict-judicial-freedom-create-avenues-for-control,"Two SC judges warn new code of conduct will restrict judicial freedom, create avenues for control - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","Supreme Court’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar have said that changes recently made to the Code of Conduct for superior court judges will restrict judicial freedom and create avenues for internal and external control, it emerged on Tuesday.
On October 18, the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) approved
far-reaching amendments
to the Code of Conduct, barring superior court judges from engaging in public controversy or media interaction, particularly on political questions, and introducing new restrictions on social and diplomatic activity.
Chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the meeting was attended virtually by Justices Shah and Akhtar. Lahore High Court (LHC) Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and her Islamabad counterpart Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar attended in person.
In the latest letter penned to the SJC chair and its members, Justices Shah and Akhtar said they had submitted their unsigned written comments at the start of the meeting in a letter dated October 17.
The duo then revised those comments to incorporate the “unfortunate and constitutionally inappropriate development” of the
National Judicial Policy-Making Committee
(NJPMC) discussing the Code of Conduct when the matter “lies solely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the SJC”.
“These proposals, if adopted, will restrict judicial freedom, transform an open and collegial institution into a closed and hierarchical one, and create avenues for control, both internal and external,” Justices Shah and Akhtar said.
Among the various tweaks, the judges strongly objected to the amendment made to the Code of Conduct’s Article V, under which judges are prohibited from speaking, writing, debating or commenting publicly on controversial matters and on political questions, even where questions of law arise.
They also took exception to the insertion of Article XIX, which provides an “institutional response” for judges facing any “influence”, under which they will report to their respective chief justice, who will then inform the CJP.
“In the current political and institutional climate — where pressures on the judiciary are widely perceived — such a mechanism can be manipulated to suppress legitimate whistleblowing by judges who resist external interference,” the judges wrote.
On the incorporation of the 2003 SJC Resolutions/Guidelines, which includes a bar on attending social, cultural, political and diplomatic functions, the judges said it “reduces the judiciary’s visibility and connection to the community”.
Another clause treats the soliciting of conference or meeting invitations from foreign or international bodies as misconduct. The judges criticised this as well, noting that judges attend such seminars to “enhance comparative learning and professional competence-activities that strengthen judicial capacity, not diminish it”.
Justices Shah and Akhtar detailed 10 “weaknesses and risks” posed by the amendments to Article V alone, which is related to judges’ freedom of speech.
“The phrases ‘public controversy’ and ‘political questions’ are undefined and could encompass nearly every matter of constitutional or legal significance,” they pointed out.
They expressed the apprehension that the “fear of being accused of ‘public controversy’ will compel judges to remain silent on matters of constitutional importance, even outside the courtroom”.
“This self-censorship undermines intellectual growth within the judiciary and weakens the development of constitutional jurisprudence.”
On the ban on “any interaction with the media”, the judges said it “amounts to a gag order, imposing total silence and insulating the institution from public scrutiny”.
On the new rule for judges to “not cause any judicial or administrative matter to be discussed publicly”, they said it shields the judiciary from external accountability and disables judges from defending the institution publicly.
Justices Shah and Akhtar also cautioned that the provision “could be selectively invoked against outspoken judges, particularly those critical of executive
overreach or internal mismanagement”, creating a “chilling effect” and opening the door to disciplinary misuse.
The judges further said: “In Pakistan’s fragile democratic environment, such a clause can be easily weaponised by executive or establishment forces through compliant leadership to silence independent voices within the judiciary.”
“During ‘testing times’ for democracy, judicial independence requires openness, moral courage-not silence or conformity.”
Postponement sought as IHC CJ seniority, 26th Amendment under challenge
Justices Shah and Akhtar also listed multiple reservations regarding the procedure of the amendments’ approval.
The judges recalled that in a letter dated October 13,  they had “proposed that the present [SJC] meeting be postponed, or the Council be re-constituted, given that the seniority and status of Honourable Justice Sarfraz Dogar in his high court are
under challenge
” before the SC.
“The outcome of that case will directly determine his eligibility to serve as a member of the Supreme Judicial Council.”
Justices Shah and Akhtar also highlighted that the 26th Amendment
remains under challenge
before the SC.
“Until that matter is decided, the status of the chairperson and one of the members is sub judice. Constitutional propriety therefore requires that no amendments to the Code be undertaken until that issue is settled,” they said.
The earlier October 13 letter stated, “While we would obviously not wish to comment on
sub judice
matters, it goes without saying that there is always an inherent uncertainty involved in any litigation, no matter how sanguine one may be about the outcome.”
It added that the decision in that case could directly affect Justice Dogar’s membership of the SJC, and consequently the council’s composition. The judge had also suggested it would be appropriate “if Justice Dogar recuses himself, then the council may proceed with its meetings/proceedings”.
“The decision in those proceedings can directly affect the Hon’ble Judge’s membership of, and consequently the composition of the Council.
They noted that since “three chief justices participating today (October 18) are ex officio members of both the NJPMC and the SJC, their participation in approving the amendments at the NJPMC meant that the majority of the SJC had effectively predecided the matter before it was even placed before the Council”.",2025-10-21,Umer Mehtab,1623,0.000182

Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about the lack of access to the party founder and how family, friends and party leaders are hindered from meeting him.
Afridi, who was elected as the provincial chief minister last week, was
denied a meeting
with Imran during a visit to the prison on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, he said he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran and seeking his input.
He claimed he had officially notified the Punjab government and the federal government of his plan to visit Adiala, but received no response, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not reply to his subsequent request, made during a phone call, to facilitate a meeting with Imran. He approached the Islamabad High Court on Friday,
seeking permission
to meet Imran.
Questioned about the matter in an interview on
DawnNewsTV
show ‘Doosra Rukh’, Rehman said: “I hope this meeting will take place in the coming days. The federal government has asked the provincial government to arrange this so the cabinet there (in KP) can be formed.”
Asked again whether the Centre had issued a direction for the meeting to the Punjab government, Rehman clarified that while an order could not be given since the provincial governments were autonomous, the prime minister had “urged” the provincial authorities and the federal government had also requested to “do this as soon as possible”.
Rehman added that as per his information, the Punjab government was devising a mechanism and fulfilling all “cordial formalities”, adding that the meeting would be “held soon”.
Speaking
during Monday’s KP Assembly session, CM Afridi said that he wrote letters to the chief justice of Pakistan and federal and provincial governments and even petitioned the Islamabad High Court (IHC) for ensuring his meeting with Imran, but to no avail.

Speaking at a judicial conference in Muzaffarabad, the CJP said it was heartening to witness the “spirit of judicial fraternity between Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK)” and extended “full constitutional [and] institutional support” from the Supreme Court to the AJK judiciary.
“I earnestly urge my brother judges and my respected bar members of [AJK] to keep three foundational fundamentals in mind in progressing with their future,” CJP Afridi said.
“I earnestly state, firstly, it is neither us sitting on the bench, nor for the worthy, respected bar members standing on the roster, but the litigant whose interest must always remain supreme.”
He added that secondly, the relationship between the bench and the bar “should always be cordial, constructive and considered”.
“Mind you, without this cohesion between the two pillars, there can be no guarantee for preserving the rule of law or ensuring any reform to go forward,” CJP Afridi emphasised.
“Thirdly, and finally … technology has to be integrated in the justice delivery process. Only then can the ultimate aim be achieved,” he added. “What is the ultimate end? [For] justice delivery to become efficient, transparent, and above all, citizen-centric.”
CJP Afridi added that Supreme Court Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar was committed to supporting the AJK judiciary’s automation.
“In any respect that you require, we are there and we stand ready to share experiences, extend technical cooperation and jointly build a future where the quality and accessibility of justice is strengthened across the board,” the CJP stated.
Earlier this week, the CJP stated that the Supreme Court had plans to use
artificial intelligence
(AI) to categorise cases for fixation, adding that 61,000 files will be digitally screened under a project that will be completed within six months.
“We all talk about technology, we all talk about AI to be utilised for enhancing the justice delivery system,” Justice Afridi said. “Yes, technology is necessary. Yes, AI has to be utilised.

reports
of a mobile SIM data leak.
Media reports claimed that the data of all SIM holders, including Interior Minister Naqvi, was up for sale, with mobile location information priced at Rs500, call and data records at Rs2,000, and details of foreign trips at Rs5,000.
A couple of months ago, the National Cyber Emer­gency Response Team of Pakistan (PKCERT) iss­ued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan were stolen in a global data breach, urging people to take immediate protective measures.

These are the words of five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges who have moved the Supreme Court (SC) against the IHC itself, and its top judge.
Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Tariq Mah­mood Jahangiri, Saman Rafat and Ejaz Ishaq Khan have filed similar petitions in the country’s apex court. Their applications also outline the events that led to them making the move.
Here’s how these events unfolded, as detailed in their pleas.
It began in Justice Aamer Farooq’s tenure
During the tenure of the previous IHC chief justice, now Supreme Court Justice Aamer Farooq, the petitioners had raised the “issue of executive interference in judicial work and attempts to pressurise the judges to influence judicial outcomes in certain cases”.
“These serious concerns” were first brought to the knowledge of the then-chief justice of the IHC, informally, in a meeting of all the judges of the high court. The same concerns were brought to the attention of the then-chief justice of Pakistan, Umar Ata Bandial, during a meeting at his residence in May 2023, and the petitioners continued to raise the issue, along with other administrative matters, in several meetings with the then-IHC CJ.
According to the petitioners, these issues had a “serious impact on the administration of justice and independence of the judiciary”.
“However, no response that would adequately address the serious concerns was forthcoming.”
Subsequently, six IHC judges “felt constrained to formally notify the then chief justice, through a letter dated May 10, 2023, regarding the attempts to assert pressure to influence judicial outcomes”. These judges also included the ones who petitioned the SC on Friday.
The six judges had recommended to the then-IHC CJ to initiate appropriate proceedings under Article 204 of the Constitution — which deals with contempt of court — to address the matter.
“No proceedings were, however, initiated.”
In this connection, the six IHC judges also met the senior-most judges of the SC — then-CJP Bandial, then-senior puisne judge of the apex court, Qazi Faez Isa, and Justice Ijazul Ahsan — the same month “in another attempt to seek appropriate response from within the institution”.
“However, the attempts to pressurise and intimidate the judges continued and were reported to the relevant offices within the institution.”
Then, in March last year, an
SC ruling
set aside the dismissal of former IHC senior puisne judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui. He had been
dismissed
as a judge of the high court in October 2018 by the Supreme Judicial Council  (SJC) — which decides on cases of misconduct of the judges of the superior judiciary — over a fiery speech he had delivered that year at the Rawalpindi Bar Association targeting a security institution.
In his speech, Justice Siddiqui had accused Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of influencing court proceedings and ‘forming benches of its choice’.
In view of the SC’s 2024 ruling and “continued interference by the executive branch in the affairs of the Islamabad High Court,” the six judges had also approached the SJC members and SC judges to “seek guidance on the duty of a judge to report and respond to executive interference through their
letter
dated March 25, 2024”.
In April, the SC
took suo motu
notice of the matter, and in the first hearing, the SC directed all stakeholders, including the high courts, to furnish their proposals “as to what should be the institutional response and mechanism to address the issues like the ones raised in the letter.”
But, instead of convening a full court meeting to deliberate and discuss the proposals, then-IHC CJ Farooq “deemed it appropriate to only circulate the order and seek proposals”, the judges regret.
Subsequently, Justices Arbab Tahir, Babar Sattar and Saman Rafat were “constrained” to write letters to the then-CJ, urging him to convene a full court
meeting for consultation between members of a collegiate body, as opposed to merely circulating the order, and seeking proposals.
“A full court meeting of the IHC was thereafter convened on April 23, 2024, wherein it was unanimously decided that a formal reporting mechanism and appropriate remedial action shall be taken in cases of any executive interference.”
The proposals were also submitted to the SC, but the matter remains “pending and no substantial proceedings have been conducted since last year”.
‘Takeover of the IHC’
In the days following this development, “the takeover of Islamabad High Court” by way of
transfer of judges
from the provincial high courts to IHC was initiated, and already serving judges of the IHC were “deprived” of their “due seniority”. The transferred judges included incumbent IHC CJ Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar.
This move impacted the IHC’s seniority list, leading to Dogar’s appointment to the top post.
Keeping in mind their code of conduct and comity of judges, the petitioner judges once again reached out to the then-IHC CJ to express reservations
and concerns regarding any transfer with the clear intent to “penalise the already serving judges” of the IHC.
Some of the petitioner judges also spoke to the then-chief justice of Pakistan, and voiced their concerns regarding such transfers and the “deleterious effect” they may have on the IHC and its independence. These transfers were carried out with “indecent haste”, which “forced” the petitioner judges to formally write to all relevant chief justices and ask them to hold “meaningful consultation” in line with Article 200 of the Constitution. This provision of the Constitution deals with the transfer of high court judges.
The chief justices were also asked to advise the president against any such transfer that would “erode the independence” of the IHC.
“Nevertheless, three judges from different provincial high courts …
were transferred to the IHC right before the elevation of the then-chief justice of the IHC.
“Immediately after the transfer process was purportedly completed, the then-chief justice of the IHC issued a revised roster and seniority list on February 3, 2025,” the petition notes.
Then, during a meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan on February 10, convened to consider elevations of judges of high courts to the SC, then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq was nominated as a judge of the country’s apex court.
Two days later, President Asif Zardari notified his appointment and CJ Dogar was appointed as the acting IHC CJ, “after having spent not even two weeks” at the Islamabad High Court.
“Left with no other remedy, the petitioner judges were constrained to challenge the transfer of three judges and the revised seniority before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.”
The SC issued a
short order
on their plea on June 19, remanding the issue of seniority to the president. This order, however, was challenged through an intra-court appeal in the apex court. But “detailed reasons” for the SC ruling on June 19 are still awaited, and the subsequent appeals are yet to be fixed.
These events also led to the “ouster of senior-most judges of the Islamabad High Court from the administration of the Court and unlawful adoption of the Islamabad High Court Practice and Procedure Rules, 2025,” the judges say.
“The intent behind the transfer became apparent immediately when, in complete violation of the applicable rules and the practice of the court”, a crucial administration committee of the IHC was reconstituted to comprise Justices Aamer Farooq, Dogar and Khadim Hussain Soomro. Notably, among them, Justices Dogar and Soomro were newly transferred to the IHC then.
“Justice Dogar, at number 15 in the Lahore High Court, was a long way off from serving on the administration committee under the Rules and Orders of the Lahore High Court. Similarly, Justice Soomro, appointed as an additional judge as recently as April 14, 2023, was at seniority number 26, in the Sindh High Court, Karachi, but was made a member of the administration committee in the IHC.
“In short, immediately after their transfers, Justices Dogar and Soomro were handed control of the administration of the IHC.”
Earlier in February, Justice Babar Sattar had also written to the IHC registrar. Citing news reports, he had noted that the rules determining the composition of administration committee had been amended. The same month, Justice Saman Rafat also sought information about the reported amendments.
It was emphasised that the power to amend or promulgate rules applicable to the high court vests with the high court, as defined in Article 202 of the Constitution.
“Any amendment to the rules without the approval of the full court is unconstitutional and illegal.”
Days later, the IHC registrar “asserted” that the IHC Practice and Procedure Rules had been approved by the administration committee and were at the publication stage.
This led to more letters by Justice Rafat, to the IHC registrar and all IHC judges. In her letters, she emphasised that under the Constitution, only a full court was empowered to adopt new rules or changes to the applicable rules.
“Since no full court meeting has been convened for this purpose, any purported amendment adoption is illegal.”
Upon receiving no response, she sought an update on the matter on April 24, but, in “complete disregard of the law, the Constitution and settled practice”, the IHC registrar circulated a letter stating that the Practice and Procedure
Rules, 2025 had been published through a gazette notification dated February 18, and that the file had been placed before the CJ for approval.
“The Practice and Procedure Rules were purportedly adopted, approved and published without any approval of the full court and even after publication in the gazette, the judges of the Islamabad High Court had to wait for chief justice’s approval to receive a copy.
“For months, the petitioner judges’ efforts to seek information regarding the rules being adopted or amended was met with deafening silence,” the petitions read.
The Practice and Procedure Rules and the Islamabad High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2025 were placed before a full court months after their adoption, “when the chief justice of the Islamabad High Court felt assured that he had the majority for, after-the-fact, endorsement in [the] full court. Both sets of rules were then endorsed by a majority of six to five votes without any deliberation”.
At the time the copy of the Practice and Procedure Rules was circulated, it became apparent that the rules were purportedly notified on February 7 after approval by and under the instruction of the “illegally constituted” administration committee, comprising the then-chief justice, who was scheduled to be considered for elevation to the SC within 72 hours, and two transferred judges who had assumed charge of the IHC merely 72 hours before approving the rules.
“The petitioner judges, nevertheless, welcomed the long overdue convening of the full court meeting by the chief justice and hoped that it may be an opportunity to raise and discuss the striking issues relating to dispensation of justice by the Islamabad High Court.
“These attempts were stymied during the meeting.
“The conduct of the chief justice and his approach to institutional consultation left the petitioner judges horrified, who also declared that even the minutes of the full court meeting would not be shared with the judges. Consequently, some of the petitioner judges were constrained to write dissenting notes to document their opinion regarding the approval of the Practice and Procedure
Rules in particular, and the manner in which the meeting was conducted in general.”
CJ Dogar’s ‘misuse of administrative powers’
It was in these circumstances that Justice Dogar assumed the role of the IHC CJ. In this position, he would later use his administrative powers to “render the petitioner judges dysfunctional [and] undermine the independence of judiciary and credibility of the Islamabad High Court,” the judges say.
Justice Dogar, since assuming charge as the IHC CJ, “has consistently used administrative powers in violation of settled principles of comity of judges and judicial independence to render the petitioner judges, who challenged his
transter and seniority, dysfunctional”.
“The chief justice, in complete disregard of the settled law by the Supreme Court, has repeatedly used administrative powers to restrict some of the petitioner judges from exercising their judicial functions and powers, and to interfere with the discharge of their judicial functions.”
“Under Chief Justice Dogar’s watch, the office has refused to issue cause lists in breach of judicial orders and has transferred part-heard matters from the docket of one court to another without such powers vesting in the chief justice.
“Chief Justice Dogar has used his administrative power to reconstitute benches and transfer cases being adjudicated from the bench seized of them to another.”
“Chief Justice Dogar continues to use his power to issue the roster of sitting judges to render senior judges dysfunctional. Chief Justice Dogar has constituted divisional benches headed by junior judges and has relieved senior judges of such responsibility, including the senior puisne judge, who is no longer part of any divisional bench.”
“Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz can no longer preside over single benches, and the cases pending in their dockets, including part-heard cases, have been arrogated to other judges. The purported excuse used to achieve this purpose is a policy decision taken in a meeting of the National Judicial Policy Making Committee to create a Commercial Litigation Corridor within high courts.”
“Chief Justice Dogar has used administrative powers in a manner that lacks transparency in fixation of cases and bench constitution. There are no objective criteria guiding the composition of benches. IHC cause lists manifest arbitrary marking of cases. As against the high court rules that vest the function of marking cases in the office of the deputy registrar, all cases are fixed under the instructions of the chief justice.”
The petitioner judges say they have repeatedly raised the issue of bench formation and fixation of cases “for years now”. However, despite repeated efforts, the issue has remained unaddressed and the CJ continues to exercise powers regarding bench formation and fixation of cases “unilaterally without any specified objective framework and criteria”.
“While exercising administrative authority in an opaque manner that impacts which judges hear what cases, Chief Justice Dogar refuses to engage in a conversation regarding the need for an objective framework to evaluate the performance of judges. [The] Islamabad High Court instead engages in issuing skewed statistics regarding the discharge of judicial work.
“These statistics are designed to cultivate an impression that some judges work efficiently, while others do not work at all. These statistics are issued
without any regard to the nature (and number) of cases marked to the performing judges versus others, and the nature, quality and length of orders that make up the disposal figures.”
“Chief Justice Dogar, has opted to assume powers to transform the chief justice’s office into a monocracy. He has appropriated the power backed by no law to issue a circular requiring judges to seek an NOC (no-obejction certificate) from the chief justice to travel out of the country. Neither the Constitution nor the law vests such rule-making power in the office of the chief justice to lord over his peers,” the petitions state.
“While the right to seek earned leave remains an entitlement under the presidential order regulating the terms and conditions of service of judges, to hold that the leave cannot be sought except during summer or winter holidays is tantamount to suspending a statutory entitlement. And to require judges to seek an NOC for travel abroad even during holidays or while a judge is on leave is plain absurd apart from being unconstitutional.”
“A circular has also been issued barring individual court’s from uploading final judgements on the website of the IHC as a “means of controlling public access to judgements”.
“Chief Justice Dogar has transformed the office of chief justice into an autocracy, in an effort to reduce the judiciary to a regiment. Such actions undermine judicial independence,” which is essential for the discharge of adjudicatory duties.
Regarding the subordinate judiciary, the petitioner judges have raised the issue of failure to exercise effective supervision and control over lower courts.
“The Islamabad district judiciary, staffed largely by deputationists, resembles
the game of musical chairs, with judges on deputation enjoying no security of tenure. Chief Justice Dogar has taken affirmative steps to ensure that the Islamabad district judiciary remains a rag-tag ensemble, the members of which can be shunted back to their parent departments if they fall out of line.”
Then, the exercise of administrative powers by Chief Justice Dogar is also marred by conflict of interest, the judges believe.
As the competent authority under the Protection against Harassment at Workplace Act, 2010, Justice Saman Rafat recently constituted an inquiry committee after receiving
complaint
by a female lawyer against Justice Dogar.
“Acting in his own cause, the very same day, Chief Justice Dogar
recalled
the notification appointing Justice Rafat as the competent authority to administer the Protection against Harassment at Workplace Act, 2010, and appointed an additional judge replacing her as the competent authority.”
Moreover, CJ Dogar has “initiated an unfortunate practice of using judicial powers that undermine the independence of the judiciary. In several cases, judicial powers have been exercised not only to transfer pending cases from one judge to another, but also an unprecedented practice of issuing writ of certiorari (i.e. suspending proceedings before the judges of the same court) has also started.”
This is happening when it is settled law that judges cannot issue writs in pending matters to the same court, the judges say.
But, “in Chief Justice Dogar’s time, we are witnessing this practice as a tool, to restrain the petitioner judges from proceeding to hear matters that are fixed for hearing before the court.”
For instance, recently, a division bench comprising CJ Dogar and Justice Azam Khan
restrained
Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work.
In this case, the exercise of judicial powers in “breach of principles of fair trial and due process” is a “potent example of self-cannibalisation by an institution!”
It is the “latest manifestation of the retribution that some of the petitioner judges have been threatened with, for exercise of judicial authority in a manner in select cases that powerful members of the executive found disagreeable.”",2025-09-19,Dawn.com,4786,0.000419

Police later arrested six students on charges of vandalism, though the students’ group, Baloch Students Action Committee (BSAC), alleged the number of detainees was much higher.
The group has been demonstrating for several days against the suspension of multiple students by the university administration.
According to BSAC, the dispute began on Sept 16 when the university administration with the help of police forcibly ended a commemorative event for renowned poet Mubarak Qazi and suspended several students following the clash, sparking the protests.
As BSAC members attempted to set up a protest camp inside the university, the administration again called in police, who used batons and tear-gas shells to disperse the protesters. Videos circulating on social media showed students running inside the campus while gunfire could be heard.
Students claimed that two of their colleagues were injured due to police firing.
However, DSP Hasil Khan denied any firing, stating that only baton charge and tear gas were used to disperse the violent crowd.
The police officer said six students were arrested following the clash on charges of vandalism.

Leaders of six opposition parties — Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Tehreek Tahaffuz-i-Aain-i-Pakistan, Awami National Party (ANP), Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, and National Party — strongly condemned the tragic incident in a meeting and announced a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike throughout the province.
They declared that during the strike highways, intercity roads, and routes leading to Quetta airport and railway station would be blocked. Other airports in the province would also be shut, with no air travel allowed.
Opposition leaders and their supporters also distributed pamphlets about the strike among traders, business centres, hotels, and the general public. They urged the business community and transporters to support the strike.
Trader organisations and transporters had already expressed their support for the strike call. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry, along with other business associations, also announced closure of businesses across the province in solidarity with the victims of the suicide bombing.
Though the government has not announced the closure of its educational institutions today, the Private Schools Association declared that all private schools, colleges, and universities would remain closed.

According to officials, the total lunar eclipse, also known as “
blood moon
”, will last from 10:31pm to 11:53pm on Sunday.
“It will be an exceptionally lengthy total lunar eclipse that’s expected to last for over 80 minutes, one of the longest in decades,” said ISST Director Prof Javed Iqbal.
The long lasting eclipse, he said, would be visible to billions of people across Asia, Africa, Australia and Europe. “A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the earth’s shadow, causing the moon to be darkened.”
He said it’s the second total lunar eclipse of 2025 and unlike solar eclipses, it’s safe to view without any eye protection.
At the KU’s observatory, visitors can watch the astronomical event with the help of telescopes.
“We have a 16-inch and an eight-inch telescope that our students also use. We will be there to facilitate visitors for the event. The first phase of the eclipse will start from 8:28pm onwards while the total eclipse will begin around 10:30pm.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1938785/audit-reveals-serious-regulation-violations-by-islamabad-housing-societies,Audit reveals serious regulation violations by Islamabad housing societies - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: A federal audit has pointed out serious violations of regulations by housing societies, noting that they are not sharing allotment letters with the Capital Development Authority (CDA) through the required digital platform.
At the same time, the civic agency itself has failed to implement a vetting mechanism for transfer letters of plots in housing schemes, raising questions about the protection of citizens’ rights and the prevention of over-invoicing, the report said.
The CDA, as the regulatory authority for housing schemes, is responsible for ensuring compliance with zoning laws and development regulations.
According to the audit report, the issue of housing societies not sharing allotment letters was highlighted through a digital monitoring platform.
Report highlights absence of digital monitoring; discrepancies include lack of plot transfer vetting and recurring irregularities
However, information collected by
Dawn
revealed that the civic agency had also failed to put in place a system to vet transfer letters of allotments issued by housing societies. This lack of oversight has left buyers vulnerable to fraud and over-invoicing, contrary to CDA’s own regulations.
“Audit observed that the allotment letters of the plots, flats and apartments issued by sponsors of housing schemes are not being shared with CDA through a digital platform such as the Management Information System (MIS)/ERP.
This was required for regulating the saleable area within approved layout plans and building plans of the projects,” the audit report noted.
The report stated that the absence of a digital platform and the failure of the Housing Societies Directorate, Planning Wing, CDA, to devise a monitoring mechanism had resulted in irregularities.
“Audit maintains that this irregularity occurred due to violation of zoning regulations and lack of oversight mechanism,” the report said.
The irregularity was pointed out in February 2024. According to the report, CDA’s management did not respond.
The matter was later discussed in a Departmental Accounts Committee (DAC) meeting held on December 11, 2024.
CDA management informed the meeting that the digitisation process had begun in 2019 and that letters had been issued to all sponsors of housing societies and schemes for the development of MIS/ERP.
The DAC directed CDA to share the progress of MIS/ERP implementation with the audit office within 90 days.
“Compliance of DAC directives was not made. Audit recommends compliance of DAC directive,” the report said, adding that the same irregularity had been highlighted in the 2022-23 audit report as well. “The recurrence of similar irregularity is a matter of serious concern,” it added.
In 2023, CDA introduced new regulations requiring all housing societies to have their transfer letters vetted by the authority.
CDA was to verify only those plots that were part of the approved layout plan. Despite this, the authority has failed to implement its own rules, raising serious questions about the efficiency of its management.
“If plots are vetted by CDA, people could be saved from fraud. In the past, many housing societies sold plots carved out on land reserved for amenities such as graveyards, playgrounds and parks,” a source told
Dawn
.
The source added that several cases of over-invoicing had also been reported, where societies sold more plots than the land actually available. “When CDA’s vetting becomes part of the transfer process, such fraud can be prevented,” the source explained.
Despite these regulations, CDA has consistently ignored implementation, even though the rules were approved by its board in 2023 and published in the official Gazette.
These rules were designed to protect citizens from fraud, over-invoicing, and the allotment of plots on non-existent land.
Like other parts of the country, many residents of Islamabad have also fallen victim to fraudulent housing schemes, paying for plots that were never handed over.
When contacted, CDA spokesperson Shahid Kiani said, “CDA has already taken up the matter with the sponsors and owners of private housing societies through multiple communications, categorically asking for provision of data through MIS/ERP under clause 40(7) and (8) of regulations for planning and development of private housing societies.”
He further emphasised, “It is again highlighted for public awareness that no allotment letter—whether original, provisional or through transfer—in case of housing societies should bear any credence unless vetted, signed and stamped by the concerned Director (Planning).”
The spokesperson also said that CDA had launched a campaign against housing societies violating regulations. “We are circulating their names, sealing their offices, and imposing penalties in light of the regulations,” he said.

He was speaking at an event organised by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry here on Thursday.
“The projects I’m going to talk to you about today have already taken off and you will see the results of our efforts soon,” he said.
The federal minister said that he was trying to build up the railways infrastructure within their limited resources. “We are still using coaches from the 1960s,” he said.
“Yes, we are also incorporating eight to 10 coaches from China in our trains after every two or three months. But there are so many other problems that we are facing also such as newer and faster trains but not strong enough tracks to run them on,” he said.
One way to run the railways more efficiently, according to the minister, is through outsourcing. Pakistan Railways has picked up speed while moving in that direction. “The prime minister asked me to look into outsourcing. So as I speak, 11 passenger trains have already been outsourced while another nine would also be outsourced in the next six days and the rest after that. In total there are 38 trains, which will be outsourced. Similarly, we will also be outsourcing freight trains,” the federal minister shared.
Railways minister shares PR’s plan to outsource 38 trains, eight hospitals and 14 schools
They also plan to outsource eight big Railways hospitals and 14 schools, the deals for four of which have also been finalised. But, he said, that despite these steps, their workers will not lose any benefits. In fact, railways workers and their families will receive free medical and medicines. There will be subsidised school fees in the outsourced schools for workers’ children. Further outsourcing plans also include the railways sleeper factory.
To bring passengers back to Pakistan Railways, they are looking to facilitate them by digitising their system, installing ATMs at stations along with point-of-sale terminals for easy transactions. Plus, new Commercially Important Person (CIP) lounges for passengers, new washrooms and escalators.
Efforts are also under way to improve punctuality. Hanif Abbasi said that they have signed an agreement with Asian Development Bank for a $2 million project for laying a new Karachi to Rohri track of 480km, a part of the
ML-1 track
. “It was the worst track where train speed had to be reduced. Finishing that track will make a big difference of four hours,” he said.
The issue of derailment has also been addressed by getting a new head of mechanics to look into that issue.
Besides Rs15 billion worth of encroached railways land has also been recovered. “And there is 50 billion worth of more property which we intend to take back,” he said.
While reminding of the importance of Karachi, the federal minister said that without this city, Pakistan loses its economy. He also said that he had been approached by landlocked countries such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan asking for not road access but train access for trade. “For this we have signed an agreement in Kabul for railroad access from Kohat to Karlachi [a crossing between Afghanistan and Pakistan on the Durand Line] to Mazar-i-Sharif from where there already is a 75km track to Uzbekistan’s border. Meanwhile, Kazakhstan wants train access through Chaman to reach the Karachi and Gwadar ports. Besides, for the transport of our own coal and minerals from Thar Coal we have given the FWO a 105km target,” he shared.
Meanwhile, the federal minister made no mention of the Karachi Circular Railway. Even when a journalist brought it up he was sternly told to do his homework before asking questions about things, which did not concern him.
Following the KCCI event, the federal minister met Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani where under a formal agreement with the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board extensive measures will be taken to ensure cleanliness inside Karachi’s Cantonment and City railway stations, trains and their surrounding areas by using modern technology.
Later, Hanif Abbasi also met the chairman of Karachi Port Trust, Rear Admiral Ateeq ur Rehman Abid, at the KPT Head Office to discuss issues related to the Dedicated Freight Corridor as well as pertaining to the East and West wharves renewal/operations. The focus of the meeting remained on the importance of railways for cargo handling, which brought to fore the requirements of improving rail tracks nationwide as well as those linked to the Karachi Port.
The chairman informed the federal minister about their planned connectivity projects where rail links are extremely pivotal as they offer a solution to address traffic congestion due to port activities.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941313/fbr-de-seals-capitals-largest-book-shop,FBR de-seals capital’s largest book shop - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has de-sealed Saeed Book Bank, a renowned bookstore in the posh Sector F-7 market of the federal capital.
The bookstore was sealed on Tuesday by the FBR on charges of failing to integrate its Point of Sales (POS) system with the FBR’s requirements. The action was carried out by the Regional Tax Office.
An official from the FBR stated that a notice was issued in April this year requesting the installation of the POS system, and when this was not fulfilled, the store was sealed. It was de-sealed after receiving “assurance by the bookshop.”
Located in Jinnah Super Market, this bookstore is one of the prominent outlets. It is frequented by diplomats, tourists, and avid readers as it offers a broad selection of books.
The owner of the bookstore, Ahmed Saeed, who is currently in London attending a book fair, spoke to
Dawn
, protesting the FBR’s sealing action and calling it unjustified, saying that it has severely damaged the 80-year-old reputation of his store.
“Though our store has been de-sealed. That’s fine. But, if such situations [actions of FBR] persist and the government does not support us, then we will have no option but to close this 80-year-old legacy. I might even rent out the property to some coffee businessmen or food chains to earn more than I do from this book business,” he told
Dawn.
Mr Saeed mentioned that the decline in bookshop business is ongoing, with well-known outlets such as London Book Company, Durrani & Company Book Store, and Mr Book (F-6) also struggling.
He explained that his shop was sealed over a minor issue related to POS machines, not tax evasion. Mr Saeed insisted this was a matter of registration, which does not apply to bookshops.
“Some three months ago, we received a notice, and we submitted a reply to the FBR. As per the Sales Tax Act, Schedule 6, books and educational stationery are exempt, and we are not liable to install POS. After our reply, we assumed that the matter was resolved,” he said.
“But suddenly, on Tuesday, the FBR team conducted a sealing operation and humiliated customers and staff as well.”
“After our reply, if FBR had any issue, they should have contacted us and given us a chance for a hearing and a meeting to resolve the matter amicably instead of sealing,” he added.
The Saeed Book Bank began its operations in Peshawar in 1974 before opening the branch in Islamabad about 25 years ago.
Mehboob Khan, a book enthusiast from Sector G-6, expressed his disappointment at the store’s closure. “I am very happy after the reopening of this store. The government should take steps to promote bookstores and reading habits,” he said.
The Manager of Saeed Book Bank, Akhtar Gul, told
Dawn
that the issue has been resolved. “Last night, FBR, on the intervention of the federal government, de-sealed our store and subsequently, we reopened it today,” he said, adding that customers expressed happiness upon seeing their beloved bookstore reopen.

building collapse
that claimed 27 lives in July, the Sindh government has initiated “reforms” to overhaul the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) with a new draft of law that proposes establishment of a separate force for the regulatory body to monitor
illegal construction
and making all related offences cognizable, non-bailable, and non-compoundable, with penalties for those found guilty.
The draft of the amended SBCA law, a copy of which is available with
Dawn
, was already shared with stakeholders by the Sindh government.
The proposed force would be tasked with implementing building  regulations and cracking down on illegal construction activities.
The draft law reads: “For  the purpose of effectively preventing and controlling the unauthorised  construction of buildings, and demolition of the unauthorised and  dangerous and dilapidated buildings in the province, the field  establishment under sub-section (2) shall form and constitute the SBCA  Force, which shall perform functions as may be assigned to it by the  director general with the approval of the governing body.”
11-member governing body comprising experts and govt officials planned
Sources said that the proposed reforms also included the establishment of a governing body comprising senior officials and experts to oversee operations and ensure transparency and accountability.
“Among key features of the proposed law include constitution of the governing body for the SBCA,” said a source privy to the details of the draft.
“The 11-member body would be led by local government minister while additional chief secretary of local government, commissioner of the concerned division, chairman of Pakistan Engineering Council, chairman of Pakistan Council of Architects and Town Planners, vice chancellor of NED university, vice chancellor of MUET Jamshoro, director general of KDA, CEO of KWSC, senior director of Sindh Master Plan Authority and DG of SBCA have been proposed as members of the body,” the source added.
The draft law, which is proposed to be called “Sindh Building Control Authority Act 2025”, proposes that “all offences under this act shall be cognizable by police, non-bailable, and non-compoundable”.
However, it says: “It shall extend to the entire province of Sindh but shall not apply to Cantonment areas.”
It defines a range of construction-related violations and recommends penalties of up to five years’ imprisonment and up to five million rupees fine for builders, developers, or property owners found involved in illegal construction activities.
Muhammad Hassan Bakhshi, chairman of the Association of Builders and Developers, who also received a copy of the draft law, welcomed the government’s move.
He said that effective implementation of the law in its true spirit could help put an end to the menace of illegal construction.
Advocate Saifuddin of Jamaat-i-Islami, who is the leader of the opposition in the City Council, also got a copy of the proposed amendments.However, he said he would comment only after thoroughly reviewing the document.
“However, we believe that the SBCA governing body must include public representation and opposition members should also be part of this body,” he added.

Multan Deputy Commissioner (DC) Wasim Hamid Sindhu and City Police Officer (CPO) Sadiq Ali Dogar later reached the site for an inspection and were briefed by officials present there.
“The causes of the boat accident are being carefully examined. Initially, five deaths, including children on board the boat, have been confirmed,” DC Sindhu was quoted as saying in a statement. A statement from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) also put the toll at five.
He ordered the rescue authorities to immediately intensify the search operation. “Rescue operations are being carried out to search for more people on board the boat,” Sindhu said.
Meanwhile, CPO Dogar said police teams were providing full support to Rescue 1122 and the initial reasons for the boat accident included the darkness and flooded routes.
The initial report from Rescue 1122 explained that the boat had hit a tree and capsized due to the strong water flow, along with the women and children on board not able to maintain their balance, while evacuating people from floodwaters in Jalalpur Pirwala.
It added that most of the women and children were aboard the boat and the depth of the water was 15 to 20 feet.
The report said personnel launched search and rescue operations and four bodies were retrieved, while the rest of the people were recovered. “Line searching and boat searching are being conducted at different places to search for one child,” it said.
A statement from the department said Rescue 1122 Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer expressed grief over the deaths and ordered the divisional emergency officer to immediately share the incident report.
Multan Commissioner Aamir Karim Khan also expressed grief over the deaths and extended his condolences to the families of the deceased.
Punjab PDMA Director General Irfan Kathia directed that the best medical assistance be provided to the injured.
“Evacuation of victims should be made safe in a flood situation. There should be no overloading in private boats or rescue boats,” he ordered.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz took notice of the incident and extended her condolences to the families of the victims.
Rescue 1122 said that it had rescued more than 9,000 people in flood operations from Multan alone, while over 350,000 people and above 300,000 animals had been evacuated in advance.",2025-09-06,Imran Gabol,629,0.000107
https://www.dawn.com/news/1939684/talk-of-hybrid-system-is-admission-of-dictatorship-justice-minallah,Talk of ‘hybrid system’ is admission of dictatorship: Justice Minallah - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Supreme Court Justice Athar Minallah on Thursday said that the talk of a “
hybrid system
” prevalent in the country actually amounted to an admission to the presence of a dictatorship.
What had previously only been a term coined by analysts to describe the unique system of governance currently in vogue, is now apparently being worn as a badge of honour. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had in July spoken in glowing terms about the ‘hybrid regime’ that currently runs the country. The term is used to describe the informal power-sharing arrangement, whereby the country’s military holds a great deal of influence on the incumbent civilian setup and has a big say in the way the affairs of the state are managed.
In remarks on the issue while addressing the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) today, Justice Minallah said: “It is something to accept that people today say there is a hybrid system, that [actually] means there is dictatorship and there is no constitutional governance.”
He blamed what he said was the “lack of constitutional governance” in the country that was responsible for elite capture over the rule of law or the Constitution.
“I had to write in many high court orders that there is no rule of law or Constitution in the country; there is elite capture,” he explained.
He said that the history of the country’s judiciary was “not something to be proud of for me”.
The judge said that his generation had passed its time, caused whatever destruction it could to the country, and should never be afraid to admit it, adding that they could not blame anyone else and that this had kept happening throughout the country’s history.
Justice Minallah said that, as per the oath, judges had to impartially decide cases in accordance with the law and defend the Constitution without fear or favour, adding that the judiciary at all levels was bound to the oath and answerable to God and the people.
He explained that if there was a lack of constitutional governance in the country and he, as a judge, did nothing about it, he would not only be violating the Constitution but also his oath.
“Unfortunately, we are taught distorted history, and no one tells us the truth. Our generation did whatever it could do; the most we can do now is to hand over the baton to you and at least tell you the truth.
“The societies in which the truth is eliminated and truth ceases to be spoken are destroyed.”
Justice Minallah further said that no lesson had been learnt from history.
“The root of the country’s split in 1971 was laid down in the dissolution of the constituent assembly by the civil-military bureaucracy,” he said, pointing out that while there had always been free and independent judges in the country’s history, “the judiciary has never played the role that it ought to have.”
He said the Constitution was the expression of the people’s will and premised on the people’s right to rule through elected representatives, adding that it demanded that no institution or political officeholder would engage in political engineering and that any representatives would be elected through fair and transparent means.
“Unfortunately, that too has remained a dream for our history.”
He said the only way forward was to abide by the Constitution and govern the country accordingly, together with the upcoming young generation.
“This idealism of the youth will bring a change in the country. We know that fundamental rights are meaningless, there is no freedom of expression, there is a restriction on political thoughts and criticism,” he said, adding that the country would not have split if there had not been a clampdown on the freedom of expression.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1938865,Situationer: Torn between preserving life and livelihood - DAWN.COM,"At the
flood relief camp
established by Rangers near the Talwar post on the border with India, Javed Ali, a man in his 40s, disembarks from a rescue boat.
He is accompanied by his wife, a toddler daughter and around a dozen members his family, who have come to the camp in the hope of getting some relief goods.
“The flood hit our village, Nagar, about 10 days ago, but the water did not reach our homes until three days back. On Thursday, it surrounded my house and the rest of my neighbourhood. We could not leave on our own because there was water all around the village.”
“I kept calling the helpline, as well as a welfare organisation, but despite promises that they would send the boat, help arrived today after three days. Now, tell me where to go from here?” he asks, pointedly.
Javed’s daughter has a fever and she has developed a skin allergy due to exposure to rain and floodwater. His niece and wife also have similar symptoms, so they make a beeline for the medical camp, where a doctor examines them and gives them some medicine.
When asked where they they will go from here, Javed says they have to make it to their relatives in Bhai Pheru. “But I don’t know how to reach Kasur from here,” he says, looking around for help.
A rescuer tells him that their duty is to evacuate them from flooded areas; they cannot promise further conveyance.
Javed’s is one of the many families who were rescued and brought to the relief camp near the Talwar post. The border with India can be seen across the huge body of water that spreads as far as the eye can see.
This site has become an assembly point for flood-hit people from around 16 villages, the last Pakistani settlements before the border. Now, they are all inundated with water from the River Sutlej.
The meandering Sutlej flowing alongside lush green rice fields: this is the sight that greets us on our way to the Ganda Singh border.
Initially, as we head down the main road, there is no sign of flooding. But as the village of Mahalam Kalan nears, around 15km from Ferozepur Road, the presence of Rangers bunkers and military personnel indicates that something is up.
At Rajiwala Araiyaan, the floodwater comes into view, along with a hullabaloo of activity, with hordes of flood-affected people and their cattle gathering in groups as relief activities are in full swing.
It has been two weeks since waters from the overflowing Sutlej first hit this area, but rescue boats are still busy ferrying those stranded in nearly villages.
A medical camp has been established near the Talwar Post, so that flood victims can receive first aid before they head out, most seeking shelter with relatives in nearby towns, or in relief camps.
The embankment at Rajiwala Road, on the edge of the floodwaters, is quite muddy due to fresh rain. Here, we see about 50 sheep, and Salman – a young man in his 20s – tending to them. He tells us he brought his animals to safety in a rickety boat around 11 days ago.
“There is nothing left in our houses. All we have were these animals. We are keeping the sheep here, but we have sent cows and other large animals ahead for fodder. There is nothing here. We don’t even have fodder for the sheep. We are arranging everything on our own, including food.”
He says there were 150 houses in his village, all of which were empty by the time they left. The authorities are preventing anyone from going back, so most people are understandably quite anxious about the state of their homes.
The main concern here is not just with people or property; it is the animals. Most of the flood-hit villagers are farmers who depend on their cattle for their livelihood. They cannot simply leave them behind, and relocating them to far-flung places is not feasible.
Mushtaq and Shahid, from the Bhikhiwind village, have also tethered their cows and buffaloes near the relief camp. They point to their village from where they sit; there is nothing there but deep, unnavigable waters.
They say that in the past, the water would reach their village, but it never breached their homes. This year, they said, there was more water than they had ever seen in their lives.
There were 25 families living in Bhikhiwind, all of whom have now been evacuated.
Around a fortnight ago, when they first evacuated, one man from each family stayed behind to protect their animals and property. However, law enforcement forced these stragglers out too, and now the people complain they have no support from the government, either in arranging food for themselves or fodder for their animals.
When we head over to the relief camp set up in the Rajiwala school, the guards don’t let us enter.
Amir Ali, a policeman deployed at the camp, says that residents of around 16 flooded villages had been brought to the camp. If people don’t leave their flooded villages and homes, the police brings them over forcibly, he says.
But the women from Bhikhiwind tell us that the day the army chief visited the area, they were enrolled at the camp. However, they did not receive any food, despite waiting the entire day.
The disappointed families say that they don’t expect anything from the government now. “Only Al-Khair and Al-Khidmat Foundation gave us some food,” says Mushtaq.
However, officials deputed at the relief camp deny these allegations. “Many people from the villages which are not affected by flood also approach the camp to demand food and fodder. We need to check their CNICs and seek the evidence of animals and family members,” said an official.
Muhammad Farooq has been voluntarily operating a raft (locally known as a Baira) since the flood hit. When we meet him, he is bringing ashore a motorcycle-rickshaw, a couple of heads of cattle, as well as people from the villages of Changa Singh and Dhupsari.
He says he gets diesel from the deputy commissioner’s office to run his Baira, which he uses to transport people, their animals and other heavy loads to the camp.
Asif, a resident of Changa Singh, is disembarking from Farooq’s raft as we arrive. He has just returned from a visit to his inundated village, which he left about eight days ago.
When they left, some elders were left behind to look after the houses, and every couple of days, someone returns to check on them. On this trip, Asif spent the night trying to save his family’s wheat stocks, placing them on the rooftop and covering them up to protect them from the elements.
But as the heavens open up, he looks crestfallen, fearing the rain might spoil their wheat too.

During the proceedings, CCPO Bilal Siddique Kamyana, DIG Investigation Zeeshan Raza and other police officers appeared before the court.
The CCPO submitted a report on efforts made for the recovery of the woman. He stated that the police had undertaken extensive efforts in the case.
Chief Justice Aalia Neelum observed that there was no such woman who cannot be traced by the police. She noted that the alleged abducted woman was a housewife.
The CCPO said that the woman did not even possess a mobile phone that could be tracked. He pointed out that two rounds of investigations had already been completed and a third inquiry was currently underway.
Being dissatisfied with the police efforts, Chief Justice Neelum remarked that it appeared reports were being drafted sitting in the office instead of fieldwork.
The CJ directed the IGP to personally appear in the court on Thursday (today).
A counsel for the petitioner, Hameedan Bibi, pointed out that an FIR had been registered against the victim’s husband and mother-in-law six years ago, but she had still not been recovered.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942975/india-says-analysing-implications-of-pak-saudi-mutual-defence-pact-for-national-security,India says analysing ‘implications’ of Pak-Saudi mutual defence pact for national security - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Thursday that it was analysing the “implications” of the recent
mutual defence deal
between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia for its own national security.
Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday.
A military confrontation between India and Pakistan recently occurred in May as the former, without evidence,
linked
the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which
strongly denied
the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi
launched
a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least
40 civilians
. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which
stretched
over the week, before a US-brokered
ceasefire
had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.
In a statement issued on today’s development, the Indian MEA said: “We will study the implications of this development for our national security as well as for regional and global stability. The government remains committed to protecting India’s national interests and ensuring comprehensive national security in all domains.”
It added that the Indian government was already aware that the development, which it said “formalises a long-standing arrangement between the two countries”, was under consideration.
Pakistan and India have fought three major wars since the two countries were carved out of British colonial India in 1947.
After they both acquired nuclear weapons in the late 1990s, their conflicts have been more limited in scale because of the danger of nuclear assets coming into play.
According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”.
“[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details.
Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an
Arab summit
that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of
Israel’s attack
on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries.
The agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades. Cooperation between the two states dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979 Grand Mosque
seizure
, when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram.
In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms.
In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In February, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges.
The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella, though finer details of the agreement were not made public.
For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider.
For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting the Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time.
Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded. Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkiye and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses.
Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represented Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.",2025-09-18,Dawn.com,1179,0.000148

As many as 4.8m girls were married before the age of 15, underscoring the urgency of coordinated national action.
Despite constitutional protections, disparities in legal marriage age persist across provinces, with only Sindh and the Islamabad Capital Territory enforcing 18 as the minimum age for girls, a gap that continues to expose millions to early pregnancies, domestic violence, and educational exclusion.
It was informed during the National Civil Society Dialogue and Dissemination Event on the Ending Child, Early, and Forced Marriage (CEFM) project. Civil society leaders, parliamentarians, child protection experts, youth advocates, and government representatives attended the event organised by Strengthening Participatory Organisation (SPO) with support from the US Department of State and Save the Children.
Country Director of Save the Children, Khurram Gondal, said: “True change requires more than policies; it demands consistency, commitment, and the collective efforts of government, civil society, and local partners.”
Manager for the CEFM program at SPO, Jamil Asgher Bhatti, revealed that a recent analysis in Sindh and Balochistan found nearly 60 per cent of respondents were married before the age of 18.
Senator retired Javed Jabbar applauded the effort as “a critical step toward empowering girls and safeguarding their future”, highlighting Pakistan’s proud history of trailblazing women leaders such as Fatima Jinnah and Benazir Bhutto, figures who “would never have achieved such milestones had they been married off at a young age”. He further emphasised that “we must not wait for foreign funding to drive such efforts; the resolve to protect our children must come from within”.
Chief Executive of SPO Ms Arifa Mazhar urged stakeholders to move beyond a project-based approach toward a sustained, community-driven movement.
“This is not just a project, it is a collective mission,” she said, thanking partners, youth leaders, and Save the Children for their collaboration, and affirming that “this is not the end, but the beginning of a new chapter in the fight against child marriage”.

According to the administration, the next two days are critical and they are making all-out efforts to tackle any untoward situation.
The Sutlej was in exceptionally high flood despite the fact that the water receded to over 100,000 cusecs. Crops at 10 downstream villages were submerged with water as Jalaldinwala embankment was washed away.
The villages include Fatohiwala, Chohriwala, Wazirpur, Kujian, Nooriwala, Kharaipar, Aloanna, Chhabar, Bhadian and Usmanwala whereas the villages on upstream would face a flood wave if Talwar post embankment breaks, said a handout.
It is important to mention here that, in case, the Talwar post dyke breaches, the villages near the city could also be flooded.
The police deputed at Talwar post are not allowing any one to go ahead of the post in the wake of the rising risk of water surge to a dangerous level.
At the Talwar post near the border, the district administration has established its camps, which are in danger as cracks have started appearing in the embankment.
A couple of days back, the administration decided to leave the Talwar post and establish camps somewhere else, keeping in view the condition of embankment.
On Monday, according to official handout, the water discharge at Ganda Singh headworks was 240,000 cusecs. The Sutlej recently witnessed a water discharge of 385,000 but it reduced significantly in a day as water spread to the villages, washing away several embankments.
The river has been wreaking havoc with its mighty water waves for the last seven days in over 72 villages, the handout further said.
According to the handout, 70,000 people had been evacuated besides 169,000 animals were shifted to safer place in the district so far.
According to Rescue officials, it rescued a boat carrying two families and volunteers of a charity organization in the Kothi Fateh Muhammad area of Kanganpur. The rescuers rushed to the spot as the boat riders called for help at 1122. The incident took place due to engine failure.
Separately, two people drowned in the floodwater. Abdul Salam, 30, drowned at village Rajiwal near Mandi Usmanwala while fetching fodder for his cattle. Muhammad Arshad, 18, drowned while bathing in the Ravi at village Sindhu Kalan of Pattoki.
So far, four persons had drowned in the floodwater in Kasur.
On the other hand, water discharge in the Ravi at Head Balloki has reduced to 162,290 from the peak discharge of 225,000 cusecs.

pact with Saudi Arabia
.
Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday.
The agreement came amid diplomatic upheaval in the Middle East and just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May.
“It’s premature to say anything, but some other countries want to enter into an agreement of this nature,” Dar told reporters in London, replying to a question about whether other states will join the pact or ink similar deals. “This was not signed overnight; it has taken several months.”
Calling the agreement a “historic pact”, FM Dar said Pakistan has always maintained an informal defence arrangement with Saudi Arabia, which is the same as the agreement signed on Wednesday.
“I believe that both sides are very happy. Let’s be frank: Saudi Arabia has stood with us during difficult times, such as the sanctions. Their support was very relevant and important,” he added. “Similarly, during the current crisis since 2022-2023, when we needed IMF (International Monetary Fund) support, Saudi Arabia stood with us.”
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif told
Reuters
that nuclear weapons were “not on the radar” of the pact. He said the agreement could be extended to cover other Gulf nations.
“We have no intention of using this pact for any aggression,” said Asif. “But if the parties are threatened, then obviously this arrangement will become operative.”
In contrast, asked a day ago about whether Pakistan’s nuclear assets were also up for use under the agreement, Asif said: “What we have, our capabilities, will absolutely be available under this pact.
PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also welcomed the development.
He said the way the deal was signed in the context of the recent conflict with India was a “very positive” development for both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and congratulated the prime minister for pulling it off.
Separately, India said it hoped Saudi Arabia would keep in mind mutual interests and sensitivities between it and archival Pakistan.
“India and Saudi Arabia have a wide-ranging strategic partnership which has deepened considerably in the last few years,” Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters during a weekly news briefing.
“We expect that this strategic partnership will keep in mind mutual interests and sensitivities,” he said.
Saudi Arabia is one of the top exporters of petroleum to India and the two countries agreed this year to boost cooperation in supplies of crude and liquefied petroleum gas.
The two nations were also exploring joint projects in refineries and petrochemicals, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said this year.
A day ago, India’s foreign ministry said it was aware that the pact had been under consideration and that it would study the implications for New Delhi.

A press release from the Chief Minister’s Secretariat on Friday said that presiding over the 19th cabinet meeting, CM Sarfraz Bugti described the decisions as a guarantee for the province’s public interest and sustainable development, reaffirming his administration’s commitment to practical reforms that uplifted minorities, women and the transgender community.
It added that the cabinet approved the formulation of a dedicated fund to enhance facilities and ensure equal opportunities for minority communities, approved a province-wide ban on the publication of hate speech to foster societal harmony and curb divisive rhetoric and endorsed Balochistan’s inaugural policy for transgender individuals, aimed at securing their rights and promoting social and economic inclusion.
Addressing the meeting, CM Bugti said the cabinet’s decisions were a “guarantee of public interest and sustainable development” in the province.
“Our government believes in moving forward with all segments of society and is taking practical steps to protect the rights of marginalised groups, including minorities, women, and transgender people,” he said.
He added that major projects in health, education, and infrastructure were being initiated to provide better facilities and deliver improved services to the public and lasting progress.
CM Bugti said that the cabinet’s decisions served as a “practical demonstration of transparency and good governance, reflecting a positive and sustainable journey” towards the province’s progress and prosperity.
The Balochistan Assembly in July had
adopted an important bill
about providing protection to women at their workplace from harassment, with members terming it a significant step towards ensuring a safe and inclusive environment for working women in the province.

20-point peace plan
for Gaza announced by US President Trump yesterday, saying that it could be a formula for Israel’s expansion, but it cannot be one for the recognition of a Palestinian state or the liberation of Jerusalem.
According to a statement issued by the JUI-F media cell, addressing a press conference in Lahore today, Fazl said: “Today is the day of Trump and (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu.”
A day earlier, Trump, alongside Netanyahu, unveiled a 20-point plan for Gaza, seeking to broker a ceasefire, a hostage exchange, demilitarisation, and a transitional governance structure.
The two leaders have warned that Israel would “finish the job” against Hamas if the Palestinian group rejects the deal.
Key Muslim nations have
thrown their weight
behind the plan while Washington’s European allies have urged Hamas to accept it.
Trump said that “Hamas and other terror organisations will play no role in the governance of Gaza, at all”.
The JUI-F chief noted that Hamas is an elected party of the people. “So ignoring Hamas means that you are trying to force a decision on them.”
He said that at present, the US has made Hamas indifferent in all its talks and narratives, “while the real side is Hamas”.
“The Palestinian issue can never be resolved without recognising Hamas as the real party,” he added.
“It’s surprising that the US is brazenly backing this criminal (Netanyahu),” he said.
Fazl declared that no decision can be forced on the Palestinian people until they decide for themselves.
“Israel does not recognise the existence of Palestine and Palestine does not recognise the existence of Israel.”
He added that in such a situation, the two-state solution may be anyone’s suggestion or wish, but no one has the right to force their wish on Palestine.
During his press conference, Trump had said: “The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were with us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a statement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump said, referring to a statement issued on Monday by PM Shehbaz Sharif. “They back this 100 per cent,” he said.
Earlier, in a post on X, PM Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the US president’s “20-point” plan to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end.
The JUI-F chief took a dig at PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“They (PM and COAS) should look at their previous and recent statements themselves to see how much they contradict.”
PTI expresses reservations over plan
The PTI has also expressed its “deep concern” over Trump’s peace plan for Gaza as it “seeks to determine the future of Palestine without ensuring the free will and consent of the Palestinian people”.
A statement shared by PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram on X read: “The recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and the acceptance of the occupied Syrian Golan Heights as Israeli territory are in clear violation of international law and UN resolutions, and they undermine global efforts for a just and lasting peace.”
It added that former prime minister Imran Khan has “consistently reaffirmed Pakistan’s principled position that peace in the Middle East can only be achieved through a fair two-state solution, one that fully reflects the aspirations of the Palestinian people themselves”.",2025-09-30,Dawn.com,851,0.000124

Speaking at a joint press conference along with other stakeholders on Monday, bus owners said the absence of sustainable sources of employment had already left people vulnerable, and now the unnecessary restrictions on local buses have worsened their plight.
They said that in compliance with court directives, 52-seater buses were withdrawn from service and replaced with 26-seater buses. Despite this, the Regional Transport Authority (RTA), traffic police, and law enforcement agencies continue to impose bans and harass bus operators without justification.
They criticised the authorities for obstructing affordable transport facilities for citizens and students. They said bus operators provide travel services for as little as Rs50, ensuring affordable commuting across long distances, yet face unjust treatment.
The association leaders demanded that Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, Parliamentary Secretary for Transport Liaquat Lehri, and other officials take notice of the issue, withdraw the unlawful restrictions, and ensure the implementation of court orders. They warned that if their grievances were not addressed, they would continue to raise their voice at every platform.

• Jalalpur Pirwala, Alipur and Rahim Yar Khan at risk amid rising river levels
• Over 4.2m affected, 2.19m relocated as floods hit 4,400 Punjab villages
• Guddu Barrage fluctuates between medium and high flood
• Five dead, hundreds rescued in Karachi after Lyari and Malir rivers swell
LAHORE/GUDDU: With South Punjab still in the throes of a devastating
flood crisis
, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has confirmed a high-lev­el flood situation, particularly in the Sutlej River, after India relea­sed more water on Wednesday.
All barrages in south Punjab on the Sutlej, Chenab and Ravi rivers are flowing at extremely dangerous levels, submerging vast swathes of low-lying areas and posing a severe threat to urban centres, such as Jalalpur, Alipur and Rahim Yar Khan tehsils.
Flood conditions in Jalalpur Pirwala, one of the most badly affected areas, intensified again after the Sutlej started rising and increased pressure on a major embankment.
On Wednesday, a rescue boat carrying 19 people
overturned
in the area, leading to the death of a child. All others were safely rescued, officials said.
Seven villages in Liaquatpur have been submerged due to the floods. In Alipur, a child died and five people went missing after a boat capsized.
The situation has worsened further due to the breach of the Azm­a­tpur embankment in the Alipur tehsil of Muzaffargarh district.
The ancient city of Seetpur is now at severe risk from floodwaters. Dozens of settlements, inclu­ding Khairpur Sadat, Khan Garh Doma, Azmatpur, Kundarala and Sultanpur, have been inundated.
Water flow
According to Flood Forecasting Data released at 11pm on Wednesday, the water flow at Ganda Singh Wala headworks on the Sutlej River was 182,188 cusecs (steady trend) and was classified as “very high flood”.
Downstream, the flow was steady at 121,698 cusecs (high flood) at Sulemanki headworks and 121,010 (high flood) at Islam headworks.
On the Ravi River, the water flow was normal at both Jassar and Shahdara headworks and was in low flood at Balloki. However, at Sidhnai headworks, the flow was categorised as “very high” at 94,556 cusecs (falling trend).
On the Chenab River, the flow at Panjnad was “very high” at 598,731 cusecs (rising) and “medium” at Trimmu at 231,154 cusecs (steady). The flow at other headworks on the river — Marala, Khanki, Qadirabad and Chiniot — was normal.
Meanwhile, Guddu Barrage recorded a brief spell of high flood on Wednesday morning before returning to medium flood levels by the afternoon, leaving officials puzzled as the anticipated peak has yet to arrive fully.
The barrage reached high flood stage at 6am with an upstream inflow of 502,844 cusecs and downstream discharge of 492,443 cusecs. “This indicated a high flood when the barrage passed a flow of 500,000 cusecs,” an official said.
Guddu Barrage Chief Engineer Sardar Shah said that following the morning surge, about 10,000 cusecs were diverted into the Begar Sindh Feeder canal on the right bank, which irrigates rice-growing districts in the command area.
Soon after, flows at Guddu fell to 493,281 cusecs upstream and 471,549 cusecs downstream by 1pm. By 11pm on Wednesday, the inflow was 495,509 cusecs, and the outflow was 472,094.
A gauge at Chachran also showed a decline, dropping from 10.5 feet to 10.3 feet by afternoon, indicating the Indus rise had been short-lived.
Mr Shah noted that with a 48-hour time lag between Panjnad and Guddu, the peak recorded at Panjnad on the evening of Sept 7 should have reached Guddu by Tuesday night. Instead, the rise was observed on Sept 10. He said if another peak is building upstream, it could arrive late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning.
Meanwhile, authorities at Sukkur Barrage said they were monitoring the situation closely. Upstream discharge at Sukkur was recorded at 405,665 cusecs and downstream at 382,355 cusecs, with officials watching for the expected peak.
Evacuations accelerated
Meanwhile, Punjab’s Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said that over 4,400 villages have been affected due to severe flooding in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers.
He said that 2,190 villages were affected due to flooding in the Chenab River, 651 villages in the Sutlej River and 1,495 villages in the Ravi River.
More than 4.2 million people have been affected due to the flood situation in the rivers, while 2.19m  people trapped in the floods have been relocated to safe locations.
He said that 404 relief camps and 488 medical camps were established in districts severely affected by floods.
Besides, 421 veterinary camps have been established to provide treatment facilities for livestock. In the affected districts, 1.581m animals have been relocated to safe locations during rescue and relief activities.
Mr Javaid said that Mangla Dam is 90 per cent full, while Tarbela Dam is 100pc full, India’s Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej River is 90pc full, Pong Dam is 99pc full and Thein Dam is 97pc full. He said that 76 citizens lost their lives in various incidents.
PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia said that the intensity of monsoon rains has decreased and no further increase in river flows was expected.
However, a Met office forecast indicated that isolated showers were expected in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir and the Pothohar region.
Five dead in Karachi
In Karachi, five people were killed and hundreds rescued as heavy downpours and hill torrents from the Kirthar range
swelled
the Lyari and Malir rivers to record levels, inundating low-lying neighbourhoods and damaging infrastructure.
Floodwaters submerged homes in Gadap, Scheme 33 and along the M-9 motorway, with major relief operations carried out by Edhi Foundation, Rescue 1122, security forces and civic agencies.
A 20-metre section of the Hub Canal and a gas pipeline were damaged, while part of the under-construction Malir Expressway collapsed. Authorities suspended heavy traffic on the M-9 amid fears of further inflows from Balochistan.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said more than 400 people were rescued in the city, while 172 people stranded on the motorway were evacuated.
Separately, four bodies were recovered from a flash flood incident in Gadap Town and a teenage boy died of electrocution in North Nazimabad.
Schools were closed on Wednesday but are set to reopen today (Thursday) as the weather system has moved away from the area.

Justice Dogar had
warned
Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had
issued
condemnatory statements and called for the judge’s dismissal from the post of the IHC top judge.
On Sept 15, Mazari
approached
an inquiry committee of the IHC and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), filing a complaint under Section 4 (procedure for holding inquiry) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010.
As Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz took cognisance of Mazari’s complaint, the IHC  administration
stripped
the judge of her powers to entertain harassment complaints. Instead, IHC’s Justice  Inaam Ameen Minhas was appointed as the competent authority to oversee the case. This prompted Mazari to
approach
the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against Justice Dogar’s shunting of a female judge for taking up a harassment complaint against him.
In today’s letter, addressed to Justice Minhas — a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
— Mazari said that the competent authority under the act was “required to communicate the charges to the accused within three days of receipt of the complaint, and the accused was required to submit a written defense within seven days from when the charge was communicated to him”.
“I am unaware of the status of my complaint, as I have not been informed by the competent authority in this regard,” she wrote.
Mazari called for a “clear urgency” to address the matter, saying, “I request redressal of my grievances at the earliest.”
She also brought up the matter of Justice Imtiaz’s removal as the competent authority and the appointment of Justice Minhas as a replacement, saying the move was “unlawful” as the “accused cannot alter the competent authority or impede my complaint by abusing his position of authority”.
She also highlighted “continuing acts of reprisal” by CJ Dogar following the complaint. “As you must be aware, such reprisals are strictly prohibited under the 2010 Act, and as competent authority, you are required to ensure that I am not subjected to such reprisals,” she said.
According to the letter, on Sept 16, Mazari’s client Mahrang Baloch’s case was fixed for a hearing before him, and Mazari’s proxy counsel requested a transfer of the case to any other bench due to the pending complaint.
“The accused refused to transfer the case, requiring me to appear before him despite the fact that under the law, no woman subjected to such treatment would be required to be in the presence of her alleged harasser,” she wrote.
“The aforementioned facts and circumstances clearly depict the brazen abuse of authority by the accused to shield himself from inquiry in my complaint,” she noted.
Mazari further said that her application seeking preservation of CCTV footage from the day of the incident remained “unanswered”, requesting “immediate intervention in securing this crucial evidence”.
Mazari had submitted an
application
to the IHC’s registrar for the preservation of CCTV footage of the “unfortunate incident” that took place with her.
In the application, she said: “I write to you today to seek [the] preservation of CCTV footage of the Honourable Chief Justice’s courtroom no.1 from September 11, 2025 between 9am and 11am, as an unfortunate incident took place with the undersigned counsel, as a result of which it is imperative that the exchange recorded on the CCTV footage is preserved.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940535/deadly-floods-risk-triggering-mass-migration-across-country,Deadly floods risk triggering mass migration across country - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Weeks of torrential monsoon rains have unleashed catastrophic
floods
across the country, killing more than 920 people,
displacing
nearly two million,
submerging
vast stretches of farmland, and sweeping away homes, schools and livestock.
The disaster could now trigger one of the country’s largest internal migrations since the devastating 2010 floods, aid agencies and local experts warn.
“Migration has already started in several areas as unprecedented rains and floods have left nothing behind for millions of people,” Shaukat Ali Chadhar, president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Agriculture, told
Anadolu
.
Chadhar said the ongoing deluges have already affected around 10m people dependent on agriculture across the country, mainly in Punjab.
“A multi-pronged combination of rains and floods has affected the farmers in many ways, destroying stored and standing crops, agricultural lands and livestock,” he explained, saying it could take up to 18 months for the land to become cultivable again.
“This gloomy scenario has left no choice for them but to migrate to the big cities to make a living,” Chadhar said, warning that as many as one million migrants could make the move.
Climate disaster compounded by human factors
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warned last Friday that Pakistan was facing one of its worst monsoon seasons in recent memory.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), at least 922 people have been killed and 1,047 injured since late June, while more than 10,000 homes have been partially or completely destroyed, mainly in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In late August, India — also battered by
heavy rains
— opened the gates of major dams on rivers shared under the Indus Waters Treaty,
cautioning
Pakistan that the releases could swell downstream floods. The added discharges pushed Punjab’s water levels even higher.
For the first time in the country’s 78-year history, three eastern rivers — the Sutlej, Jhelum and Chenab — are simultaneously at “exceptionally” high flood levels, according to local authorities.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, sudden glacial lake outburst
floods
added another layer of devastation, tearing through remote valleys and destroying homes, water systems and power lines. These floods occur when rains or rising temperatures cause mountain lakes to burst, releasing torrents of water and debris with little warning.
The UN says climate change is accelerating glacial melt across the Himalaya and Hindu Kush ranges, creating more unstable lakes and heightening the risk of such disasters.
“Unpredictable and intense weather patterns, shrinking agriculture, sea erosion, unemployment, and lingering dry spells have caused widespread migration within Pakistan in the past decade,” Hafiz Wasi Mohammad Khan, a member of the Punjab Agriculture Research Board, told
Anadolu
.
“We fear that this process would be further accelerated by the latest floods.”
He estimated that although temporary migration will be higher, around 25 per cent of the displaced people may never be able to return to their homes.
Earlier this year, the Climate Risk Index
ranked
Pakistan as the country most affected by climate change in 2022.
Experts also point to human-driven vulnerabilities such as unchecked land grabs and illegal constructions along natural drainage paths, which the government has vowed to address.
“Pakistan stands where it was in 2010 in terms of handling floods,” Khan said. “I suspect we will be discussing the same situation next year.”
Government planning ‘massive rehabilitation package’
In 2010, more than 2m people were displaced by
floods
that inundated one-fifth of the country. Of those, 70pc permanently settled in big cities because of the destruction of their homes and farmlands, according to the climate change ministry.
Khan warned that another wave of mass migration to already-overcrowded cities would not only add to their strained infrastructure but also fuel crime and deepen poverty.
“An enormous challenge is ahead in terms of rehabilitation and food security. The affected families have lost everything — their homes, lands, livestock and piled up stocks,” he said, adding that farmers urgently need cash inputs to procure seeds and other agricultural supplies.
He noted that many communities, especially downstream, have learned from recurring floods over the past two decades. In some cases, they even view them as opportunities, as floods can regenerate land and replenish underground water levels.
Chadhar called for the establishment of a “special agriculture fund” to help farmers, in addition to writing off their loans and utility bills, saying the government cannot handle the challenge of rehabilitation alone.
Meanwhile, Farid Abdulkadir Aiywar, IFRC head of delegation for Pakistan, urged the international community not to overlook the unfolding tragedy that is “quietly but relentlessly” devastating communities across the country.
“The crisis is far from over,” he told reporters on Friday. “Entire communities remain underwater, families have lost everything, and access to safe water and health care is becoming more urgent by the day.”
Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Irfan Ali Kathia, however, downplayed the chances of a large migration toward urban centres.
“This time, there will be no mass migration by [flood-affected people] as the government is set to announce a massive rehabilitation package for them, which will cover everything — from their crops and land losses to home destruction,” Kathia told

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939551,Situationer: Why breaching is ‘not  an option’ for Sindh - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"AS PUNJAB continues to use
breaches
to divert water from its overflowing rivers, Sindh may not be able to emulate this strategy due to its unique topography, with the minister concerned categorically ruling out this option.
Over the past week, authorities in Punjab have
destroyed
several embankments to save major cities from being inundated. Naturally, the Sindh government has been facing queries about whether a similar strategy will be deployed in the province.
The swollen eastern rivers of Ravi, Chenab, and Sutlej merge into the Indus River at Panjnad before
entering
Sindh, and the province faces a similar situation to the one it faced in September 2014.
The Indus River has already passed a medium and high flood through the Guddu and Sukkur barrages in July and August of this season.
Minister says Punjab’s strategy can’t be emulated downstream due to province’s peculiar topography
How much water will pass through Guddu now remains a guessing game, considering flow patterns at the barrage. The Trimmu barrage passed a peak of 550,965 cusecs on Sept 1, but the flows have yet to reach Guddu.
Officials remain unsure whether floodwaters from the Chenab would precede combined flows from the Ravi and Sutlej, which would accumulate at Panjnad before heading to Guddu.
With a discharge capacity of 865,000 cusecs against Trimmu’s 875,000, Panjnad is the second last destination before the tributaries merge into the mighty Indus.
Sindh Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro, who is stationed at the Sukkur Barrage to monitor floods, told
Dawn
that breaches were not an option.
“There is no option of breach in our minds,” he said, adding that Sindh’s topography tells a different story when it comes to such decisions.
“Gradient in Sindh’s lands is lower than the Indus River,” he argued, while asking people not to worry about any possible breaches. “I tell those putting this query that we can’t breach a dyke. It’s not an option,” he assured.
Peculiar gradient
Explaining this phenomenon, Tando Jam Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Altaf Siyal said there were variables in the soil gradient in Punjab and Sindh and breaching a dyke was a different story for each province.
“A breach can be made on either side of the Indus. If it occurs on the right bank, the water will head westward because those pockets have large depressions. In case of a breach on the left bank, it will impact the Nara canal of Sukkur Barrage first before heading downstream,” Dr Siyal said.
A breach around Khairpur Mirs and Naushahro Feroze would send water to the river from the Qazi Ahmed side on the left bank of the Indus.
According to him, any breach on the right bank upstream of Sukkur will send water down to Manchhar Lake via the Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD)/Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD).
“Manchhar Lake then allows the authorities to redirect water to the Indus if the river flows remain on the lower side,” he said, alluding to the 2010 super floods.
In 2010, a massive breach 60km downstream of
Guddu
displaced millions after the Tori Bund developed a fissure, affecting seven districts on the right bank. The water eventually ended up in the lake.
In 2022,
heavy rainfall
in the Kirthar Range inundated parts of the right bank districts, including Qambar-Shahdadkot, Larkana, Dadu, and Jamshoro. These flows entered the Indus after Manchhar had to be breached the same month at two locations.
A high-powered judicial commission was formed to probe the causes of the 2010 flood breaches at Tori and Molchand-Surjani at Kot Almo in Thatta, downstream of Kotri Barrage, on Aug 27, 2010.
The report mentioned that around 1.47MAF water was released from Tori and 70pc of the 150km on Begari Sindh Feeder, an off-taking channel of Guddu Barrage on its right side was destroyed.
The chief engineer of the Guddu barrage and his team, along with the irrigation secretary, were held responsible for negligence.
Discharges in Punjab
Mr Jam and Irrigation Secretary Zarif Khero also shared information about discharges recorded in Punjab, especially at Trimmu, Panjnad, Head Sidhnai over Ravi (with 157,580 cusecs discharge at 4pm Wednesday) and Sulemanki over Sutlej (122,736 cusecs). Chenab, in fact, passed a peak of 1,077,951 cusecs in the last week of August, which Sindh is now waiting for.
“Let’s see which peak reaches Guddu first. My hunch is that the time lag between barrages has increased,” he said.
Sutlej and Ravi are passing their peaks, too, and the water will head for Guddu while Indus water from Taunsa will also reach the first barrage in Sindh, adding to these discharges. Panjnad’s downstream flow was 217,447 cusecs at 6pm on Wednesday. These are the flows released from the Tarbela Dam built on the Indus.
Even the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) mentioned that 1.3m cusecs of water would reach Guddu Barrage, which has a capacity of 1.2m cusecs.
The irrigation secretary said that losses between the two reaches of the barrages needed to be factored in as well.
He also drew a parallel between this year and 2014’s Chenab flows. “A discharge of 947,000 cusecs downstream Khanki [over Chenab] on Sept 7 eventually turned out to be a flow of 453,570 cusecs at Panjnad on Sept 16 and 475,000 cusecs [inclusive of Indus flows] at Guddu on Sept 19.
He, however, assured that the government was prepared to deal with any situation involving a flow of 900,000 cusecs, considered a super flood.

the decision in the SC last Friday in person, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside and suspended during the pendency of the petition, and for the division bench to be directed to hold back from proceeding further.
The judge subsequently filed an application, a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
, for an early hearing a day ago through Advocate Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah.
The application said the judge was restrained from performing his judicial functions and could not dispense justice, despite the “settled position” in law that such a restraining order could not be passed to stop a high court judge from performing his functions.
“The case concerns the important questions of law relating to the functioning of a judge of the high court and the independence of the judiciary, which are of grave concern to any jurisdiction. Hence, urgent intervention of this court is required.
“The impugned order opens the floodgates to litigation where any pending reference/complaint/petition, against any judge, can permit a high court to prevent him from performing his function. Hence, urgent intervention of this court is required to correct course and prevent such actions from straitjacketing the performance of judges of the high court,” the application said.
It argued that the impugned order was passed without considering Dawood’s bona fide, adding that the petition was not maintainable in the absence of such bona fide.
“Hence, this determination must be made at the onset to close the door to any such mala fide litigation initiated against constitutional functionaries. The crucial decision to restrain a judge from performing his function was made without even hearing the counterposition. The petitioner was never heard. Hence, it is imperative that the objections to maintainability to the petition filed against the petitioner be considered at the very onset, to prevent the litigation from unnecessarily precluding the petitioner from dispensing justice in the high court that he serves in.
“The petitioner can only serve as a judge of the high court till a particular age, and time lost due to the operation of the impugned order cannot be regained by him. Hence, this court must urgently intervene in the matter so that the petitioner can be restored and can continue to dispense justice in the high court that he serves in,” the application said.
The judge requested that his petition be fixed for a hearing this week.
The matter is only one of the controversies plaguing the IHC since five judges — namely Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Jahangiri, Saman Rafat Imtiaz and Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan — had
submitted separate petitions
at the apex court together on Friday against a number of issues affecting the court recently, from the composition of benches to rosters to case transfers.",2025-09-23,Umer Mehtab,992,0.000134

disqualification
of its lawmakers.
Record rains in KP, which started on August 15, have
wreaked havoc
across the province. The provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan expressed his dissatisfaction with the help provided by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to the flood-affected population of KP, particularly Buner — the worst-hit area in the province — stating that the authority “did not help as much as it should have”.
“I say at this forum that we will continue to be at odds with the NDMA,” Gohar said on the floor. “I said the day-before-yesterday that the NDMA only gave us a few supplies in Buner, while 236 people have been killed, 120 are injured, and 1,470 shops and 875 homes have been destroyed.”
Gohar was interrupted by Law and Human Rights Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, terming the PTI leader’s complaint as “politics just for the sake of politics” and urging the party to focus on people’s issues.
The law minister explained that disaster response has three tiers.
“There is a district disaster management authority, which the province’s deputy commissioners run; then there is the provincial disaster management authority, which is also run by the province,” Tarar said.
“The NDMA centres around information sharing. I will provide a detailed explanation, but if the opposition asks questions for the sake of politics and then walks out, then I don’t know what assembly we are sitting in.”
Speaker Ayaz Sadiq termed it “highly regrettable” that PTI leaders complain of not being allowed to speak despite Gohar and PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser having spoken on several occasions.
When Gohar began his speech, Sadiq offered to arrange a visit for the opposition to the NDMA’s head office.
Speaking later during the session, Tarar said that Rs1.3 billion had been released to the NDMA for flood relief and other activities.
“The nation needs to work together for flood relief,” the minister said on the floor of the National Assembly. “The federal government is working with provinces on relief operations.
The minister added that the NDMA releases alerts and has a mobile app.
“We recommend that those in affected areas download the app; 92 per cent of predictions are accurate,“ he said.
“Relief has a long way to go, so we ask that the nation stand with and help those affected by floods,” Tarar said.
Ready to sit and talk on Balochistan: Tallal Chaudhry
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Affairs Tallal Chaudhry expressed the federal government’s willingness to sit with Balochistan’s leadership and political representatives for talks on the issue of missing persons.
Stating that the government had zero tolerance for any issues about the matter, the minister said, “No institution wants to be blamed nor [wants] that any agency displace people outside of the law — this cannot happen.”
Chaudhry noted that a Balochistan National Party-Mengal rally in Quetta, where a suicide bombing took place earlier this week, took place without security clearance from the interior ministry.
He said political gatherings were soft targets for terrorists, which is why the government insisted that programmes of such type needed security clearance.
The state minister also said the government, himself and the district administration were in contact with the Baloch Yakjehti Committee, which is participating in an
ongoing sit-in
in Islamabad. However, he did not mention the group by name, nor who he was in contact with.
The group is protesting for the release of
remanded
group members, including chief convener
Dr Mahrang Baloch
.
He said women from Balochistan, calling them “our sisters and daughters”, were protesting in front of the Islamabad Press Club and the government was accused of ignoring them.
“This is not the case. They are our daughters, although they are protesting on a very important road and attempts are being made to provide them security and facilitate them  despite court orders and legislation about protests from this house.”
He said the government was trying to handle the situation legally, but “unfortunately, a lot of people are going to the protest for photo sessions.”
Chaudhry alleged that the protest was “held hostage by a few women and people who used it for their own personal point scoring”.
Despite that, he said that the government was open to talks and multiple people had contacted them, but the reason for no conclusion as of yet was “many demands that the government cannot fulfil”, adding that it could not release people on bail who were under trial in the courts.",2025-09-05,Dawn.com,1244,0.000153

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943367,Regional security - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE
Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement
, signed between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, is making an impact far beyond Islamabad and Riyadh.
While there is talk of extending the bilateral pact to other states, thus creating a larger regional security framework, there has also been unnecessary speculation about the use of Pakistan’s
nuclear assets
. Indeed, the
expansion
of defence cooperation is a project worth pursuing as currently both the
Middle East
and South Asia are experiencing geopolitical volatility. But where questions about nuclear arms are concerned, Pakistan should reiterate that its atomic weapons are a deterrent, meant solely for self-defence.
Pakistan has joined military alliances earlier, including the Cold War-era Seato and Cento pacts, which put it squarely in the Western camp. In these US-led alliances, Pakistan was little more than a bit player. However, the defence pact with Riyadh is different, as Pakistan today has a combat-hardened military and much-improved defence capabilities. The country’s profile was strengthened following the
military clash
with India earlier this year, sending the message that Pakistan could defend itself against a much larger foe. All these factors, as well as the irresponsible
Israeli attack on Qatar
, likely convinced the Saudis that it was the right time to seal the deal.
Now, there are indications that the military partnership could expand. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told an interviewer that “the
doors are not closed
” on other states. As we have argued, the
Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition
could be repurposed for a larger defence role, bringing together Muslim states under one banner. Such an alliance, along the lines of Nato, would strengthen the security of all member states, and deter enemies from violating the sovereignty of Muslim and Arab countries. But the doors of membership should remain open to all Muslim states.
Meanwhile, all relevant circles should exercise caution in their words and actions. There is much speculation in the
Western media
that the Pakistan-Saudi deal would make this country’s nukes available to Riyadh — perhaps because some Saudi officials have been quoted as saying that the pact ‘encompasses all military means’. When asked about the nuclear issue, Khawaja Asif said that “our capabilities, will absolutely be available under this pact”, though he added that Pakistan remains a responsible nuclear power.
Any concerns on this front must be allayed immediately, and government officials in particular should unambiguously state that, as per Pakistan’s nuclear doctrine, the atomic weapons are meant as a deterrent.
Meanwhile, Pakistan and the other Muslim states should pool their conventional defensive resources. Numerous Muslim states in the Middle East have been attacked by Israel, while Pakistan has increasingly faced Indian aggression. A defence pact could thus make adversaries think twice about launching strikes.

He made the remarks while addressing the central Martyrs’ Day ceremony held at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, as the nation observes the Pakistan Air Force Day to honour PAF martyrs.
“He (ACM Sidhu) affirmed that Pakistan Air Force would remain committed to advancing its capabilities in space, electronic warfare, cyber technologies, niche domains and indigenous defence production to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation,” said a press release by the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The PAF solemnly observed Martyrs’ Day across all its bases nationwide, ISPR noted.
The day commenced with special prayers and recitation of the Holy Quran, “dedicated to the martyrs of the 1965 and 1971 wars, as well as to all those who have rendered the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty since the creation of Pakistan”.
Addressing the ceremony as the chief guest, ACM Sidhu underscored the proud legacy of sacrifice, courage and professionalism that defines the PAF.
He emphasised that Martyrs’ Day “symbolises the extraordinary bravery, impeccable professionalism and unparalleled spirit of sacrifice demonstrated” by the armed forces.
The air chief stressed that well-cognisant of the fast-changing security dynamics, the PAF stood committed to its mission with singularity of purpose.
“The latest link in [the] chain of victories secured by PAF in Marka-i-Haq / Bunyanum Marsoos has once more proved our will and capability to guard the aerial frontiers of our motherland,” he was quoted as saying.
As New Delhi launched deadly
air strikes
on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam
attack
, which Islamabad
denied
, PAF
downed
six Indian
jets
in retaliation. After tit-for-tat
strikes
on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a
ceasefire
.
The martyrs of Marka-i-Haq — the term used for the period of conflict with India — along with the country’s military and civilian leadership, were conferred with a total of
488 national awards
on August 14. These included eight Sitara-i-Jurat, seven Sitara-i-Basalat, 23 Tamgha-i-Basalat and 79 Imtiazi Sanad for
PAF personnel
.
In his address today, the PAF chief reiterated his firm resolve to make “every possible effort for the progress and prosperity of Pakistan in the evolving global environment”, the ISPR statement said.
Paying “heartfelt tribute” to the fallen heroes of PAF, the air chief said, “We owe our heroes an eternal debt of gratitude for their supreme sacrifices, which serve as an enduring example for future generations.“
He further expressed unwavering solidarity with the people of India-occupied Kashmir in their “legitimate and indigenous struggle for the right to self-determination”, the press release added.
ACM Sidhu also laid a floral wreath at the Martyrs’ Monument and offered fateha for the departed souls to pay homage to the martyrs.
To mark the Defence and Air Force Day, the PAF released a new song titled “Shaheen”.
President, PM hail PAF’s ‘decisive role’ during India conflict
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the PAF’s
“decisive“ role
during the
military conflict with India
in May, when the air force shot down
six
Indian jets.
“In recent history, the Pakistan Air Force, together with the armed forces, played a decisive role in Marka-i-Haq [and Bunyanum Marsoos] and the way it defeated the enemy on all fronts amazed the whole world,“ PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying by the
Associated Press of Pakistan
.
“Undoubtedly, this high-level performance of the Pakistan Air Force was a manifestation of fearless leadership, the skill of the fighter sons, superior strategy, and effective implementation of multi-faceted combat capabilities,“ he added.
“The invincible multi-faceted combat capabilities of the Pakistan Air Force are a testament to its innovation in recent years.
“I am particularly proud that the Pakistan Air Force, while keeping its glorious historical tradition alive, defeated an enemy many times larger than itself,“ the premier emphasised.
“Our heroes of the Pakistan Air Force proved with their bravery that no matter how strong and well-armed the enemy is, it can never defeat passion and courage,” he observed.
The prime minister paid tribute to the PAF’s “unparalleled performance”, observing that the martyrs’ “immortal sacrifices are illuminated in history”.
PM Shehbaz said: “Undoubtedly, the founders of the Pakistan Air Force laid its foundation as a high-class and leading institution in accordance with the vision of the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
“Pakistan Air Force continues to perform well in all professional aspects and is no less than any other air force in the world in terms of professionalism,” the premier added.
“We are proud that the Pakistan Air Force has shown its professionalism and immense strength in [the] last decades during air combat.“
In his statement, President Zardari said: “Whether it was the 1965 war or the more recent Marka-i-Haq Bunyanum Marsus, our air warriors have always risen to the challenge, giving the enemy a decisive response and filling the nation with pride.”
The president highlighted that the world had “witnessed the remarkable skill and professionalism of PAF”, hailing its evolution into a “modern, capable, and highly professional institution”.
“My heart goes out in deep respect to our martyrs and
ghazis
whose courage and sacrifices continue to inspire the nation,” President Zardari said.
He recalled: “In 1965, our air warriors, against overwhelming odds, wrote a story of extraordinary bravery and determination. Their daring actions not only defended our skies but also lifted the morale of an entire nation.
“That spirit of sacrifice and excellence remains alive in every generation of the PAF,” he added. The president paid tribute to the martyrs’ families for bearing the “greatest sacrifice of all”, as well as the warriors for their resilience and dedication.
“I am confident that the Pakistan Air Force will continue to protect our skies and sovereignty with the same resolve and passion that has always defined it.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944347/sc-says-only-sjc-can-probe-misconduct-allegations-against-superior-court-judges,SC says only SJC can probe misconduct allegations against superior court judges - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"The Supreme Court (SC) has held that only the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) can investigate allegations of misconduct against judges of the apex court and high courts, it emerged on Wednesday.
The observation was made in a detailed verdict, issued on Tuesday, a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
, in a case pertaining to the
contempt proceedings
against Additional Registrar (Judicial) Nazar Abbas.
Three Sup­reme Court judges had initiated conte­mpt proceedings against the senior staff member in January for not fixing a case regarding the jurisdiction of regular benches. The case pertained to whether regular benches of the Supreme Court could determine the constitutionality of Article 191A of the Constitution, under which the Constitutional Bench was established after the 26th Amendment.
The detailed verdict issued today, authored by Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, said that by virtue of holding a constitutional position, sub-article (5) of Article 199 of the Constitution granted immunity to SC and high court judges for acts performed within their judicial and administrative capacity.
“The constitutional scheme of immunity to the judges of the superior courts is to secure the independence of the judiciary, which is the command of Article 2A [Objectives Resolution to form part of substantive provisions] of the Constitution. It is for this reason, a judge of the same court cannot issue any kind of writ nor can take any action against another judge of the same court.”
The verdict further said: “It is well settled that a judge of the Supreme Court or of a high court is not answerable to a judge of the same court. If a judge of the superior court cannot issue a writ to another judge of the same court, how can a judge be given power to issue a direction or initiate proceedings under Article 204-2 [contempt of court] of the Constitution against a sitting judge of the same court and punish him for committing contempt of court?”
The detailed order observed that the superior judiciary were generally protected by judicial immunity for their judicial work and administrative functions with respect to the affairs of their respective courts.
However, it added that this protection was not absolute as it did not shield them from the consequences for misconduct, which was a matter of judicial administration or discipline.
It said that allegations of misconduct against superior court judges could only be dealt with under Article 209, which pertains to the powers of the SJC, by the council itself.
“Sub-article (7) of Article 209 of the Constitution bars any other forum from inquiring into matters of misconduct against a judge of the Supreme Court or of a high court. This is a substantive provision and salient feature of the Constitution,” the order noted.
The order said the “intention” of the law was “evident” that it never intended to permit a judge of a court to take any action against a judge of the same court. “Thus, no action for the contempt of court could lie against judges of the SC and of high courts by their fellow judges, respectively,” it added.
It said the superior judiciary possessed the same status and power within its hierarchy and no one was superior or inferior to issue a direction against or punish another.
The order pointed out that permitting the superior judiciary to initiate contempt proceedings against each other would “militate against the necessity of maintaining a high degree of comity amongst them”.
“The maintenance of cordial relations amongst members of the superior judiciary is important for the smooth functioning of courts. Issuing a process of contempt of court by a judge against his fellow judge would create internal conflicts, grievances and grudges amongst themselves. There would be anarchy and justice system would crumble … hence, will erode public trust. No legal system can permit the judicial system to collapse,” the order said.
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had
withdrawn
the contempt notice against Abbas on Jan 27 and referred the matter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi to deliberate whether a full court was needed to decide if contempt proceedings were needed against two committees of the apex court — the regular committee constituted under Sec­ti­on 2 of the SC Practice and Pro­cedure Act, and the constituti­o­nal committee set up under Arti­cle 191(A)(4) of the Constitution.
Section 2 of the 2023 act deals with the constitution of the benches and states that every cause, appeal or matter before the SC will be heard and disposed of by a bench constituted by the three-judge committee, consisting of the CJP, the next most senior SC judge and a SC judge nominated by the CJP from time to time.
On the same date, a six-member bench comprising Justices Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Athar Minallah, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Shahid Waheed and Musrrat Hilali had disposed of Abbas’s
intra-court appeal
requesting the court to quash the contempt proceedings initiated by the two-judge bench.
The directions made in the judgement of the two-judge bench had left the members of the six-judge bench to wonder how a smaller bench could hold judges of the appellate bench in contempt without even following the procedure meant for contempt of court.",2025-09-24,Umer Mehtab,1325,0.000159

registration exam
for foreign medical graduates, Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) has made it clear that the exam is essential for the safety of patients.
The council has claimed that the health and safety of masses is the top priority and vowed that it will never compromise on it.
It is worth mentioning here that concerns of foreign medical graduates (FMGs) are being circulated on social media and a few days ago they also held a press conference claiming that they should be allowed to practice in Pakistan.
The PMDC spokesperson stated that there were three categories of Pakistani graduates who had obtained degrees from foreign institutions mainly from Afghanistan, Central Asian Republics such as Kyrgyzstan and Iran. Most of these graduates started their foreign education when PMDC Ordinance 1962 and the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) Act 2020 were in place.
“The Parliament promulgated PMDC Act 2022 and the new council was reconstituted in April 2023. The present council has implemented several reforms to promote medical education. These initiatives not only focus on medical education in the country but also for Pakistani nationals who intend to pursue education abroad, ensuring patient safety and strengthening the national health system,” he said.
“The PMDC Act 2022 provides the Council to assess and recognise foreign medical institutions and only those graduates of foreign institutions duly recognised by PMDC are eligible for the issuance of provisional registration. These graduates may be granted provisional registration; however, it is mandatory for them to pass the National Registration Examination (NRE) before obtaining full license to practice.
The PMDC has started a rigorous process of assessment of foreign medical institutions where Pakistani students are enrolled. However, several institutions do not qualify the PMDC regulatory framework and their graduates are demanding the issuance of a provisional registration certificate for clinical services.
In the recent past, at least two medical universities from Punjab have raised serious concerns on quality of medical education of these graduates from some foreign countries,” he said.
“The present council has discussed this issue of prime public interest carefully and thoroughly. Accordingly, it was decided that only those graduates of foreign institutions duly recognised by PMDC are eligible for the issuance of provisional registration prior to NRE. All other graduates enrolled at the time of erstwhile PMDC or PMC and their institutions not yet recognised under the new law, will be issued provisional registration once they qualify for the NRE examination,” he said.
“Furthermore, only graduates of foreign institutions included in the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) accredited lists are eligible to appear in the NRE. This standard practice is also adopted by different countries. It is also important to emphasise that the requirement of passing the examination for the issuance of a provincial or full license is not a new phenomenon. In fact, it was started by the Council in early 90s under the PMDC Ordinance 1962,” the spokesperson said.
“Authorities of the medical profession of every country need to be confident that every doctor entering practice has the clinical knowledge and judgement to provide safe patient care. For example, the US requires foreign doctors to pass the USMLE, the UK requires the PLAB (or GMC approved alternatives), Canada requires the MCCQE exams and Pakistan requires the NRE for foreign graduates.
Licensing exams provide a fair, standardised way to evaluate all graduates, regardless of where they studied. Exams are taken to check whether graduates are familiar with local expectations and patients must feel assured that every doctor they see has been rigorously assessed. Licensing exams strengthen confidence in the healthcare system,” he added.

declared
that all transgender persons would be expelled from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swabi district.
“The HRCP strongly condemns the reported decision by community elders in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to form a committee aimed at expelling transgender persons from the district. Such actions are unconstitutional, discriminatory and amount to incitement to violence against an already marginalised community,” the HRCP said in a statement on X.
It added that “no citizen can be deprived of the right to reside, work or earn a livelihood anywhere in Pakistan on the basis of gender identity”.
The human rights body called on the provincial and district authorities to “immediately ensure the safety and dignity of transgender persons in Swabi and uphold their fundamental rights under the Constitution and the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2018”.
The committee of elders in question comprises the tehsil president of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Maulana Abdul Samad Haqqani and others.
From the committee, Maulana Samad has said that they want transgender persons to leave the district peacefully and earn their livelihoods elsewhere “because as long as they live here, music shows will [continue to] be arranged, negatively impacting the youth”.
Similarly, another committee member, Yasir Khan, has said that in the first phase, transgender persons would be asked to peacefully leave the district, and if that doesn’t happen, district police would be approached.
Committee members have also said that they would likely meet in the next few days and separately would also hold a meeting with the district police to discuss a strategy for “expelling” transgender persons from the district.
The development came after police
arrested
more than 200 individuals, including two transgender persons, in Swabi for allegedly resisting a raid and participating in a music programme. The participants of the event have also been accused of using “abusive language” against the police over the latter’s bid to stop the event.
Responding to the 11-member committee’s demand for transgender persons’ expulsion, some individuals from the transgender community released a video asserting that the expulsion would never happen.
Saying that they respected and followed local norms and values while earning a living, they stressed that the committee members should not take the law into their hands.
The transgender persons said they were “aware of the law and the Constitution, and if they were given government jobs, they were ready to stop dancing at functions.”
They added that they should be viewed keeping humanity in mind.",2025-09-14,Imran Gabol,691,0.000112

• ‘Historic’ mutual defence accord proclaims aggression against one will be considered attack on both partners
• New pact comes on heels of shift towards collective security in Middle East; formalises commitments that had existed in practice
• PM inaugurates ‘Pakistan TV Digital’ to carry country’s perspective to international audiences
ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia have entered into a landmark
mutual defence agreement
, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both.
The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday.
According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieving security and peace in the region and the world”.
“[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details.
Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an
Arab summit
that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of
Israel’s attack
on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries.
Official Saudi media outlets also carried reports of the signing ceremony, but they offered no further details about the accord or its provisions.
A high-level delegation, including Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik, PM’s Special Assistant Tariq Fatemi and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, accompanied PM Shehbaz.
Saudi F-15 fighter jets escorted the PM’s plane after it entered the Kingdom’s airspace, and a special ceremony was held at the royal palace ahead of Pakistani delegation’s talks with the crown prince.
Upgrade in defence ties
The agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades. Cooperation between the two states dates back to 1967 and deepened after the
1979 Grand Mosque seizure
, when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram.
In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms.
In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In Feb, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges.
The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella though finer details of the agreement were not made public.
For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider.
For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time.
Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded.
Today, Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkey and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses.
Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represents Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.
To celebrate the solemnisation of the defence accord with Saudi Arabia, the Capital Development Authority decked out prominent buildings in Islamabad with green lighting.
Buildings such as the Supreme Court, Islamabad High Court, Parliament House, Cabinet Secretariat, Prime Minister’s House, and the Diplomatic Enclave along Constitution Avenue, as well as prominent hotels and commercial centres were emblazoned with emerald hues.
Digital channel launched
Earlier on Wednesday, PM Shehbaz also inaugurated ‘Pakistan TV Digital’, an English news channel aimed at delivering Pakistani voice to the world and offering the country’s perspective on national and international developments, besides countering anti-Pakistan narratives and propaganda.
During the visit to the offices of
Pakistan TV Digital
, housed on the premises of state-run
Pakistan Television
(
PTV
), the prime minister unveiled a plaque to launch the news channel, which aims to enable Pakistan to communicate with the world, and deliver its perspective.
He said that the primary objective of launching this digital news channel was to provide authentic coverage, while effectively countering misinformation and propaganda about Pakistan.
PM Shehbaz also recorded his first interview for broadcast on
Pakistan TV Digital
, which is reportedly a subsidiary of
PTV

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943478/wasa-sends-rs72-billion-budget-for-approval-to-lahore,Wasa sends Rs7.2 billion budget for approval to Lahore - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"RAWALPINDI: The Rawalpindi Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) on Saturday submitted its annual budget worth Rs7.2 billion to Punjab Wasa for final approval.
According to budget documents, Wasa’s total income stood at Rs3.792bn from its own sources, including water and sewerage charges, while Rs2.233bn was received from the Punjab government for development schemes.
Total expenditure has been estimated at Rs5.002bn.
Wasa Managing Director Muhammad Saleem Ashraf told
Dawn
that the Punjab government had appointed Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema as Chairman Wasa.
Agency intensifies recovery drive, issues arrest warrants for chronic defaulters
After vetting, the chairman forwarded the budget to Punjab Wasa Lahore for final approval.
He said Wasa was a self-sustaining organisation and met its expenses from its own resources.
“The income generated through bills will be used for improving the water supply system in the garrison city,” he said.
A major portion of the budget, he added, was consumed by electricity bills for more than 480 tube wells and staff salaries. “We are trying to reduce expenditures, but electricity rates increase two or three times a year, making it difficult,” he said.
To improve income, Wasa set a recovery target of Rs2.371bn for the fiscal year 2024-25 from domestic and commercial consumers, but the actual recovery crossed Rs3bn.
“In the last fiscal year 2023-24, the recovery target was Rs1.570bn, against which Rs1.717bn was collected. However, in 2024-25, more than Rs3bn was recovered in just 11 months, which is a significant achievement,” he said.
The MD said there were 134,681 consumers in the garrison city, of which 96,971 regularly paid their bills. Recovery teams had been tasked with ensuring that all consumers were brought into the paying category.
The improved recovery, he explained, was due to a new plan under which special revenue recovery teams were formed to recover arrears from chronic defaulters, both commercial and domestic, without discrimination.
“I have given a special task to the recovery teams to ensure 100 per cent recovery of arrears from all defaulters, and no shortcomings in revenue recovery will be tolerated,” he said.
Wasa Rawalpindi has also launched operations against chronic defaulters. Senior Special Magistrate Wasa Rawalpindi, Aamir Ashfaq Qureshi, issued arrest warrants for five defaulters, including a resident of New Parian (Rs222,712), another of Raja Sultan locality (Rs425,869) and three more residents of New Parian with dues of Rs189,853, Rs312,251, and Rs187,213, respectively.
The MD said defaulters had been repeatedly sent notices to pay their dues, but after their continued non-payment, arrest warrants were finally issued. He also directed revenue officials to disconnect water connections of all defaulters immediately.
Defaulters have been given a final chance to clear their arrears. After this, late fees and installment options will be withdrawn, and further action will include attachment of property, arrests, and shutdown of water and sewerage services.
The MD appealed to consumers to prove themselves responsible citizens by paying their dues on time. He expressed determination that the crackdown would continue until the last defaulter was brought into compliance, adding that no pressure would be tolerated in this regard.

The spokesperson said attackers opened indiscri­minate fire with automatic weapons, but police personnel at the post retaliated, killing three of the terrorists on the spot.
This was the

on police personnel in the Bannu division in the last week.
The bodies of the atta­c­k­ers and the injured offi­cer, Inam, were shifted to Mir Ali Hospital. Sources at the hospital said the injured officer was in critical condition.
Following the attack, a large number of security forces and police cordoned off the area and launched an operation to trace facilitators, according to official sources.
Witnesses said the exch­ange of fire caused panic in the area, leading to the closure of shops and hou­ses. However, they later pra­ised the police for their response.
“The personnel risked their lives and sav­ed the entire area from a major disaster,” they said.
The funeral prayers for the martyred police official, Nizamullah, was later offered at Governor Cottage in Miramshah.
It was attended by senior government and military officials, as well as a large number of local residents.
He was presented a gua­rd of honour by a police contingent and laid to rest with official honours.
“Our son sacrificed his life for the sake of the country and we are proud of his martyrdom, but the government should also pay attention to problems of the martyrs’ families,” family members told the media.
Local tribal elders also demanded that the government ensure the upbringing of the constable’s children and provide immediate financial assistance to the family.
Police officials said an investigation is underway.

• Entire union council of 40,000 submerged in Alipur tehsil
• 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts affected; relief and rehabilitation underway
LAHORE: While water levels have begun to recede significantly in some areas of south Punjab, with the Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils of Multan declared safe after a major flood wave
passed
through Head Panjnad, officials said evacuation and relief efforts continued from low-lying areas along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.
As many as 12,427 people were evacuated from low-lying areas along the three rivers in what authorities claimed one of the largest operations in recent history, involving a fleet of 1,517 rescue boats.
According to Punjab Rescue spokesperson Farooq Ahmed, the districts of Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan were among the hardest hit, with 3,274, 2,392 and 414 people rescued, respectively.
Evacuations extended across numerous other districts, including Lodhran, Bahawalpur and Kasur, illustrating the widespread nature of the crisis. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) reported that a staggering 2.5 million people have been evacuated from Punjab so far, with the floods claiming 101 lives and necessitating the rescue of 2.19m cattle heads.
Officials confirmed that water levels have begun to recede significantly in some areas. The government declared the tehsils of Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad, where water flow dropped dramatically from 684,000 cusecs on Friday night to 492,695 cusecs by Saturday evening, a decrease of nearly 200,000 cusecs in 24 hours.
The PDMA said that flows at most major headworks on all three rivers were “steady”.
Despite the improving situation, the humanitarian crisis remains severe. The entire union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, with a population of 40,000, was completely submerged.
Lati Mari resident Syed Kausar Shah told
Dawn
that around 15,000 people of his basti Azeem Shah evacuated on their own as the water started approaching their union council.
He said that all their houses and crops were destroyed due to an extremely high flood, and two people from the families who could not evacuate in time were drowned.
He said that a private boat was hired to evacuate the people. “Most of them were living in the houses of their relatives in Alipur city, some were also sitting on the dyke under the sky while others shifted to government relief camps,” he added.
The flood-affected people also suffered losses of cattle heads, as most of them could not evacuate their cattle. He said that six to seven feet of water is still flowing in their union council and they could not take away their belongings and also were not able to check whether it was safe or not.
Multan DC Waseem Hamid Sindhu said that 100,000 people were evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala in the the last three days. He said that efforts were being made to fill the breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala and helicopters and drones were being used to transport medicine and dry food to remote areas.
He said that Jalalpur city was made safe, and the major flood wave of the Chenab and Sutlej rivers was crossing the Head Panjnad. He said that relief and rehabilitation of the flood-affected people had started, and food was being distributed through boats in rural areas of the city.
High-level flooding
Addressing a press conference in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that Panjnad Headworks is facing extremely high flood, with the water flow reaching 575,000 cusecs. He said that 80,000 cusecs of water receded at Panjand in some hours, and a maximum of 700,000 cusecs crossed three days ago.
He said that the Sutlej River had swelled to 385,000 cusecs this season, and all three rivers of the province simultaneously created high-level flooding.
He said that there was no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities and water would also recede in Bahawalpur in the next 24 hours. A “historic” evacuation operation was conducted in Jalalpur Pirwala, and forced evacuation would have been conducted in the district of Multan, he added.
The DG said that 4,447 mouzas of 28 districts were affected due to flood water and 2.5m people were evacuated from Punjab. He said that 101 people lost their lives in floods and 2.19m cattle heads were also evacuated in the province and shifted to safe places.
Water flow
According to the Flood Forecasting Division’s data released at 9pm on Saturday, the water flow across major rivers was largely normal and steady.
On the Chenab River, flows are steady at all key locations, including Marala Headworks (62,081 cusecs), Khanki Head­works (65,049 cusecs), Qadirabad Headworks (64,588 cusecs) and Tri­mmu Headworks (100,645 cusecs). The flow at Panjnad Headworks was at 492,695 cusecs but was falling. The water level at Rivaz Bridge was 517.20 feet, which was steady and below its maximum level of 525 feet.
On the Ravi River, the water outflow was normal at Jassar (13,797 cusecs), Shahdara (14,906 cusecs) and Balloki Headworks (27,970 cusecs), but it was in low flood at Sidhnai Headworks at 40,809 cusecs.
On the Sutlej River, the water flow was in medium flood at Ganda Singh Wala Headworks (95,000 cusecs) and Islam Headworks (82,155 cusecs), while it was in low flood at Sulemanki Headworks (69,019 cusecs).

An ATC in Rawalpindi was hearing a case against Imran pertaining to an attack on the army’s General Headquarters GHQ) on May 9, 2023, when the PTI founder’s arrest had sparked violent protests across the country, during which state buildings and military installations were torched and vandalised.
During today’s hearing, Imran was included via a WhatsApp call, following the court’s
dismissal
of a plea for his in-person appearance last week.
His lawyers, Salman Akram Raja and Faisal Malik, sought Judge Amjad Ali Shah’s permission to talk to the ex-premier. But during the call, Imran’s voice was disrupted and his face appeared blurred on screen, leading his lawyers to boycott the court proceedings.
They stated that such a trial was “unfair”.
The court, however, recorded the statements of eight witnesses, including the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority additional director, the Federal Investigation Agency’s technical assistant and the Pakistan Information Department deputy director.
For their part, the PTI lawyers said they “rejected” the recording of witnesses’ statements in this manner.
The court then adjourned the hearing, summoning more witnesses on September 27.
Imran was
indicted
in the case on December 5 last year. The PTI founder, who has been incarcerated in Adiala Jail since August 2023, was
arrested
by the Rawalpindi police in the May 9 protest case in January 2024.
PTI files plea
After boycotting the court proceedings, Raja also expressed his grievances during his interaction with the media.
“A mobile phone was placed before Khan
sahib
in jail, on which a video call was made. On this side, the judge received the call on a phone he had,” he said. He added that during the call Imran could not hear what was being said in the court and those present in the courtroom could not hear him.
“Then obviously, Khan
sahib
is unaware of the testimonies being recorded,” he said.
He also shared that they had requested the judge to let them talk to Imran, but they were unable to do so. “The judge said that [we] were unable to talk [to Imran] because the link was very weak.”
He also highlighted that they had the right to talk to Imran alone. “But this right, too, was denied,” he added.
Raja said they had prepared an application, which Malik would be submitting to the court.
“And we have conveyed to the court that it is not possible for us to remain a part of this process … There should be an open trial and the accused should be given the chance to talk to his lawyers,” he continued.
Raja said that they had also filed a plea “against this process” with the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi bench.",2025-09-23,Tahir Naseer,728,0.000115

In a statement, he claimed that the case was completely baseless, an act of revenge and a form of oppression. He demanded immediate withdrawal of the case and the release of the ‘innocent’ shopkeepers.
He said the shopkeepers belonged to the flood-affected villages and were living in desperate conditions after bearing losses. He said that at such a time, these actions were rubbing salt on their wounds. He announced that traders would raise their voice against this injustice and would take to the streets.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941376/ihc-cj-to-hear-petition-against-fellow-judges-fake-degree,IHC CJ to hear petition against fellow judge’s ‘fake degree’ - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) has fixed for hearing a petition challenging the appointment of one of its own sitting judges, Justice Tariq Mah­mood Jahangiri, over
allegations
of possessing an invalid law degree.
A two-member bench, led by Chief Justice Sar­dar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, will hear on September 16 the petition filed by Advocate Mian Dawood.
The petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeks a writ of quo warranto (by what authority) against Justice Jahangiri, arguing that his foundational qualification for judicial office — an LLB degree from the University of Karachi — is “invalid”, thereby rendering his entire legal career and subsequent appointment illegitimate.
The petitioner has bas­ed his case on official correspondence from the Uni­versity of Karachi, which is attached as evidence.
Justice Dogar’s predecessor had reserved judgement on maintainability of plea; fresh hearings will delve into substantive allegations
The petition was initially filed earlier this year. Former IHC CJ Aamer Farooq had reserved judgement on the preliminary issue of whether the petition was maintainable.
With the case now listed for a fresh hearing before a new bench, the court is poised to potentially delve into the substantive allegations.
The key allegations include use of dual enrollment numbers, as the record shows two different enrollment numbers for Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I and Part-II examinations. The University of Karachi has previously stated that it is “impossible to allot two enrollment numbers to a student for one programme”.
The enrolment number AIL-5968/87, which appears on Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I mark sheet, was officially allocated by the university to another individual, Imtiaz Ahmad, son of Muhammad Ellahi.
Furthermore, the principal of Government Islamia Law College, Karachi, stated in a letter that a student named “Tariq Mehmood s/o Qazi Muhammad Akram”, under enrolment number AIL-7124/87, was never admitted to the college for the LLB programme during the relevant period.
In addition, the Controller of Examinations at the University of Karachi concluded in an official letter that the degree and mark sheets in question are “invalid”.
The petition argues that the appointment of a judge without the requisite legal qualification is not just an administrative error, but a violation of the fundamental rights of all citizens.
Citing judgments like the Sajjad Ali Shah case, the petitioner contended that the presence of a judge with an allegedly invalid degree “shakes public confidence” and “tarnishes the image of the judiciary as a neutral arbiter”.
It may be recalled that Justice Jahangiri is one of the five judges who
challenged
the transfer of Justice Dogar, along with two other judges —Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Asif — to the Islamabad High Court.
He was also among the cohort that, last year, wrote a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council, alleging interference by intelligence agencies in the judicial matters.
Days before the controversy over his degree initially surfaced, Justice Jahangiri was expeditiously hearing election petitions against alleged rigging in all three constituencies of Islamabad.

Dawn
has learnt.
Currently, police have been deployed in several villages, including Hasil Sarho, Nasirpur Matan, Chak Araiyan, Chak Nurpur in Minchinabad tehsil.
The irrigation and police sources alleged that some influential landlords were breaking dykes to minimise damage to hundreds of acres of their lands, endangering the entire area. However, due to resistance from other residents of the areas, groups have emerged among them.
Shehar Farid Station House Officer Sajjad Ahmad told
Dawn
that clashes had also erupted in almost 40 villages of Chishtian, where several small and large dykes were established.
He said people tried to break these dykes to remove water from their area, however, people of adjacent localities resisted their efforts. This later turned into serious disputes and the administration had so far registered cases against 42 people involved in clashes, he added.
Landlords accused of illegally breaching dykes to save farmland
Although the water level in the Sutlej decreased from 130,000 cusecs to 127,000 cusecs in the last three days, according to the irrigation and revenue sources, protective dykes were built in inappropriate places in a non-technical manner, and they could not withstand the rapid flow of water for long. As a result, dozens of dykes broke which increased the number of affected villages from 134 to 143 within the past three days, they said.
The water level in the Sutlej is at its highest level of 138,000 cusecs. However, the district administration, in a recent notification, issued an alert about further increase in the water level in the river and appealed to the public to take precautionary measures.
A report issued by the DC office on Monday, a copy of which is available with
Dawn
, stated that more than 100,000 acres of agricultural land had been affected by the floods, while the number of people displaced from the affected areas had reached 129,553. It said that 12,557 people and 47,614 livestock had been rescued from the affected areas so far.
Talking to
Dawn
, Bahawalnagar Deputy Commissioner Zoulfiqar Ahmad expressed the hope about controlling the flood situation and also hinted at taking strict measures to stop breach of protective dykes or canals.
He said people planning to break protective dykes or canals had been strictly warned, and strict action would be taken against those involved in such activities.

Speaking at the Women Empowerment Expo 2025, organised by the Cultural Centre of Iran, the governor said that empowered women are already playing an active role in several sectors of life, but efforts are underway to provide them with even greater opportunities.
“Through joint efforts of both men and women, we can achieve new heights of progress and prosperity. Such harmony will not only benefit women but the entire society,” Mr Mandokhail said.
He praised the Iranian Cultural Centre for hosting the event, calling it a commendable initiative to highlight the importance of empowering women.
While highlighting shared values of Pakistan and Iran as neighbouring brotherly countries, the governor said: “Just as Iran has courageously resisted Israel, Pakistan too compelled India to surrender within just three days. Now, both Israel and India will think many times before attacking any Muslim nation.”
“Empowering women goes beyond granting them formal rights or offering traditional respect — it means recognising them as equal human beings,” Mr Mandokhail said, adding that it is the need of the hour to ensure women’s representation and participation in all fields of life.

The initial estimates of the flood damage will be finalised within the next ten days, the planning minister said, adding the verified data would be shared soon. Ahsan Iqbal said that like the
2022 floods
, a comprehensive post-disaster needs assessment of damage and requirements would be carried out with the participation of international organisations.
In a separate meeting, PM Sheh­baz stressed that after the assessm­e­­nt, the government could formulate a comprehensive rehabilitation stra­tegy by effectively carrying out rest­oration efforts in the affected areas.
Federal and inter-provincial institutions should fully cooperate with each other in assessing these damages, the PM stressed. In addition to the loss of lives and properties, he emphasised that damages to crops and livestock should also be included in the assessment reports.
He suggested that assistance could be taken from the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Rese­arch Commission for satellite-based assessment, while immediate steps should be taken to protect crops from various diseases after flooding.
He said that special measures should be taken for the cultivation of suitable crops in the flood-affected areas. The prime minister was informed that damage assessment of the sugarcane, cotton and rice crops would be completed in two weeks once the water receded.
Sutlej threat to Multan district
Meanwhile, the Sutlej River continued to inundate Jalalpur Pirwala villages amid mass evacuations. As the river threatened the urban settlements of Jalalpur, the Multan district administration launched an operation to protect these neighbourhoods by building and reinforcing protective dykes along Gilani Road and Shujaabad Road. A breach on Shujaabad Road was swiftly filled using heavy machinery.
The construction of temporary embankments comes as water levels in the Chenab River recede, causing Sutlej’s water to flow towards urban settlements of the tehsil.
Meanwhile, the Jalalpur section of the Multan-Uch Sharif motorway was submerged at over five locations, while efforts were also ongoing to drain water from the Jalalpur Pirwala Motorway M5 Interchange and adjacent areas.
Multan Deputy Commissioner (DC) Waseem Hamid Sindhu visited Alipur, Khan Bela and adjacent embankments with a technical team and ordered the construction of temporary embankments to contain the flooded Sutlej.
Meanwhile, the evacuation of people continued in Multan and Muzaffargarh districts and Rescue 1122 teams have rescued 28,732 people and 2,998 head of cattle. As many as 9,304 people and 2,998 animals were rescued in Multan and 19,428 people from the Muzaffargarh district along the Chenab.
As many as 34 people and 14 animals were taken to safe places from Multan during the last 24 hours. The teams also evacuated 24,004 people and 4,437 animals in Jalalpur Pirwala, with 1,144 people and 607 animals during the last 24 hours.
Muzaffargarh Rescue 1122 media coordinator Mansoor Ahmad said that the rescue operation continued in the adjacent low-lying areas near the Chenab and 19,428 people were shifted to safe places. “These areas include Bait Kundrala, Mudwala, Seetpur, Sarki, Khangarh Doma, Lati Marhi, Azmatpur, Mullanwali, Kundai, Juna Bangla, Rangpur, Muradabad, Khadkan, Binda Ishaq, and Hamzaywali,” he added.
Two Sehwan villages submerged
In Sindh’s Sehwan, two more villages were submerged as 400,000 cusecs flowed towards Korti Barrage on the Indus. The floodwaters cut off road access to these villages, severing them from Sehwan.
Meanwhile, residents of Waryam Sehto and Aarab Otho villages were seen relocating their livestock and belongings toward safer areas using boats. However, one of the boats malfunctioned during the evacuation. Upon receiving the alert, Rescue 1122 swiftly responded and managed to rescue 35 people along with their livestock and essential household items.
According to the current situation, the water level continues to show a decreasing trend, with inflow at 609,137 cusecs and outflow at 580,927 cusecs at Guddu Barrage.
At Sukkur Barrage, inflow was recorded at 571,800 cusecs, while outflow is at 518,120 cusecs. Besides, the water level showed an increase, with inflow at 300,853 cusecs and outflow at 289,098 cusecs at Kotri Barrage. According to officials, inflow was recorded at 234,755 cusecs, while outflow was at 229,905 cusecs at the Punjab head (Panjnad).

Pakistan experienced unprecedented
floods
and landslides this year amid record monsoon rains, triggered by climate change. The country’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reports that since late June, more than 1,000 people have been killed, with nearly 1,100 left injured due to monsoon-related disasters.
Back in 2022, the country faced widespread devastation because of the floods,  which killed 1,700 people, wiped off swathes of agricultural land, displaced millions, and incurred losses worth
$30 billion
, according to governmental estimates. Following the disaster, Pakistan held an international donors’ conference in Geneva, asking the world to help fund its flood recovery.
Earlier this year, the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs was told that out of the
$10 billion pledged
to Pakistan by various countries, only $500 million came as a grant, with the remainder extended as loans, as reported by
Profit
.
“Loans over loans, [and] adding to loans is not a solution,” the prime minister said while speaking at the Special Climate Event convened by United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, along with the president of Brazil — the host of COP 30 — for member states to present new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) with targets for the year 2035.
PM Shehbaz expressed Pakistan’s commitment to be part of the solution to the climate crisis, hoping that the international community would also honour its commitment for the sake of the country’s future generations.
He reminded delegates that Pakistan was still reeling from the scars of the
2022 floods
, which inflicted losses exceeding $30bn and displaced millions.
“This year, intense monsoon rains, cloudbursts, flash floods and devastating urban flooding have impacted more than five million people, destroyed 4,100 villages, and claimed over 1,000 precious lives,” he added.
Highlighting Pakistan’s minimal contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, the prime minister said that despite a negligible contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, “we bear impacts far beyond our share”.
However, he stated that the country’s commitment to delivering on its climate agenda remained steadfast and unwavering.
In 2022, Pakistan was
ranked
among the most vulnerable countries to climate change.
“In our 2021 Nationally Determined Contribution, Pakistan committed to an unconditional 15 per cent reduction in projected greenhouse gas emissions by 2030,“ he said.
As part of the overall target of cutting emissions by 50pc, he shared that Pakistan had already delivered on its unconditional pledge of a 15pc reduction.
“Renewables are presently providing over 32pc of Pakistan’s power mix. Solar energy has grown sevenfold since 2021,” the prime minister added.
Furthermore, he emphasised that 23,000 hectares of mangrove forests had been restored.
He regretted, however, that the implementation of Pakistan’s national adaptation plan was “hampered, and hampered severely, due to
inadequate
international climate finance”.
PM Shehbaz announced an increase in the share of renewables and hydropower to 62pc of the country’s energy mix by 2035, expanding nuclear energy capacity by 1,200 megawatts by 2030, shifting 30pc of transport to cleaner mobility by 2030 and establishing 3,000 charging stations nationwide.
He also announced the scaling up of climate-smart agriculture, safeguarding of water security, and advancement of the plantation of 1bn trees.
Earlier, in his remarks, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that it was still possible to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees by century’s end.
He told the gathering that clean energy was powering jobs, growth and sustainable development, besides generating the fastest and cheapest electricity and insulating economies from volatile fossil fuel markets.
“The bottom line: clean is competitive, and climate action is imperative,” he remarked.
He said that the
Paris Agreement
had made a difference as in the last 10 years, adding, “Now, we need new plans for 2035 that go much further, and much
faster
.”
The UN chief stressed that “
COP30
in Brazil must conclude with a credible global response plan to get us on track and “show a credible path to mobilising the $1.3tr annually in climate finance by 2035, as
agreed
at COP29 in Baku”, including identifying funding sources, making finance accessible, and ensuring accountability.
He also underlined that “developing countries that did least to cause the crisis are suffering most”, calling for “effective debt relief and scaled-up solutions like debt swaps and disaster pause clauses”.",2025-09-25,APP,1217,0.000151

However, the city’s main commercial areas returned to normalcy after clearance of water and the traders resumed their businesses in Muslim Bazaar, on Circular Road, GT Road and other adjoining localities.
Skin diseases, throat infections and gastroenteritis have also surfaced in the main affected areas of the city.
The crucial areas like Jinnah Road, Jail Road, Rehman Shaheed Road, Ghareebpura, Khawajgan Road, Prince Chowk, Shah Hussain Shafiabad, Bara Dari, Jalalpur Jattan Road, Zahoor Elahi Stadium Market and many other areas remained submerged with the floodwater throughout the day. The situation was still the same when this report was filed at night.
Some major areas still under water; 11 booked for breaching dykes near Daulat Nagar
Some locals forcibly breached the dykes near Malhu Khokhar and DC embankment on Sunday night, diverting the floodwater again towards the Gujrat city.
However, the authorities reached there and again started the efforts to plug these breaches by Monday morning.
On the directions of the Gujrat DC, the police have booked 11 people, including a retired sub-inspector of police, on the charges of breaching the embankment at Malhu Khokhar. The case has been lodged with Daulat Nagar Police Station against a nominated suspect Fiaz Ahmed and his 10 unidentified accomplices.
The local traders have suffered huge losses after floodwater entered their shops and stayed there for at least five to six days as they could not even open their shops.
The patients and attendants of some private hospitals on the Jail Road and adjoining localities too were among the worst-affected people due to the severe flooding.
Meanwhile, Punjab Minister for Local Bodies Mian Zeeshan Rafique, Gujranwala Commissioner Naveed Haider, Gujrat Deputy Commissioner Nurulain Qureshi and District Police Officer Rana Umar Farooq visited the different sore spots of the city as well as the points from where the floodwater entered it.
A spokesman for the housing department said efforts were underway to clear the city of the urban flooding within the next few hours.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945490/55pc-milk-samples-in-karachi-found-adulterated-with-harmful-chemicals,55pc milk samples in Karachi found adulterated with harmful chemicals - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"• Sindh Food Authority claims 71 of 127 samples laced with detergent, salt, sugar, or watered down
• Commissioner orders crackdown on milk sellers
• Dairy farmers reject findings, demand Rs50 per litre price hike
KARACHI: While dairy farmers want a massive increase in the per-litre milk price, the city administration on Monday made public the disturbing findings of a recent exercise to check the quality of milk available in the city, announcing that over 55 per cent of the samples — 71 out of 127 — were found to be laced with harmful chemicals posing significant health risks to consumers.
Officials said that the Sindh Food Authority (SFA) had recently obtained 127 milk samples from as many shops across the city and sent them to a food testing laboratory.
They said that as many as 15 samples were found laced with detergent and 19 others with added water. Besides, they said that 22 samples of fresh milk contained salt and 12 others sugar.
Explaining the nature of the chemicals, the officials said that detergent was added to milk to deceive consumers by creating a false appearance of quality and increasing its perceived thickness and frothiness.
They said that the fraudulent practice was
common
in the city and had serious health consequences, as detergents are harsh cleaning chemicals that could cause irritation, gastrointestinal issues, and long-term damage to organs such as the kidneys and liver.
They said that the widespread adulteration posed significant health risks to consumers and prompted the authorities to launch an immediate crackdown on vendors and shops selling milk laced with harmful chemicals and added water.
Details collated from the SFA revealed that out of 43 fresh milk samples collected in South district, 22 were found adulterated.
Similarly, in Malir, 15 out of 20 samples were adulterated; in East, 7 out of 16; in Keamari, 7 out of 13; in West, 4 out of 7; in Central, 2 out of 12; and in Korangi, 14 out of 16 samples were found adulterated.
Crackdown launched
The officials said that the administration on Monday launched a massive crackdown on fresh milk vendors and shops, as a staggering 55pc of samples tested positive for adulteration and contamination.
They said that a high-level meeting chaired by Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi at his office, and attended among others by officials of the SFA, decided to gear up efforts to contain the sale of adulterated fresh milk in the city on an emergency basis.
The officials said that the commissioner had directed all deputy commissioners to take immediate and strict action against those involved in selling adulterated milk in the city.
They said that so far at least four milk shops had been sealed, while the action was still in progress.
Dairy farmers reject findings
The crackdown coincided with the demand of dairy farmers for an immediate increase of Rs50 per litre in milk prices in view of widespread damage from recent flooding in Sindh and Punjab.
They also warned of protests outside the Chief Minister’s House if a new price notification was not issued by Oct 1.
According to Dairy Farmers Association Vice President Chaudhry Farooq, essential feed such as straw is no longer reaching Karachi due to
flooding
in rural areas, and the cost of available fodder has more than doubled.
Spokesperson for the All Karachi Milk Retailers Welfare Association, Waheed Gaddi, rejected the SFA’s claims regarding the sampling and testing of milk and said that the whole proceedings were an eye-wash.
Talking to
Dawn
, he said that food inspectors from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation used to collect milk samples in three bottles, each containing a quarter of a litre, and add chemicals before sealing them in the vendor’s presence. “The vendor was given one bottle for potential re-testing to challenge the findings,” he added.
It may be recalled that in early May, the SFA had
claimed
that the milk and tea leaves used by almost every tea shop and stall across the city had been found to be alarmingly contaminated with harmful chemicals and substances.
According to the SFA, 90pc of milk samples collected in May in different areas were found adulterated and contaminated with chemicals and added water.
As per the SFA, it had inspected as many as 127 tea shops and stalls in different parts of Karachi to collect samples of the milk and tea.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942537,‘Nuclear arsenal keeps Indian designs in check’ - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: A top adviser to the country’s nuclear command and control body believes that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal is what is keeping Indian military designs in check.
Speaking at an event organised by the Islamabad Policy Research  Institute (IPRI) on Tuesday, retired Lt Gen Khalid Ahmed Kidwai said that the country’s Full Spectrum Deterrence  (FSD) — or minimum credible deterrence — was never compromised during  the May standoff with India.
Lt Gen Kidwai, an adviser to the country’s National Command Authority (NCA), also noted that the newly-formed
Army Rocket Force Command
(ARFC)  will raise the nuclear threshold by providing an additional layer of  strategic deterrence between conventional operations and the potential  employment of nuclear forces.
He explained that the ARFC has merely a response to modern battlefield needs, while the nuclear deterrent remains in place as the ultimate  shield against India.
A former head of the army’s Strategic Plans Division (SPD), Gen. Kidwai said that Pakistan’s FSD worked in both directions, east and west, and it was no ‘bluff’, according to a press release issued after the event.
He stressed that, unlike India, Pakistan has repeatedly demonstrated that restraint and responsibility are the key components of its nuclear policy.
“The large size of the Indian army does not tell the entire story… quality, technology, and training are the force multipliers that determine the victor in an armed confrontation,” he remarked.
“India not only failed to achieve any of its politico-strategic-military objectives, but it also suffered major military reverses, especially in the IAF,” he pointed out.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940637,Understanding wild behaviour - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: Wild animals don’t normally hurt human beings intentionally, says wildlife expert Vaqar Zakaria.
Yet, one swipe of the arm from a brown bear can inflict serious damage, even if their intent is not to harm.
Following a
brown bear atta­­ck
on singer Quratulain Baloch (QB) while she was in Deosai, Mr Zakaria told
Dawn
that although the local brown bear isn’t as big as its Alaskan cousin, its claws — typically around two inches long — are razor-sharp and capable of tearing flesh with ease.
“Maybe the bear thought there was food nearby, and the singer’s first reaction — screams for help — triggered the aggression,” he speculated, calling it a “rare and isolated incident”.
Dr Shafqat Hussain, Profes­sor of Anthropology at Trinity College in Hartford, Connec­ti­cut, was not too surprised by the bear attack. “Though unfo­rtunate, it was bound to happen sooner or later,” he said.
In wake of singer QB’s close call with a brown bear in Deosai, experts stress that people should never feed wild animals; blame human intervention for wildlife losing its ‘natural shyness’
Known for his work on snow leopard conservation in Gilgit-Baltistan, he warned that since bears are attracted to food which is available in human camps “more is to come if we continue glamping at Deosai”.
When QB was approached for comment, she requested “pri­­vacy for the healing process”.
“To ask a traumatised person to stay still, upon seeing a grizzly visitor inside the tent, is not very realistic — but that’s the best thing to do,” Zakaria noted.
According to him, TikTok videos, selfies, and a taste for human food are some of the reasons why wild animals lose their natural shyness and start venturing closer to human settlements.
Above all, he blames the people for encroaching into territories that have historically been the habitat of wild animals.
There are fundamental differences between humans and wildlife, he says. “Animals attack or kill for a reason; humans often do so for none. Bears, almost never.”
Yet one key similarity rem­ains — unpredictability.
“You never really know what might happen, or what could trigger ‘wild’ behaviour. We simply don’t know them well enough to anticipate it,” he said.
Human encroachment
The Deosai Plains, spanning about 3,600 sq km between Skardu and Astore in the Karakoram range, were declared a national park by the government in 1993. It is home to brown bears, marmots (squirrels), foxes, wolves, over two dozen species of birds and a vibrant variety of alpine flowers.
“If you cast a line in the streams, you will catch a fish within five minutes, and the water is clean enough for drinking,” Zakaria says.
To manage this unique ecosystem, the Islamabad-based Hi­­malayan Wildlife Founda­ti­­on (IWF) was asked to develop a management plan by the Gil­git-Baltistan Wildlife Depart­ment, marking core zones, grazing areas, camping sites and more.
As its co-founder, Zakaria has spent over three decades studying brown bears, tracking their movements, population, diet and behaviour — not just in Deosai but around the world — and continues to collaborate with international bear experts.
“In 1993, around 20 jeeps would visit the park every day in summers,” he recalled. By the year 2000, traffic had picked up. Today, up to 500 vehicles enter the park daily during peak season, he added.
“We need to accept that humans are occupying their territory, not the other way around,” he said.
He also blames people, tourists and locals alike, for altering and even degrading habitats — cutting forests, increasing livestock and then leaving them unattended in open grazing areas, providing easy prey for hungry wild predators.
Emphasising the dangers of habituation, Zakaria said Deosai marmots were routinely being fed by visitors. “You never, never, feed wild animals; that’s the cardinal rule!”
The HWF had originally advised that no permanent roads or permanent structures be built inside the park, to avoid the kind of irreversible environmental damage seen in Naran, Kaghan and more recently in Nathia Gali.
“But now with traffic hundred times higher, we may need hard top roads to reduce dust, noise and vehicles getting stuck in snow and for them not to go astray and remain in the designated area.
He also stressed the need for better campsite management, garbage disposal and upgraded restaurants, adding that education will have a key role to play in any betterment.

Javed was
arrested
by the agency in the case about fake videos of Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari being uploaded on social media, her lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq said on Wednesday.
The activist was presented before a district court in Lahore today before Judicial Magistrate Naeem Wattoo, with the NCCIA requesting 30 days of physical remand.
The remand order — a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
— states that Ashfaq argued that there was no material on record to justify Javed’s arrest.
“There are illegalities in [the] procedure of warrant and proclamation,” the order read, quoting Ashfaq. “There is nothing on record to show any material to support remand … there is no plausible reason for remand.
“There is [a] serious violation of Section 40 (forensic laboratory) [of] Peca, 2016,” he added “It was mandatory to establish an independent Forensic Lab, but said is not yet [established].”
The order added that the forensics lab, self-established by the Federal Investigation Agency, produces reports which have “no value in [the] eyes of [the] law”.
“IO (investigating officer) admitted that said viral clip is deleted on [the] Internet,” the order read. “After that, there is no need for remand.”
During the hearing, Ashfaq highlighted that the NCCIA is both the complainant and the investigating authority in its case.
According to the order, the NCCIA’s lawyers argued that Javed is the main suspect in this case and disseminated the videos of Bokhari.
“She did not join [the] investigation [and] arrest warrants were issued. She was not arrested,” they argued. “[A] proclamation order was also passed [and a] challan was submitted [under section] 512 (Record of evidence in absence of accused) [of the] CrPC (Criminal Code of Procedure) extent to ]the] accused.
“The accused’s mobile phone must be forensically examined,” the lawyers argued in the hearing.
The NCCIA’s lawyers added that the forensics laboratory was set up for the agency under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016 and that if it was not established separately, then that was on the part of the federal government and should have no impact on the quality of its reports.
“Deletion of [the] objectionable video does not declare [the] accused to be considered as acquitted,” it added. “Recovery is yet to be affected. It is [the] first remand … therefore, it is held that [the] contentions of IO are plausible for remand.”
The magistrate awarded five days of physical remand to Javed, noting that she could not be remanded under Section 167 of the CrPC (procedure when investigation cannot be completed in twenty-four hours).
He directed that the jail superintendent keep Javed in custody until September 30, when she is to be produced at the next hearing and sought a report on the investigation from the NCCIA by then.
Bokhari had sought action last year in July against the persons involved in sharing her
edited images
on social media. She alleged that Falak edited and spread her images on social media. The minister said a request was made to the FIA under Peca to take action against Falak and others, but the agency did not take any action.
The minister argued that she had been defamed on social media and that her constitutional rights had been violated. In her petition, she asked the court to order the FIA to take action against the respondents and submit a compliance report.",2025-09-25,Rana Bilal,894,0.000127
https://www.dawn.com/news/1942538/deadlock-persists-on-gb-traders-demand-for-tax-exemptions,Deadlock persists on GB traders’ demand for tax exemptions - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"GILGIT: The prime minister’s 22-member committee failed on Tuesday to reach consensus on
recommendations
for resolving grievances of Gilgit-Baltistan’s
traders
, with the matter deferred to another meeting scheduled for Wednesday.
The committee, formed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to address concerns over taxes and clearance of consignments imported from China via the Khunjerab Pass, met in Isla­mabad under the chairmanship of Fe­­deral Energy Minister Awais Leghari. It was the body’s fourth meeting.
The session was attended by federal ministers Rana Sanaullah and Amir Muqam, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan, Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, GB Assembly member Amjad Hussain Advocate, and representatives from the NLC, FBR, MI, IB, FIA and ISI.
Tax-free zone
Sources said the GB chief minister and Amjad Hussain Advocate pressed for declaring Gilgit-Baltistan a tax-free zone and allowing residents to import unlimited items from China for local consumption. Mr Khan argued that as GB was a non-tariff area, the collection of federal taxes was unjustified.
Border remains blocked as traders’ sit-in at Sost continues for 50th day
However, Senator Mandviwalla opposed the proposal for unlimited imports, while objections were also raised over the mechanism to exempt GB residents from income tax and other federal levies.
Mr Hussain told
Dawn
that committee members from GB also sought urgent clearance of consignments stuck at
Sost Dry Port
for the past 10 months, which have caused traders billions in losses.
The meeting ended in deadlock over the mechanism for imports and exemptions. Sources said the committee would reconvene in Islamabad on Wednesday (today) to try to bridge differences and present unified recommendations to the prime minister.
Earlier, the GB cabinet, after consultations with protesting traders, submitted proposals recommending that prior permission from the GB government be mandatory for imports intended for local consumption. It also called for reassessment of perishable goods stuck at Sost to allow depreciation relief under the prime minister’s amnesty scheme.
The cabinet also suggested exempting local traders from all federal taxes — including income tax, sales tax, federal excise duty and regulatory duty — on goods sold in GB markets, but imposing full duties and taxes on consignments transported outside the region.
Meanwhile, opposition members in the GB Assembly staged a walkout on Monday after their resolution on traders’ issues was not tabled despite bei­ng on the agenda. The resolution dem­anded that GB be declared a tax-free zone. Speaker Nazir Ahmed said the quorum had not been met, prompting members to stage a walkout in protest.
Sit-in enters 50th day
At Sost,
traders’ sit-in
entered its 50th consecutive day on Monday, blocking the Karakoram Highway and suspending cross-border trade with China. Immigration offices and border entry and exit points also remained closed.
The blockade has stranded hundreds, including Chinese nationals, foreign tourists and Pakistani students enrolled in Chinese universities. Although immigration was briefly opened on Thursday, it was closed again the next day.

• Urges awareness campaigns on travel rules, protocols, and safety measures; recommends $50 subsidy package on the pattern of Haj facilities
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Standing Committee on Religious Affairs on Thursday directed the ministry to prepare a comprehensive framework for facilitating millions of Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) who visit holy sites in
Iraq
and
Saudi Arabia
each year.
The meeting, chaired by Commitee’s chairperson Shagufta Jumani, was informed that Iraq has recently imposed restrictions on visas for men under 50 travelling alone.
The committee held a detailed discussion on the Zaireen policy and directed the religious ministry to continue the traditional “Salaar” mechanism for managing pilgrim groups.
The chairperson urged the ministry to launch awareness campaigns through print, electronic and social media to guide Zaireen on travel rules, protocols and safety measures. The panel also sought a subsidy package, including a $50 reduction in costs, on the pattern of Haj facilities.
On air travel, the committee recommended consultations with Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and other authorities to initiate direct flights from Karachi to Najaf.
It further proposed the establishment of permanent facilitation desks at major airports and the restoration of Pakistan Houses in Makkah and Madinah to ensure dignified accommodation for pilgrims.
The committee stressed that contracts for pilgrim services should be awarded to multiple reputed companies through a transparent process to improve competition and efficiency.
Members also expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements for the annual official delegation to Roza-i-Rasool (PBUH), urging that the delegation be treated as state guests and the standard operating procedures (SOPs) be reviewed.
A subcommittee headed by Ms Jumani was formed to draft recommendations.
The panel also took up the National Commission for Minorities Rights Bill, 2025, moved by Naveed Amir Jeeva.
While deliberating on the arrangements for the annual visit of the official high-level delegation to pay homage at Roza-i-Rasool (PBUH), the committee again expressed dissatisfaction with the current arrangements. Members emphasised the importance of ensuring the delegation’s timely departure and presence at Roza-i-Rasool on 12th Rabiul-Awwal every year, in view of the sanctity and significance of the occasion.
The committee further recommended that the delegation be accorded the status of state guests to uphold the dignity and honour of Pakistan during the sacred visit. In this regard, the committee urged the ministry to hold consultations with its counterpart authorities in the Saudi Arabia (KSA) and to pursue the matter of extending an official invitation from the Saudi government.
To strengthen the institutional framework and eliminate loopholes in the system, the committee recommended a comprehensive review of the existing SOPs related to the annual delegation visit.
For this purpose, the committee constituted a subcommittee tasked with revisiting the SOPs and submitting detailed recommendations for further consideration and appropriate action by the standing committee. The sub-committee will comprise Shagufta Jumani, Asiya Naz Tanoli, Samina Khalid Ghurki, and Syed Sami Ullah.
The meeting was attended by Pir Syed Fazal Ali Shah Jilani, Seema Mohiuddin Jameeli, Asiya Naz Tanoli, Dr. Nelson Azeem, Samina Khalid Ghurki, Ahmed Saleem Siddiqui, Mussarat Rafique Mah­esar, Muneeba Iqbal, Neelam. It was also attended by Minister of State Kesoo Mal Khael Das, as well as the secretary and senior officers from the Ministry of Reli­gious Affairs and Inter-Faith Harmony.

• Senators seek clarity on energy supply, debt before privatisation
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee was informed on Monday that Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited is expected to be
privatised
by November this year.
Briefing the Senate Standing Committee on Privatisation on the current status of the process, the Privatisation Commission secretary said that four companies were participating and would need to form consortiums with established airlines to operate PIA. Two applicants had already been disqualified for not meeting standards.
When Senator Zeeshan Khanzada raised concerns over PIA’s Rs650 billion debt, committee chairman Senator Dr Afnan Ullah Khan suggested that the airline’s two hotels could be sold to offset liabilities.
When Senator Khanzada questioned the government’s strategy of selling profitable companies in the first phase, the Privatisation Com­mis­sion secretary replied that investors are naturally more interested in profitable entities. Even if such companies were given away for free, he argued, it would still be the right decision as they may not remain profitable in the future.
The committee, chaired by Afnan Ullah Khan and attended by Senators Zeeshan Khanzada, Umer Farooq and Asad Qasim, also reviewed progress on other key
privatisation initiatives
, including power distribution companies (Discos), generation companies (Gencos), and Pakistan Minerals Development Corporation (PMDC).
The committee members stressed the need for clarity on energy supply agreements, debt restructuring and protection of profitable state assets before moving forward with privatisation.
Power Division officials informed the committee that Nandipur and Guddu power plants are on the privatisation list. “Eight important issues of Nandipur have been resolved, with only one pending related to the gas purchase and sale agreement,” they said, adding that the government was still deciding whether to provide a dedicated gas supply or continue with the current arrangement of supply on availability.
Regarding the Guddu power pla­nt, the officials said that four of nine outstanding issues had been resol­v­­ed, while disputes over land transfer re­­mained. The plant’s land is still re­­g­­istered under Wapda, though the latter has issued an NOC and the transfer process is underway.
Senator Afnan Ullah underlined the importance of resolving the energy supply issue for successful privatisation.

arrested
in connection with the alleged harassment of a social media influencer and attempt to kidnap her was given in police custody on physical remand.
The police had arrested the man, a native of Lahore but a resident of Golra, the other day after the girl got a case registered against him on Sunday alleging that he had harassed, slapped and tried to kidnap her.
On Tuesday, Shalimar police produced the accused in the court of judicial magistrate to seek his remand. After hearing the arguments the magistrate gave him in police custody on physical remand.
Earlier, the accused gave a statement to the police about his relation with the girl and what happened on the day of the incident, a police officer said, adding that he told police that they had been acquaintances since long.
He claimed that when he came over to her house, she was making a video of him with her mobile phone, which he snatched from her.
He said when she came to get back her mobile phone, he pushed her in the car and drove away. However, later he himself dropped her in front of the gate of her house.
The accused further told the police that he threw the mobile phone away and also pointed out the location where he had thrown it.
Earlier police registered a case against the accused in response to a complaint lodged by Samia Hijab, a resident of E-11 sector.
In her complaint, the victim sought immediate legal action against the accused who was personally acquainted to her. She went on to say that over time, his behaviour towards her turned into persistent harassment and intimidation and he started forcing her to go out with him against her will.
She further claimed that despite her clear discomfort and objections, he would come to her house repeatedly without her permission or consent and gave her gifts which she never accepted.
The complainant stated that on August 31, around 6:30pm, when she went out of her house to return the gifts, he humiliated her in public and slapped her several times, thereby causing her great physical and mental trauma.
Prior to this incident, he had been stalking her since morning, persistently calling her, and issuing threats. On one of the phone calls, he categorically stated that if she stepped out, he would beat her.
In view of this, she was left with no option but to call 15 and report his whereabouts when he physically assaulted her.

petition
filed by Barrister Hassaan Khan Niazi, a nephew of incarcerated PTI founding chairman Imran Khan.
Mr Niazi challenged his handover to the army and subsequent trial proceedings in connection with the May 9 riots.
The bench comprising Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi and Justice Tariq Mehmood Bajwa took up the petition as an “objection case.”  The office had objected that a certified copy of the commanding officer’s impugned order was not attached with the petition and that the petitioner had not approached the relevant forum before moving the court.
The bench directed the law officers of both governments to come up with arguments on the objections on Sept 16.
Mr Niazi was handed over to the military for trial in 2023 and was sentenced to 10-year imprisonment later in December in the Jinnah House attack case.
In his petition, the petitioner contended that after his arrest in the May 9 case, he was not produced before a civilian court and was instead handed over to the military by Sarwar Road police. He argued that this handover was illegal as it was not based on any judicial order.
The petitioner asked the court to set aside the Aug 17, 2023 notification of the commanding officer authorising his custody by the military, and declare all proceedings before the military court unlawful. He further asked the LHC to order his release or production before an anti-terrorism court.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941229/governor-kundi-condemns-punjab-govts-arbitrary-ban-on-wheat-supply-to-kp,Governor Kundi condemns Punjab govt’s ‘arbitrary ban’ on wheat supply to KP - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Thursday condemned the Punjab government’s reported ban on wheat supply to his province.
Kundi had last week
expressed his regret
over reports that wheat supply from Punjab had been suspended. However, Punjab officials tasked with maintaining supplies of commodities and regulating their prices denied there was any ban on the grain’s inter-provincial movement.
“The arbitrary ban imposed on August 31, 2025, by the Government of Punjab on the supply of wheat and flour to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a blatant violation of Article 151 of the Constitution and a serious breach of national unity,” Kundi said on X.
The Constitution’s
Article 151
states that “trade, commerce and intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be free”, but empowers the parliament to “impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one province and another or within any part of Pakistan as may be required in the public interest”.
The KP governor further noted: “As a result, the price of a 20kg bag of flour has soared to approximately Rs 1,200 in Punjab and up to Rs 2,800 in KP — an unbearable burden on families already struggling with inflation.
“On behalf of the people of KP, I strongly condemn this discriminatory act and urge Chief Minister Punjab [Maryam Nawaz] to not only condemn but also immediately withdraw this verbal ban,” he added.
Stressing that food security cannot be “compromised by provincial barriers”, Kundi also called on the PTI’s KP government to “urgently provide wheat quotas to flour mills to stabilise prices and protect the rights of our people”.
Yesterday, the KP Assembly unanimously passed a resolution, denouncing the Punjab government’s “restrictions” on wheat supply amid claims about a 68 per cent hike in flour prices across the province.
The
sharp rise in prices
is evident in branded flour, with some millers raising the cost of a five-kilogramme bag of fine flour to Rs700, up from Rs500 on August 1 and Rs600 on September 1, despite the arrival of the new wheat crop earlier this year.
The issue came to light earlier this month, when the KP chapter of All Pakistan Flour Mills Association
said
the Punjab government had imposed a ban on the interprovincial movement of wheat and called it “unconstitutional”.
Some market analysts believe the ongoing wheat crisis is unrelated to the
recent floods
in Punjab and other regions, as the new wheat crop was harvested in March/April. However,
hoarders
, stockists and investors are reportedly holding substantial wheat stocks, waiting for further price hikes driven by supply and demand dynamics.
On Tuesday, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced a
three-day grace period
for all wheat hoarders to voluntarily declare their inventory or face action.
The government has also recently
unveiled
a new roadmap for the ‘National Wheat Policy and Wheat Management Strategy’ for 2025-26 and onwards that will serve as a long-term plan to ensure food security, safeguard farmers’ livelihoods, protect consumers and build resilience against market disruptions and climate-induced emergencies.",2025-09-11,Dawn.com,784,0.000119

In a post on X following his meeting with Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) Chairman Raja Ali Raza Anwar on the sidelines of the 69th IAEA General Conference in Vienna, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi highlighted Pakistan’s achievements in expanding its civil nuclear energy capacity.
He observed that Pakistan’s nuclear power programme was advancing “at a good pace”, particularly with the ongoing construction of Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Unit-5 (C-5).
Grossi recalled witnessing the first concrete pouring at the site in February, which he described as a “major milestone in Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen energy security through clean and sustainable nuclear power”.
The IAEA DG and PAEC chairman reviewed areas of cooperation under various agency initiatives.
These included Atoms4Food, which applies nuclear technology to improve crop yields, food safety and pest control, and Rays of Hope, which aims to expand access to nuclear medicine and radiotherapy for cancer care across the Asia-Pacific region.
Grossi appreciated Pakistan’s active engagement with the agency, especially in capacity-building, training, and the application of nuclear knowledge for socio-economic development.
He noted that Pakistan continued to serve as an important partner in the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology.
The PAEC chairman reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the peaceful applications of nuclear technology, in line with national development priorities and IAEA frameworks. He underlined that Pakistan’s nuclear power plants operated under the highest safety standards and contributed significantly to the energy mix by providing reliable, low-carbon electricity.
“The PAEC’s activities were closely aligned with the IAEA’s vision of promoting nuclear technology for peace, health, and prosperity,“Anwar added.
The meeting also provided an opportunity to discuss Pakistan’s contributions to regional initiatives under the IAEA, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, where Pakistani expertise in nuclear applications is being shared with other member states.
The Pakistani delegation reiterated the country’s resolve to continue working with the IAEA and member states in advancing peaceful nuclear cooperation, sustainable development and improved quality of life for people across the region.

The 26th Constitutional Amendment, also known as the Constitutional Package, is
legislation
that takes away the SC’s suo motu powers, sets the CJP’s term at three years and empowers a special par­liamentary committee to nominate the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges.
Last month, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi had
ignored
a decision made last year by a committee, constituted under the Practice and Procedure Act 2023, to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment of the Constitution before the full SC.
After filing his petition today, Khokhar said while speaking to the media that he sought the CJP’s decision to be overturned.
“The chief justice said, ‘I have informally consulted all Supreme Court justices. We have concluded that all judges of the Supreme Court do not hear this case’”, Khokhar said.
“When one committee administratively gives its decision according to the law, you cannot ignore it,” the former senator emphasised. “In our petition, we have put forward this exact stance — that the committee’s decision stands on its own merit and CJP Afridi’s informal consultations have no legal basis.”
According to a copy of the petition available with
Dawn.com
, Khokhar pleaded that the apex court “declare that the decision of the committee constituted under Section 2 of the Practice and Procedure Act, directing fixation of the pending petitions before the Full Court is binding and shall be implemented forthwith.”
He requested that the law secretary and other authorities related to the matter be directed to immediately fix the pending petitions challenging the 26th Constitutional Amendment before the Full Court in compliance with the committee’s decision date.
Additionally, he pleaded that the apex court declare that “any administrative act or explanation negating or obstructing the implementation of the committee’s order is without lawful authority and of no legal effect”.
He lastly requested the court to pass any other order deemed “just and proper” in the circumstances of the case, in the interest of justice and to uphold the Constitution.
The petition argued that under Section 2(2) of the Practice and Procedure Act, the committee, by majority decision dated October 31, 2024, directed the registrar’s office to fix the petitions before the Full Court.
“The said direction remains lawful, valid, and binding. Neither the registrar nor any other administrative authority has the competence to disregard or override a lawful order of the committee,” it stated.
Khokhar contended that ignoring the committee’s decision was akin to administrative impropriety and damaged the apex court as an institution.
“The refusal to implement the committee’s lawful order deprives the petitioners and other stakeholders of their constitutional right to a fair hearing and timely adjudication of challenges involving the basic structure of the Constitution, thereby offending Articles 4, 10A, and 25 of the Constitution,” the petition added.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943439/pakistan-will-have-to-adapt-to-floods-as-the-new-normal-says-expert,"Pakistan will have to adapt to floods as the new normal, says expert - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","With millions displaced and close to
a thousand
people dead, the Pakistan floods that have been ongoing since June are worryingly reminiscent of the floods that
devastated the country
in 2022.
As the country fights to keep its head above the rising floodwaters, many questions abound. Could the damage so far have been contained? How has climate change contributed? Has India’s release of floodwater — which it had warned about — exacerbated the loss and damage of its lower riparian neighbour? Have the floods been down to bad governance, or a lack of preparedness?
To understand these matters,
Dialogue Earth
spoke to Muhammad Ehsan Leghari, an expert on water resource management and member for the Sindh province at the Pakistani water regulator, the Indus River System Authority. He discussed the factors that have contributed to the unprecedented floods in Pakistan, what has and hasn’t worked for flood control, and how the country can manage future floods effectively. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What are the main natural and human-made factors that cause recurrent floods along the Indus River and its tributaries, particularly the massive inflows in the Punjab rivers?
As the geographer Gilbert F. White
noted
in 1942, “Floods are ‘acts of God’, but flood losses are largely acts of man”. Human choices in building and managing floodplains can turn natural hazards into disasters. The world, including Pakistan, has been slow to adopt behavioural adjustments alongside engineering, often implementing solutions poorly or unnecessarily.
There are some key factors, generally, regarding the exacerbation of flood impacts. Weak governance turns emergencies into disasters, as seen in recent deaths from floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other parts of Pakistan. Lack of rational spatial or land-use planning exacerbates urban and riverine flooding. Top-down planning ignores real issues and experiences for most Pakistanis. Political and bureaucratic elites prioritise “brick-and-mortar” development that increases flood and hazard impacts.
Intense monsoons with 200 to 300mm rainfall that had been
forecasted
, glacial melt and storms, predicted amid northern heatwaves, are natural factors that caused the floods. But human-made factors cannot be ignored: deforestation increases
runoff
, and urbanisation and encroachments
block natural flows
. Similarly, the
Ravi Urban Development Authority
’s paving of floodplains along the Ravi River in Punjab turned absorbent areas into concrete, inviting devastation by turning them into river paths.
Reports like Pakistan’s
2025 Monsoon Prediction
, the
National Adaptation Plan
and the updated
Climate Change Policy
highlight reduced river capacity from bridges and encroachments. They’ve urged resilience through wetlands and habitat restoration, but have been ignored.
The 2025 inflows have been
a result of
exceptional upstream rains, Himalayan melt, and India’s
dam releases
amid heavy rainfall that overwhelmed Punjab’s flatlands, displacing over
2m
people and impacting more
3.6m
, with millions more at risk as waters reach Sindh. This exposes systemic issues: encroached plains displace water onto communities, costing billions. Enforced zoning is needed to break the cycle.
How do glacial melt and changing monsoon patterns contribute to flooding in Pakistan?
They drive unpredictability.
Accelerated melting
in the Himalayan, Hindu Kush and Karakoram mountain ranges due to warming heightens during heatwaves, synchronising with erratic, concentrated rains that overload the Chenab and Sutlej rivers in Punjab. The province faces riverine overflows, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh see flash and urban floods.
With Pakistan contributing to
less than one per cent
of global emissions, it’s an unjust hit when the country suffers from climate extremes, and in turn,
$2 billion
in losses. Pakistan will have to adapt to this new normal via basin monitoring, integrating it into development paradigms.
How effective are barrages, embankments and canals in managing floods? Do they worsen downstream flooding?
Controlled systems often increase downstream floods and droughts. Punjab mostly managed its headworks (structures at waterway diversion points) and barrages well during 2025 peaks, ensuring safely passing overflows. But
Head Panjnad
, a barrage where five rivers converge, faced aggressive flood waves, as forecasts by the
Flood Forecasting Division
had forewarned us. Punjab has rehabilitated most of its barrages; Sindh is upgrading its
Guddu and Sukkur
barrages.
However, these hydraulic structures can cause bottlenecks, blocking river paths and causing breaches, shifting burdens without adequate warning. Our infrastructure is old and inadequate, fostering a false sense of security for nearby developments. The solution is to shift strategy: live with floods, remove bottlenecks, let rivers flow and nourish floodplains. In addition, we must combine
nature-based solutions
— such as restoring floodplains — and controlling overflows with modern technology like automated barrage gates and
AI forecasting
.
What role does silt and sediment buildup in rivers and barrages play in increasing flood risks?
It raises riverbeds. Sediment buildup has elevated the River Indus riverbed, reducing the river’s flood handling capacity by 17.75pc.
Research
has shown that over a 24-year period, this issue, combined with diminished water flow, has decreased the river’s capacity to manage high water levels by nearly half. Without management, sediment buildup causes spills, erosion, breaches and waterlogging.
It’s a cyclical issue: earlier deforestation upstream caused more soil to wash into the river, and the continued failure to manage this sediment has made recent floods, such as those in 2025, much worse, costing billions and impacting thousands of people. We need basin-wide sediment strategies such as
integrated watershed management
for the Indus, involving India and Afghanistan.
How is climate change expected to alter the intensity and frequency of floods in the Indus River basin over the next 20–30 years?
Climate change will increase the intensity and frequency of floods in the basin over the next few decades. This will mainly be caused by more intense monsoon rains, surging glacier melt and rising sea levels that block drainage in Sindh. It will lead to a new normal of more severe flooding, such as that seen in the
2010
, 2022 and 2025 events. That means increased losses and vulnerability, with models predicting even more economic and human damage.
Research
from the World Weather Attribution supports the overall trend of rising flood vulnerability.
To counter this, a combination of nature-based solutions like restoring wetlands to help absorb floodwaters and engineering solutions are needed, along with improved governance across the entire river basin.
Which groups or regions in Punjab have been most vulnerable to floods, and what local strategies could reduce their risk?
In my opinion, with around
4m people
affected, the low-lying districts along the Sutlej, Chenab, Ravi and Indus rivers, especially Multan, Jhang, Layyah, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Bahawalnagar, have borne the brunt of recent floods. Urban risk zones include cities like Sialkot, Rawalpindi, Chakwal and
Lahore
; they face serious flood threats due to drainage and planning challenges.
If we seriously want to safeguard these regions, several measures will have to be taken, such as rebuilding and maintaining concrete embankments, in addition to offering seasonal relocation incentives for local people, deploying mobile and veterinary health units, and mobilising elder-led evacuation plans that draw on ancestral knowledge. Also, empowering communities through bridging skills gaps [in disaster preparedness] can
lower risks
drastically.
Are flood warning systems in Pakistan good enough, and if not, how can they be improved?
While flood warning systems have gotten better since 2010, they still need improvement. There is a definite lack of preparedness. Currently, one of the main problems is poor communication. Warnings don’t always reach rural areas, and sometimes they aren’t broadcast in local languages or communication channels. We also have accuracy issues: the information is not always reliable or delivered in real time. This is occasionally made worse by a lack of shared data between countries, as seen in the 2025 events involving India, particularly the
suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty
in April.
To improve these systems, we need to take steps such as using 24/7 monitoring and expanding communication through community radio and text message alerts, and ensure better coordination between all groups involved, especially at the community level. Most importantly, we need to shift from a top-down, reactive approach, to a bottom-up, community-driven one that empowers local people, especially the most vulnerable.
Did India release water that caused Punjab’s floods, and if so, was Pakistan warned?
India released excess dam water — including from the Bhakra dam upstream of Pakistan’s Punjab province — worsening monsoon surges. Under the
Indus Water Treaty
, India should have restored effective communications mechanisms. Pakistan implies that India may have
used water as a weapon
; however,
warnings
came earlier through diplomatic channels — the first since the Indus Waters Treaty suspension — on humanitarian grounds.
What should Pakistan prioritise in order to mitigate floods?
Pakistan should prioritise rainwater harvesting, urban water reuse, developing green building codes, restoring its wetlands and floodplains, watershed management and forestation, which together can cut flood peaks by
10-20pc
. A
2023 Dutch white paper
also stresses integrated resilience through three methods: water “reuse” (spreading so as to recharge groundwater) and “retention/reduction” (via cross-drainage and flood channels), as well as the concept of “removing”, or making space for the river through bridge redesign and bund removals, rather than resort to mega-dam projects.
Dams are not the solution. They bring high costs, ecological damage, displacement, and can even worsen floods. We saw this in 2025, when water was released from India’s
full dams on the Ravi and Sutlej
rivers into encroached plains, and the part of the Chenab river without dams surged to
1m cusecs
(cubic flow per second). Dams are widely seen as anti-poor, anti-environment and
unjust
.
Which province has suffered the most in the floods of 2025?
Nationwide, since late-June, there have been over 900 monsoon-related deaths, and as of September 11, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has had the most fatalities (
504
) from flash floods, landslides and cloudbursts. From August 14 to 16, cloudbursts triggered
flash floods
in the province. Buner, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was worst hit, with at least
380 deaths
.
Shangla
,
Swat
and Swabi, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saw similar destruction. Intense rain, deforestation, valley blockages and unregulated construction turned debris deadly, showing an urgent need for mountain-area planning and regulation.
Punjab faces the biggest infrastructure and agricultural losses. Sindh has suffered the longest inundation and displacement due to its flat [and poorly draining] terrain. The terrain drives impacts; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s slopes are deadly, while Punjab and Sindh bear economic and geographically spread-out damage [due to being relatively flat]. The whole country is in need of multidimensional recovery.
What are the risks to Sindh, as the lower riparian province?
Sindh’s lower riparian status exposes it to unmanaged upstream floods. But despite that, it lacks input on
water releases
or land use. In the province, rains amplify to become disasters due to its flat terrain with no flood escape routes, forcing river flows to reclaim floodplains through devastating breaches and prolonged inundation.
What are the biggest governance or policy gaps preventing effective flood management in Pakistan?
The main obstacle is weak governance. More than 400 flood path obstructions were identified in 2011 in a government report I worked on, which mapped over 350 coordinates. Flood responses are often fragmented and reactive, while agencies like the National Disaster Management Authority (
NDMA
) and its provincial counterparts remain disconnected from communities.
Irrigation departments are under-resourced and politicised, and the 10-year
Flood Plan IV
has stalled. Spatial planning rules are poorly enforced, and elite development projects by the
Ravi Urban Development Authority
tend to overshadow
public safety
. Mandates remain unclear, with overlapping institutions and unresolved inter-provincial disputes. To move forward, Pakistan needs clearly defined roles — who is responsible, when, how and at what cost.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942746/protesting-kp-employees-want-ban-on-entry-of-armed-men-to-secretariat,Protesting KP employees want ban on entry of armed men to secretariat - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"PESHAWAR: The employees of Civil Secretariat here on Wednesday demanded of authorities to ban entry of armed men in the secretariat as they continued their protest for third consecutive day against an aide of the chief minister for ‘storming’ the office of education secretary.
They have been protesting since Monday against the special assistant to chief minister on relief and rehabilitation, Naik Mohammad, for allegedly
storming
the office of secretary of elementary and secondary education department along with armed men.
The protest has brought the entire government machinery at Civil Secretariat along with attached departments and directorates across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to a standstill.
The demand was made through a resolution that was passed at an emergency meeting of Provincial Management Service (PMC) Association and Secretariat Coordination Council convened to hold deliberations over the situation after the storming of the office of the secretary of elementary and secondary education.
Demand registration of FIR against CM aide for ‘storming’ office of education secretary
“Police deployed at all the gates of Civil Secretariat should do body search of all government servants and other visitors. Arms or other prohibited items should be submitted with police,” said the resolution approved by the employees amid their protest. The employees also demanded of government to keep a record of all people visiting Civil Secretariat for security reasons.
The government servants also demanded ban on the entry of private vehicles to the civil secretariat, saying the employees having their private vehicles should be issued gate passes.
Through the resolution, the protesting government employees also demanded registration of a First Information Report (FIR) against Naik Mohammad.
It is pertinent to mention here that that the incident involving special assistant to chief minister took place last Friday when he allegedly barged into the office of Education Secretary Mohammad Khalid in Civil Secretariat along with armed guards and other persons to push him into withdrawing transfer orders of North Waziristan’s district education officer (female).
An education department’s ‘situation report’ shared with senior government functionaries said that at around 4:30pm on Sept 12, the special assistant to chief minister on relief, Naik Mohammad, accompanied by his armed guards and 10 to 15 private individuals, forcibly entered the office of the education secretary.
An office-bearer of PMS Association told
Dawn
that they submitted the resolution regarding registration of an FIR with the chief secretary, and the other related to banning entry of armed men into the secretariat with the administration secretary for immediate action. The chairman of PMS Association, Numan Wazir, told
Dawn
that their protest would continue till the fulfillment of their demands.
He said that banning entry of gunmen into secretariat was need of the hour as such people risked the lives of civil servants.
A senior bureaucrat told
Dawn
that the chief secretary had also taken serious notice of the attack on the education secretary and protest by employees. “The chief secretary will soon convene a meeting of secretaries’ committee to deliberate on this issue and frame rules to prevent such incidents in future,” he added.
Also, the attached formations of education department including provincial directorate and district education offices wore a deserted look owing to the absence of employees.
The government employees at the offices of divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners and other attach departments also wore black armbands as protest.
On Wednesday, the employees continued their sit-in outside the office of education secretary.
The sit-in started at 10am and concluded at 2pm. The senior and junior bureaucrats delivered their speeches, demanding of the government to provide security to them.
Addressing the sit-in, Education Secretary Mohammad Khalid said that their protest was for the restoration of sanctity of the secretariat. “Everyone visiting government departments at Civil Secretariat is respectable for us, but we will not let anybody disrespect any government servant,” he said.
He demanded of chief minister to de-seat the special assistant on relief.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1938981/drive-to-vaccinate-89m-children-against-polio-across-sindh-begins,Drive to vaccinate 8.9m children against polio across Sindh begins - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: Inaugurating a week-long anti-polio campaign to vaccinate 8.9 million children across Sindh, Federal Health Minister Mustafa Kamal shared serious concern over the growing number of polio cases in the country and regretted that the city of Karachi has a high vaccination
refusal rate.
Speaking at a programme at a private school on Monday, he said: “Twenty-seven thousand people in Karachi have refused polio vaccination for their children. In the Gujjo area alone, 1,327 households have declined to let their children have protection against the crippling disease.”
Highlighting the challenges in the fight against polio, the minister referred to Afghanistan, one of the two last countries alongside Pakistan where polio is still endemic, currently seeing an immunization drive.
“Right now, a door-to-door polio vaccination drive is in progress across Afghanistan except Kandahar, where children are being immunised at community mosques,” he told the gathering.
Kamal regrets 27,000 parents have refused polio vaccine for their children in Karachi
He urged parents not to miss the opportunity and come forward as there was a treatment for even cancer but not for polio. “Once a child falls victim to polio, he is paralysed for the rest of his life.”
According to officials, the campaign targets 8.9 million children under the age of five across 25 high-risk districts of the province. Running from Sept 1 to 7, the campaign will see the deployment of over 70,000 trained frontline workers in a door-to-door effort to ensure that every eligible child receives the life-saving oral polio vaccine.
In her message, Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho said, “We have come a long way, but the virus still threatens our children — especially in underserved and mobile communities. I urge all parents to cooperate with vaccinators and ensure their children receive the polio drops.”
The campaign covers 1,041 union councils, with special focus on riverine and Katcha areas, as well as underserved urban settlements. More than 20,000 law enforcement personnel have been deployed to support safe and secure operations across the province.
The campaign is supported by the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, World Health Organisation, Rotary International, the Gates Foundation, Gavi and the CDC, as part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
The government has appealed to all segments of society — including parents, religious leaders, teachers, students, journalists and civil society organisations — to support this crucial campaign by spreading awareness, countering misinformation, and helping ensure that no child is left unvaccinated.

Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence
agreement
, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in
Riyadh
on Wednesday.
Talking more about the deal in an interview on
Geo News
show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ and whether more Arab nations could become part of it, Asif said: “I cannot prematurely answer this, but I will definitely say the doors are not closed.”
Asif said he had always called for a similar arrangement like Nato since there was greater vulnerability for Pakistan, pointing to the history of the region in the last 40-50 years.
“I think it is a fundamental right of the countries and people here, particularly the Muslim population, to together defend their region, countries and nations.”
He said there was no clause in the agreement that ruled out the entry of any other nation or that Pakistan could not sign a similar agreement with anyone else.
Asked about whether Pakistan’s nuclear assets were also up for use under the agreement, Asif said: “What we have, our capabilities, will absolutely be available under this pact. But let me say, since Pakistan has become a nuclear state, never has anyone challenged our status of being a
responsible nuclear power
.”
Asif said Pakistan had always offered its nuclear facilities for inspection and never committed any violation. He added that this is in contrast to Israel, which had not allowed any inspection.
Questioned about whether any attack on one country would lead to the involvement of the other and vice versa, the minister said: “Yes, absolutely. There is no doubt in this.”
He said neither Pakistan nor Saudi Arabia had named or conditioned the implementation of the defence deal with any specific country. “It is an umbrella that has been provided by both sides, that, if there is aggression against any side from any side, it will be jointly defended against and responded to.”
Asif clarified it was not an “aggressive pact” but a defensive arrangement, similar to that of Nato.
He added that Pakistan had also been involved in
training
Saudi forces for quite a while and the recent development was only a formalised “extension” of all that, adding that it was a positive thing.
“If there is aggression, whether against Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, we will jointly defend against it.”
He said Pakistan had always had talks on the issue with Saudi Arabia, saying the former had always had a large military and air force contingent present in the latter for many decades.
“I think that [pre-existing] relationship has been more defined now and that understanding has been given the form of a defence agreement. This is embedded in the history of our military cooperation and our brotherly relationship with Saudi Arabia.”
Asif also said the protection of the holy Islamic sites in Saudi Arabia was also a matter of a “sacred duty” for Pakistan.
Questioned about whether the United States was taken into confidence on the matter, Asif said he felt there was no ground or justification for any other third party to be involved in the development.
“This agreement will not be a hegemonic arrangement but a defensive arrangement … we don’t have any plans to conquer territory or attack anyone. But our fundamental right can’t be denied to us and we exercised that yesterday.”
He reiterated that Pakistan could also pursue similar arrangements with other countries.
‘Afghanistan is a hostile country’
To a question about terrorist attacks on security forces, Asif
reiterated
that
Afghan soil
is being used to stage acts of terrorism in Pakistan.
“We were swept into two wars in Afghanistan. The US, on both occasions, left the region and we are still dealing with the consequences, be it the Taliban, the TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan), the BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) or anyone else,” Asif said, referring to the Soviet-Afghan War of the 1980s and the US-led International Security Assistance Force mission after 2001.
“People embrace martyrdom daily; this liability emerged due to those two wars,” he added. “The Kabul government is not innocent in this, I am being categorical. Through these people, we are being blackmailed by them.
“I say with no ambiguity: Afghanistan is a hostile country.”
The defence minister added that Afghanistan was the last country to recognise Pakistan and that discussions on terrorism went nowhere.
When asked if Arab states would act in response to Afghan aggression, Asif encouraged it.
“I would not be against it, but how many times have we been there? They are involved in our politics as well, with a party I will not name,” he stated. “This party advocates for these people who have our children’s blood on their hands.
“This is a subject Pakistan should be clear on, and we are very clear.”
Defence deal
According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”.
“[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details.
Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an
Arab summit
that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries.
The agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades. Cooperation between the two states dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979
Grand Mosque seizure
, when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram.
In 1982, the two sides
institutionalised
security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms.
In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In February, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges.
The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella, though finer details of the agreement were not made public.
For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider.
For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting the Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time.
Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded. Islamabad’s partnerships with
China
,
Turkiye
and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses.
Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represented Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.",2025-09-18,Dawn.com,2023,0.000212

face off
for the first time in cricket since their military conflict in May.
Along with regional bragging rights, the T20 competition will serve as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka. The eight-team event in the United Arab Emirates begins when Afghanistan play minnows Hong Kong in Abu Dhabi.
Arch-rivals India and Pakistan clash in Dubai on September 14, with Pakistan bowling great Wasim Akram saying players and fans from both teams should “remain disciplined and not cross the line”.
The neighbours have not met on either side’s soil in a bilateral series since 2012 and only play each other in international tournaments on neutral ground as part of a compromise deal.
The two Asian cricketing giants have been clubbed together in the same group and could potentially meet three times in the tournament, which concludes on September 28.
There have been tensions in the build-up after Pakistan and India fought an intense
four-day conflict
in May — their worst since 1999 — when the two countries stepped back from an all-out war in the aftermath of the
April 22 attack
in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
India
blamed
Pakistan for the attack without evidence, while Islamabad strongly
denied
the allegations. New Delhi launched deadly
air strikes
on Pakistan on May 7, in response to which the Pakistan Air Force
downed
six
Indian jets. After tit-for-tat
strikes
on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a
ceasefire
.
In a sign of lingering bitterness, an Indian team of retired players
withdrew
from their semi-final with Pakistan in the World Championship of Legends in July-August in England.
Led by former international Yuvraj Singh, the Indians also refused to play Pakistan in the group stage of the tournament, as clamour grew among fans to boycott the games.
Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh was part of the veterans team and has strongly opposed the Asia Cup game.
“Blood and sweat cannot co-exist,” Harbhajan told
The Times of India
. “It cannot be the case that there’s fighting on the border, tensions between the two nations, and we go to play cricket.
“Until these big issues are resolved, cricket is a very small matter.”
India strong favourites
India and Pakistan last met in cricket, again in Dubai, in February in the 50-over
Champions Trophy
, with
India winning
by six wickets and going on to lift the title.
They are also defending Asia Cup champions and led by Suryakumar Yadav are clear favourites against their old foes with a 10-3 win record against Pakistan in T20 internationals.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944677/poverty-trap,Poverty trap - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE new World Bank report,
Reclaiming Momentum Towards Prosperity,
is a sobering reminder that Pakistan’s current growth and development model is no longer fit to sustain reduction in poverty and inequality.
The model, which supported initial gains in poverty alleviation before running aground, has already eroded two decades of progress as poverty trends reversed over the past three years. A new development trajectory is needed, one which prioritises inclusive growth, equity and sustained investment in human capital, the WB said.
The bank also called for the overhaul of the present development model at the report’s launch in Islamabad recently. “Reforms that expand access to quality services, protect households from shocks and create better jobs — especially for the bottom 40pc — are essential to break cycles of poverty and deliver durable, inclusive growth,” it said.
Poverty, which had declined from 64.3pc in 2001-02 to 21.9pc in 2018-19, has been climbing again.
It rose to 24.7pc in 2019-20, dipped briefly to 18.3pc in 2021-22, and then surged to 25.3pc in 2023-24 — a seven percentage point increase in just two years. If confirmed by the Household Integrated Economic Survey 2023-24, currently underway, it would represent a significant reversal.
The WB rightly identifies multiple shocks — Covid-19, inflation, floods, political instability, and macroeconomic stress, resulting in low and volatile growth — as important triggers. But it is equally clear that the deeper problem lies in a consumption-driven growth model, which has failed to deliver resilience, jobs or equitable progress. That “progress in poverty reduction is threatened by structural vulnerabilities” is a warning about the fragility of a system relying too heavily on unsustainable growth patterns.
The report acknowledges that Pakistan’s social protection programmes have shielded many families from destitution. But, as it makes clear, this cannot replace transformative reforms to remedy structural imbalances, improve service delivery and build resilience for long-term gains.
As rightly pointed out, education and health spending have hardly closed inequality gaps. Overreliance on indirect taxation continues to depress household incomes, hitting the poor the hardest while sparing the elites.
Structural imbalances — from elite capture and regressive fiscal policies to weak public service delivery and labour market constraints — will keep most Pakistanis trapped in poverty. Abysmal human development indicators make the picture even bleaker. Nearly 40pc of children are stunted. One in four primary school-age children is out of school, and three out of four who attend cannot write or read after five years of education.
Half the population lack safe drinking water; nearly a third lack safe sanitation. Over 85pc of jobs are informal, offering little security or upward mobility. Women and youth remain largely excluded from the workforce. How can a country expect to build a prosperous future on such shaky foundations?

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941311/twin-cities-nanbais-up-in-arms-over-wheat-flour-price,Twin Cities Nanbais up in arms over wheat flour price - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: Nanbais of the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad are up in arms, urging the government to either provide them wheat flour on subsidised rates or allow them to increase prices of Naan and Roti.
The Nanbai Associations of Rawalpindi on Thursday threatened to go on strike, if wheat flour rates were not brought under control within 10 days, while the Nanbai Association of Islamabad announced its plan to approach the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the alleged indifferent attitude of the capital administration in this regard.
Addressing a news conference at the National Press Club, Rawalpindi Nanbai Association President Shahjahan Abbasi warned the federal and provincial governments of a countrywide shutter-down, if action was not taken against flour mills and dealers amid a sharp increase in wheat flour prices.
“The government’s responsibility is to supply flour so that Roti can be sold at controlled price,” he remarked, adding that the rate of Roti should be Rs25 under the current conditions.
Ask govt to allow increase in prices of Roti, Naan or ensure provision of flour on subsidised rates
“If we are continuously harassed, we will be left with no option but to go for a nationwide strike,” he said, adding that the official price of Roti could not be maintained after a 70 per cent rise in flour rates during the past two weeks. During his presser, he used the term “mafias” for the flour mills.
He said an 80kg sack of wheat flour, which was previously available at Rs6,000, was now being sold for Rs9,000.
“How can we maintain the prices?” he asked. Mr Abbasi alleged that the “mill mafia and dealers” were profiteering in the name of floods.
He also asked the government to stop the relevant agencies and magistrates from harassing the tandoor owners through fines and crackdowns on daily basis.
Under the current arrangement in Rawalpindi, Roti (pateer) is a regulated product sold by nanbais at Rs15 for 120gm, while naan rates are set by the association at Rs25 for 120gm.
However, both are regulated products in Islamabad and their rates are notified by the ICT administration. In most parts of the capital, Nanbais are selling Roti for Rs18 and Naan for Rs20.
Talking to
Dawn
, Patron-in-Chief of the Capital Nanbai Association Habib Khan said the key demand of the tandoor owners of Islamabad was delinking Naan from the list of regulated items. He said they had decided to take the matter to the court as negotiations with the ICT administration had failed.
When contacted, Deputy Commissioner Islamabad Irfan Nawaz said the Nanbais were free to exercise their right. He said the recent rate of Roti notified by Punjab was Rs14. On the other hand, he said, they had fixed Roti price at Rs18 for Islamabad’s urban areas and Rs16 for rural areas.
“Even then they don’t follow the notified rates,” he regretted.
Anjuman Tajiran Pakistan has also supported the demands of Nanbais and asked the authorities to extend checks on flour mills and control hoarding of wheat flour and other wheat products in the country.
President of Anjuman Tajiran Kashif Chaudhry warned that the traders would announce a future course of action, if the crisis was not addressed within 10 days.
“We do not want to deprive a common man of Roti, but it is impossible to sell it at the official rate,” he said, adding that the option of strike would be considered, if the government failed to act.

“Municipal services staff are present at selected locations with machinery,” Wahab was quoted as having said in a press statement.
Rapid response teams have also been deployed to deal with any emergency situation, he added.
“Along with this, city wardens and anti-encroachment staff will also be present on the roads for the relief of citizens,” the Karachi mayor said.
The staff should be in constant contact with the officers; strict action will be taken in case of negligence, according to Wahab.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940819/six-years-on-woman-still-missing-amid-claims-of-kidnap-by-djinn,"Six years on, woman still missing amid claims of kidnap by djinn - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","LAHORE: In what appears to be a unique criminal case, a special investigation team of the Lahore police is desperately trying to resolve the six-year-old kidnap case of a woman who is believed to be abducted by a djinn (a supernatural being).
Headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, the team was formed on the directions of the Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to take up the task of recovering the missing woman, Fouzia Bibi, and submit a report to the court on Sept 18.
The complainant, Hameedan Bibi, the mother of the woman, had claimed that her daughter had suddenly gone missing in May 2019.
She said Fouzia’s in-laws claimed that she had been ‘kidnapped/taken away’ by a djinn, leaving the police groping in the dark since the launch of the FIR.
Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza told
Dawn
the chief justice took ‘strict notice’ of the incident when the police high-ups informed that the woman could not be recovered despite all possible efforts.
LHC summons CCPO on 18th
In the last hearing on Sept 2, he said, the CJ had directed Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Bilal Siddique Kamyana to appear in person along with the missing woman on Sept 18.
The DIG declared it a tough case saying that several ‘strange’ factors associated with this ‘kidnap’ case had baffled the police since the registration of the FIR.
The most irrigating part of the case for investigators was that the in-laws of the woman had kept on insisting that Fouzia was taken away by the djinn.
He said the case had been investigated under the supervision of the two chiefs of the then Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Lahore — Capt Liaqat Ali Malik and Asim Iftikhar — but they failed to trace the woman.
He said police also opted for geofencing, a technique that is increasingly used in some challenging cases, to trace the individuals’ movements and activities within a specific time frame but to no avail.
Mr Zeeshan said they also obtained the call details records (CDRs) of over 800 mobile phone numbers in order to reach the missing woman.
“We have done polygraph test of many relevant people in this case,” the DIG said, adding that the results, however, brought no positive development.
To a question, the police officer said the case may be associated with her ‘mismatched marriage’ as she was 35 years old while her husband was in his teens.
She might have been forced to marry the young man against her will and this marriage might be the leading factor behind the ‘incident of kidnap’, he said.
The DIG said police officers questioned many members of both families, including her husband, mother-in-law and other relatives.
Some of the family members claimed that the missing woman was unwilling to bear children and used to visit ‘Hakeems.’ Reportedly, she also opted for abortion. Despite this, she later gave birth to a son.
To another question, he said: “It seems the woman had deliberately gone somewhere as she was unhappy with her marriage.”
He said the woman had no CNIC, a key point that rendered the police investigators helpless in tracing her.
“The woman did not have any record in Nadra database,” he said.
The police investigators also took help from the Punjab Safe City Authority and privately installed cameras besides contacting several local residents.

Mines and Minerals Act
,  which was passed by the house two months ago.
The resolution was adopted after an understanding between the treasury and opposition benches, with legislators expressing their concern over several provisions of the act.
The chief minister, however, said in a statement that the government had accepted a request by the opposition to suspend implementation of the Act.
The joint resolution was moved by MPA Asghar Ali Tareen.
The resolution urged the provincial government to reassess the Mines and Minerals Act in view of “objections and concerns” expressed by members of different political parties.
Asghar Tareen, the mover, recalled that although it was the first time the provincial assembly had passed its own Mines and Minerals Act, its provisions had raised reservations.
“By reviewing the act, the government could remove ambiguities and ensure broader acceptance,” Mr Tareen said.
National Party President Dr Abdul Malik Baloch stressed that the Balochistan government had always enjoyed control over mines and minerals, saying that “it must remain so”.
He said under the previous law, projects had been placed under federal jurisdiction to “undermine provincial authority”.
Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said that when the Mines and Minerals Bill was introduced, the government had taken opposition lawmakers into confidence and then referred the matter to a committee for review.
“Mistakes in understanding or interpretation are possible, but some elements have unfortunately tried to politicise the matter,” the chief minister observed.
He said the government had again invited the opposition, including parties not represented in the house, to present their views and work for a consensus.
“If the opposition parties object to certain clauses, we are ready to improve them. If they find our arguments convincing, it will be a victory for the democratic process.”
New district
The house adopted another joint resolution, moved by PPP MPA Meena Majeed Baloch, calling upon the provincial government to divide Kech district and carve out a new one comprising Tump sub-division and Mand Tehsil as Kech district’s headquarter is far away from these two areas.
Meanwhile, Shahida Rauf criticised the provincial government for bulldozing draft bills through the legislature instead of referring them to a standing committee. She raised her  objection after Mir Zahoor Buledi introduced a draft bill for the Prince Fahd Hospital, Dalbandin.
The chief minister accepted her objection, reiterating that all draft bills must be referred to a standing committee.
The chair then referred the bill to the committee concerned.

• Achakzai says provinces, local populations must get first right over resources
QUETTA: Six opposition political parties announced a complete wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across Balochistan on September 8 to protest against the
suicide bombing
that targeted a BNP-Mengal pu­­blic meeting at Shahwani Stadium two days ago.
Fifteen people
lost their lives, while 38 were injured in the blast that targeted a rally held to mark the fourth death anniversary of former Balochistan chief minister Sardar Attaullah Mengal, a veteran nationalist leader and founder of the Balochistan National Party (BNP).
The strike was announced at a joint press conference on Thursday by Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Par­ty (PkMAP) Chairman Meh­mood Khan Achakzai, BNP-M Chief Sar­dar Akhtar Mengal, along with lea­ders of ANP, National Party, PTI, and Majlis Wahdat-ul-Muslimeen.
They noted that senior leaders, including Mehmood Khan Achak­zai and Sardar Akhtar Mengal, had miraculously remained safe.
They warned that such acts were an alarm bell for all political forces struggling for the rights of the people and their resources.
Mr Achakzai said that for the last two days he had been unable to understand the purpose of the attack.
If the objective was to eliminate the entire provincial leadership, what benefit would that bring to Pakistan, he wondered.
He said although the Constitution had repeatedly been violated and trampled, yet no one had ever been punished.
‘‘We will continue our democratic and political struggle for its supremacy openly and boldly. We are no one’s slaves; here there are neither masters nor servants,’’ he said.
Mr Achakzai added the first right over resources belongs to provinces and their local populations, and their share must be clearly defined.
He said finding those responsible for the attack was the duty of the state since intelligence agencies claim to be the best in the world. “If they fail to find the culprits, then the state and its institutions will be held accountable for our killings. This is our will to our people,” he declared.
Announcing the protest for September 8, Mr Achakzai said: “If we had wished to exploit public emotions that night, our workers could have set fire to all police stations and government offices in the province. Instead, we chose a peaceful, serious, and effective political response. On September 8, trains, airports, wheels, and shutters will all come to a standstill.”
The PkMAP chairman invited all political parties, including PPP and PML-N, to join the struggle and “speak with the generals” by demanding that the country be run according to the Constitution, law, and democratic principles. He said only in such a system could Pakistan become an Asian Tiger within 10 years.
Sardar Akhtar Mengal said that had the perpetrators of the March 29 incident been brought to justice, the blood of innocents would not have been spilt on September 2.
He accused the state of employing every tactic against political workers while failing to trace terrorists. He alleged that elements both within and outside official institutions may be contributing to terrorism, adding that the rulers had learned nothing from the killing of Nawab Bugti and were now targeting them as well.

According to Form-56 of the election results, the government candidate Sanaullah won after getting 250 votes.
The polling was held at the Punjab Assembly. Out of 363 members of the provincial legislature, 251 cast their ballots and one vote was rejected.
Sanaullah and the opposition’s Salma Ejaz, wife of disqualified candidate Ejaz Chaudhry, were in the fray.
However, the opposition PTI had
boycotted
the by-election for the seat that fell vacant due to the disqualification of party senator Chaudhry.
The government alliance had a majority of 263 voters, while the opposition had the support of 100 voters. The polling process in the Punjab Assembly continued uninterrupted from 9am to 4pm.
Addressing the media after his victory, Sanaullah said, “The PTI did not choose to boycott the democratic process but chose to escape from the elections.
Their boycott of the elections is a lack of confidence in their members.“
He also condemned the attack on Aleema Khan during his interaction with the media.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari were also present in the assembly to vote for Sanaullah.
Earlier in the month, according to PTI’s media wing, the annou­ncement to boycott the by-election was made by the expected candidate Salma Ejaz herself. She made it clear that she will not contest the by-election as she does not want to become part of the ‘fraudulent elections’.
Twelve PTI lawmakers in Punjab had been
disqualified
by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) following their conviction in the May 9, 2023 cases. The disqualified lawmakers comprise eight National Assembly and four Punjab Assembly legislators. The NA-129, Lahore, fell vacant on the death of MNA and former governor Mian Azhar.
PTI patron-in-chief Imran Khan has barred his party from contesting the by-polls except on NA-129 where Azhar’s son Hammad Azhar is likely to be the party’s candidate.
“We will not field any candidates in the by-elections for the seats of our unjustly disqualified members. These individuals stood firm with PTI despite extreme challenges. Therefore, the party will completely boycott these by-elections,” Mr Khan had said in a recent tweet.
Azma Bokhari claimed the PTI had already fled the by-election arena. “The PTI is unable to find candidates willing to face PML-N in the field,” she added.",2025-09-09,Adnan Sheikh,627,0.000107

Addressing a press conference at his office, Mr Odho described the arrested individuals as members of an “organised and coordinated” inter-provincial gang of car lifters.
He said the suspects had set up a workshop in Baldia Town where they tampered with stolen vehicles and sold them as non-custom paid cars, not only in Karachi but also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Among those arrested is Ayaz Jameel, a serving policeman from Madadgar-15, who allegedly facilitated the gang by helping transport the stolen vehicles to other provinces.
Mr Odho also shared that five policemen have been shot dead in Karachi so far this year. Initial investigations suggest these killings were acts of terrorism, and the Counter Terrorism Department is currently investigating the cases.
He announced that in a bid to modernise enforcement, an e-challan system for traffic violations would be introduced from October 1. The initiative aims to bridge the gap between the police and the public.
Commenting on the city’s crime situation, Mr Odho revealed that 53 people were killed by robbers during robberies this year. Of these cases, 70 per cent have been “solved”, with police arresting 52 suspects and killing 11 others in encounters.
During the same period, 189 people were injured in robbery-related shootings. Police claim to have solved 65pc of these cases by arresting 158 suspects and killing five in encounters.
Admitting that street crime remains a major challenge, the Addl IG said there had been a significant decrease in violent incidents. Killings during robbery resistance have dropped by up to 45pc over the past year. Meanwhile, incidents of mobile phone snatching, carjacking, and motorcycle theft have also declined, he added.
He further claimed that kidnapping-for-ransom cases have dropped by 49pc, with 55 abducted victims recovered safely.
Mr Odho also shared that narcotics worth Rs11 billion had been seized in recent police operations.

Nurtleu will undertake an official visit to Pakistan from September 8 to 9, the FO said in a statement, adding that the trip will serve as a precursor to Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s visit scheduled in November 2025.
During his stay, the visiting dignitary will “hold a tête-à-tête” with his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar, followed by delegation-level talks.
Nurtleu is also expected to call on President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif, according to the FO.
“The discussions will provide an opportunity to review preparations for the upcoming presidential visit and to deliberate comprehensively on the entire spectrum of Pak-Kazakh bilateral cooperation, with particular focus on trade and investment, agriculture, education, cultural and tourism exchanges, regional connectivity and logistics, and collaboration at multilateral fora.”
Nurtleu will be accompanied by a high-level 13-member delegation, including the Transport Minister Nurlan Sauranbayev. The Joint Working Groups meetings on agriculture and IT will also be held on the sidelines of the visit.
The Kazakh deputy PM’s visit will “further cement the longstanding Pakistan-Kazakhstan ties and contribute to deepening bilateral engagements in diverse fields, for the benefit of the people of the two countries”, the FO statement added.

In a letter, dated September 1 and addressed to chairman of Wapda, KP finance department noted that the province received Rs3 billion on account of arrears of NHP for the last fiscal on August 18.
The letter pointed out that for the current fiscal, NHP payable to KP was calculated at Rs34.5 billion and accordingly the proportionate share for the month of July and August amounted to Rs5.762 billion, which was yet to be released by Wapda to the province.
Besides, it said that with regard to the arrears of previous financial year 2024-25, out of Rs28.6 billion an amount of Rs6 billion was released to the province during the current fiscal, leaving an outstanding amount of Rs22.8 billion.
CM aide alleges unfair disbursement of funds to provinces
The finance department also said that an amount of Rs42.6 million was also payable to the province by Wapda/federal government on account of five per cent annual indexation for the period 2015-16 to 2024-25.
“Based on the estimated generation data provided by Wapda, the total NHP amount for the said period is also to be settled,” it added.
It has asked Wapda to make necessary arrangements for the release of these outstanding amounts at the earliest.
The adviser to chief minister on finance, Muzzammil Aslam, told
Dawn
that the federal government was unfair in NHP disbursement to provinces. He said that in 2024-25, the federal government disbursed Rs34.58 billion to KP while it released Rs65 billion to Punjab.
“Interestingly, the federal government has provided extra Rs30 billion to Punjab in last quarter of 2024-25 silently supporting the most resourceful province of Pakistan,” said Mr Aslam. Besides, he said that it was urgently demanded to release the outstanding Rs71.7 billion to KP.
He said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had promised Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur during the last meeting of Council of Common Interests (CCI) in May 2025 that next CCI would be called in July to resolve three decades long issue of NHP in the light of AGN Kazi methodology and Jahanzeb Committee formula. “However, so far the prime minister office has failed to fulfil his promise,” he added.
The profit from generation of hydroelectricity, known as net hydel profits (NHP), is payable to those provinces where power plants are located, under the Article 161(2) of the Constitution.
In 2018, the KP government took the issue of full implementation of
Kazi Committee methodology
to CCI, which, in a meeting on April 24, 2018, constituted a committee, headed by the then deputy chairman of Planning Commission to discuss the determination of NHP in light of its decisions.
CCI formed an “out-of-box” committee to act on its report. The committee has so far held at least five meetings but no agreement has been reached over the mechanism to pay Rs1.5 trillion NHP to KP as per Kazi methodology for the period from 2016-17 to 2022-23.
The KP government suggested to the committee that the federal government should pay NHP in line with Article 161(2) of the Constitution, Presidential Order No.3, decisions of CCI from 1991, 1993, 1997, 1998, 2016, 2018 and 2022, and the calculation made by the Jehanzeb Khan committee in the report approved by CCI on Dec 23, 2019.
The provincial government has also been asking the federal government to fund the power house component of Wapda development projects through Public Sector Development Programme instead of revenues coming from Wapda generation tariff to make funds available for the payment of NHP to the province.
KP has also proposed that Centre should transfer hydropower projects to it on analogy of the power generation policies of 1995 and 2015 and outstanding payment of NHP as per Kazi methodology to be made by the federal government till the date of transfer of HPP to provinces, while the operation and maintenance can be retained by Wapda.

flood situation
in the area.
Chief Minister Task Force for Prisons Chairman Rana Manan Khan told Dawn that 565 prisoners at the Sialkot district jail were shifted to the Gujranwala district jail, 274 to the Narowal district jail and 168 to the Hafizabad district jail. He said the prisoners shifted to the Gujranwala, Narowal and Hafizabad jails included both men and women. He said the prisoners had been transferred in order to protect them from the prevailing flood situation.
Meanwhile, labourers from adjoining areas, who worked in factories of Sialkot, had been trapped in their homes and were struggling to eat three square meals a day.
As heavy rains and flash floods in Sialkot have caused severe damage to roads coupled with the closure of industries, thousands of labourers from Pasrur, Chawinda, Badiana, Chaprad, Bajwat and hundreds of villages in the area are finding it hard to earn a living.
The collapse of the bridge near Islam Center on Pasrur-Sialkot road had suspended traffic, while the roads connecting Sialkot from Bhagwal Road, Kushnawali Stop, Head Marala Road, Sherpur, Bajwat and Chaprad Sector and other areas had also been washed away in the flood. Public and private transport had been suspended and workers were trapped in their homes for six days.
Workers Muhammad Ashiq and Muhammad Afzal said that they were unable to reach their jobs. They said that it had become difficult to even afford food and the rains and floods had taken away their livelihoods.
Muhammad Imran, a resident of Kushnawali village, said that his mother was seriously ill and the local doctor had referred her to the Allama Iqbal Memorial Teaching Hospital, Sialkot. However, he was unable to shift her to the hospital due to the dilapidated roads. He said that due to poverty, he could not afford her treatment at private hospitals.
Dozens of villages had been cut-off due to the rains and floods and the floodwater was accumulated in people’s houses and animal shelters. The residents of these villages have been waiting for relief from the government. The affectees have demanded that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz take immediate notice of the situation.

Jinnah House attack
during the May 9, 2023 riots.
The Lahore Police
arrested
Shershah, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from outside his home on August 22. He was then sent on a five-day
physical remand
and later
to jail
for 14 days on August 28.
Today’s development comes a day after Shershah’s triathlete brother, Shahrez Khan, was also granted bail in a similar case. Shahrez was
picked up
on August 21 and was handed over to police custody for
eight days
before his
judicial remand
and bail.
He was released today from Kot Lakpat Jail after paying bail.
In the
last hearing
on Tuesday, the ATC had again granted the prosecution time till today to present the case record in connection with Shershah’s post-arrest bail plea.
ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill presided over the hearing today, where Advocate Rana Mudassar Umer appeared as Shershah’s counsel.
During the hearing, Umer pointed out that the prosecution had
still not produced
the case record in the Jinnah House attack case against Shershah.
“No one knows when the trial will begin. Therefore, the suspect cannot be kept in jail for an unlimited period,” the counsel contended. He asserted that “no evidence” had been produced against his client on the record.
“The suspect was not involved in any riots,” Umer stated, arguing that individuals with more serious charges against them had been given bail in other cases.
“Someone cannot be implicated [in a case] just based on one suspect’s identification of him,” the lawyer contended.
Pointing out the arrest “28 months” after the May 9 incidents, Umer alleged, “Vindictive actions are being taken because of being a part of the PTI founder’s family.
The lawyer called the purported recovery of a cane from Shershah, as per the prosecution, “planted”. He argued that the same ATC had previously discharged PTI’s Dr Yasmin Rashid from a case based on a co-suspect’s statement.
Subsequently, Judge Gill accepted the post-arrest bail plea of Shershah against a surety bond of Rs100,000 and ordered his release, if not needed in any other case.
Umer, on X, said the bail was a “result of teamwork” of the lawyers.
Shershah’s lawyer, Barrister Taimur Malik, also confirmed the bail approval on X.
His cousin, Qasim Zaman Khan, referring to the bails of both brothers, alleged: “These arrests were nothing but political victimisation.”
Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed their
concerns
over the arrests of Shahrez and Shershah, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had
defended
the arrests, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On
May 9, 2023
, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s
arrest
, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party

According to officials representing the Expanded Programme for Immunisation (EPI), the campaign targeting 4.1m girls aged 9 to 14 will run till Sept 27. It will cover all 1,190 union councils across 30 districts, deploying 3,611 teams to schools, madressahs, communities, and EPI centers.
A ceremony was organised at the Khatoon-i-Pakistan Government Girls School, where speakers highlighted the importance of the vaccine, addressing myths and misconceptions.
Cervical cancer, they said, is the second deadliest cancer for women worldwide and a major health threat in Pakistan, with a mortality rate exceeding 65 per cent. HPV is the primary cause of cervical cancer and the vaccine is the first-ever cancer prevention vaccine.
4.1m girls aged nine to 14 will be administered HPV vaccine in all districts
“It’s safe and effective, providing 100 per cent protection from cervical cancer. The campaign symbolises the government’s commitment to protect the health of our daughters. By vaccinating today, we are preventing tomorrow’s tragedies and ensuring a stronger Sindh,” said Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho in her remarks.
The ceremony was attended by musician-turned-social worker Shehzad Roy, Education Minister Sardar Shah, senior health professionals, local and international partners, including experts representing the WHO, Gavi, Unicef and Jhpiego, members of academia, civil society and government officials.
According to officials, Sindh has become the first province in Pakistan to introduce the HPV vaccine into its routine immunisation schedule, aligning with the WHO’s Global Strategy to Eliminate Cervical Cancer.
“This is a milestone in Sindh’s immunisation history. Over 8,000 trained vaccination teams are mobilised across all districts to ensure maximum coverage. Our mission is to reach every eligible girl and protect future generations from the threat of cervical cancer,” said EPI Project Director, Sindh, Dr Raj Kumar.
This vaccine has the potential to make Sindh and Pakistan free from cervical cancer, which has a mortality rate of over 65 per cent, he said.
The first phase of the 12-day vaccination drive (excluding Sundays) will cover girls enrolled in schools and out-of-school girls at community locations (markets, parks, madrassas, vocational centers).
Fixed-site sessions at health facilities and mobile teams in hard-to-reach areas will expand coverage. Catch-up doses will be available for those who miss the initial campaign. Routine HPV vaccination will start from January 2026, targeting nine-year-old girls annually, with continued school outreach.
According to officials, Pakistan is the 149th country to introduce this vaccine into its immunisation schedule. It’s already being used in Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Indonesia.
Later, the health minister inaugurated a health carnival in Sultanabad, marking the launch of the HPV vaccination drive, by the Indus Hospital & Health Network (IHHN).
Speaking at the event, Thabani Maphosa, chief country delivery officer at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said: “A single dose of the HPV vaccine can prevent most cases of cervical cancer. Yet every two minutes, a woman loses her life to this disease, including thousands in Pakistan each year.”
At the event, girls received their free HPV vaccine at the EPI booth, then made impressions with their painted hands on a specially made wall with a banner reading “I Am Vaccinated” — a colorful pledge to protection.
The event featured discussions on cervical cancer and several other activities, highlighting importance of the campaign.

It asserted that it continued to centre its debt management strategy on aligning public debt-to-GDP ratio to the
Debt Limitation Act
, which provides for the reduction of federal fiscal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio to a prudent level by effective public debt management. Moreover, the strategy considered “minimising refinancing and rollover risks while generating interest savings to support sustainable public finances”, the ministry said.

increased
by Rs9 trillion in just one year up to June 2025, with domestic debt representing the ma­­jority of this increase.
As per SBP, the total government debt in­­creased from Rs68.91 trillion in June 2024 to Rs77.89tr by June 2025, marking a rise of Rs8.97tr. This figure exceeds the debt servicing allocation for the federal budget for fiscal year 2026 (FY26), which stands at Rs8.207tr.
Citing these figures, concerns have been raised regarding the country’s capacity to manage revenue and expenditures effectively.

yesterday said Pakistan’s “debt dynamics continue to paint a difficult fiscal picture”.
“For the government, the options are bleak: diverting scarce domestic resources — which would require the IMF’s consent — or borrowing more to add to an already high debt mountain,” it added.
However, the finance ministry, “while noting recent commentary about public debt levels”, maintained in its statement that “absolute numbers, which will naturally rise with inflation, are not meaningful indicators of sustainability in isolation. The appropriate measure of sustainability is looking at debt relative to the size of the economy i.e Debt-to-GDP — not absolute rupee amounts”.
“By this yardstick, which is followed globally, Pakistan’s position has actually improved over the last few years, with debt-to-GDP ratio declining from 74 per cent in FY22 to 70pc in FY25. At the same time, the government has reduced rollover and refinancing risks and saved taxpayers substantial interest costs,” the ministry said.
Detailing its approach towards debt management, the statement outlined debt-to-GDP reduction, early repayments, lower interest costs, and a stronger external account as its main focus.
The ministry said this approach underscored its “commitment to macroeconomic stability, reduced risk, and responsible fiscal management”.
The ministry highlighted that the government, “for the first time in Pakistan’s debt history”, prepaid around Rs2600 billion owed to commercial and central banks before maturity. In doing so, it said, the government reduced the risks of reducing rollover and refinancing, which ultimately led to taxpayers saving “hundreds of billions of rupees in interest savings.”
“Similarly, on the fiscal side, the federal fiscal deficit stood at Rs 7.1tr in FY25, lower than Rs 7.7tr in FY24,” the ministry said, highlighting that Pakistan posted a “historic primary surplus of 2.4pc of GDP, or Rs 2.7tr, for the second consecutive year”.
Consequently, the country’s “total debt stock rose 13pc year-on-year, below the 17pc average growth of the past five years”, it said.
The ministry attributed the record current account surplus of $2bn in FY25 to its “prudent fiscal management.”
“To lower [the] interest burden, prudent liability management along with reduction in interest rate in FY25 delivered over Rs 850bn in interest expense savings compared to the budgeted amount,” the statement said, noting that “in the current fiscal year’s budget, interest allocation is Rs 8.2tr, down from Rs 9.8tr in FY25,” it added.
The ministry further said that the “public-debt average time to maturity has improved to about 4.5 years in FY25 compared to about 4.0 years last year; within this, domestic debt average time to maturity has also risen to over 3.8 years from about 2.7 years.”
Moreover, it said that “part of the increase in external debt reflects balance of payments support, e.g., IMF Extended Fund Facility inflows and non-cash commodity facilities such as the Saudi Oil Fund, that do not require rupee financing.”
“Approximately, Rs 800 billion of the external debt increase is a valuation effect from exchange-rate movements, not new net borrowing,” the statement said.",2025-09-16,Tahir Sherani,1140,0.000145

GILGIT: An injured American paraglider was airlifted by a Pakistan Army Aviation helicopter from Rush Lake, situated at an altitude of 4,694 metres in Nagar.
Two paragliders, Amer­ican national Jessica Courtney Green, 40, and Australian national Shane Owen Tighe, 35, had taken off from Karimabad, Hunza, on Saturday.
According to local police, both paragliders had planned to land at Rush Lake, about 50 kilometres from Karimabad. However, the American paraglider was forced to make a crash-landing. She sustained injuries to her leg, though her condition was initially stated to be stable.
Sources said she had also suffered broken ribs and an ankle injury and was found unconscious. Using a satellite phone, her fellow paraglider informed a friend about the situation, who then sought urgent rescue assistance from local people. Volunteers from Hop­er Valley reached the incident site on Sunday and managed to rescue the injured paraglider, taking her to some distance.
The volunteers stayed overnight in camp, providing food and first aid. On Monday morning, a Pakistan Army Aviation helicopter airlifted the injured American paraglider to Gilgit and later to Skardu. From there, she was shifted to Islamabad on a chartered flight the same day.
Rush Lake is among the world’s highest alpine lakes, located about 15 km north of Miar Peak and Spantik. Tourists usually trek from Hoper Valley, crossing Hoper Glacier and Miar Glacier, to reach the site.
Rakaposhi expedition
Meanwhile, two Ameri­can climbers — Dane Christensen and Craig Orion Lutwyler — have begun an expedition to summit the 7788m Rakaposhi.
According to GB tourism department, both climbers have been issued permits. From Rakaposhi base camp, they started their climbing on Monday. They are being assisted by two local high-altitude porters. The American climbers plan to complete the mission in a month.

ongoing dispute
with Islamabad over the Pakistan Infrastructure Development Company (PIDCL)’s role in the construction of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Green Line extension project in Karachi.
The PPP-led Sindh government said that the project was outside the purview of the federal organisation and asked the PIDCL to “withdraw” from the development projects “at the earliest”.
The move came on Friday when the Sindh local government department issued a letter to the head of the PIDCL, following directives from Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.
The letter was sent after a meeting held at CM House, where the chief minister was briefed on the ongoing development projects in the city and the recent controversy triggered by Mayor Wahab’s decision to halt the Green Line BRT extension project over “procedural violations” by the PIDCL.
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), backed by the PPP-led Sindh government, last week halted the Rs6 billion project of Green Line, citing the PIDCL’s failure to obtain a no objection certificate (NOC) from municipal authorities before restarting the work.
On CM’s instruction, LG dept asks PIDCL to withdraw from uplift projects at the earliest
The KMC officials said the NOC was not issued “in perpetuity” and the PIDCL was required to secure a fresh approval to carry out the work.
Later, talking to
Dawn
, Mayor Wahab openly expressed his intention to completely exclude the PIDCL from Karachi’s infrastructure development projects.
Following the categorical pronouncement, the Sindh chief minister and the provincial government appeared to be aligned with the mayor’s position, formally asking the federal organisation to confine its role strictly to its “agreed mandate”.
“It is brought to your kind attention that as per the explicit understanding reached with the federal government, the PIDCL, as the successor organisation to the now-defunct Pak-PWD, is mandated only to take over and execute the specific development schemes/projects that were previously under the purview of Pak-PWD and does not include any other development schemes pertaining to the province of Sindh,” said the local government department letter to the PIDCL chief.
However, the letter noted with “concern” that the company was extending its role to other development projects in Sindh, going beyond the agreed-upon scope.
“The Karachi Urban Infrastructure Development Package and the Hyderabad Urban Infrastructure Development Package are provincial initiatives that do not fall under the ambit of PIDCL’s mandate. The execution of these schemes by your organisation is contrary to the understanding reached between the provincial and federal governments and creates impediments to coordinated development efforts,” said the letter.
The mayor last week also emphasised that any project in Karachi, regardless of federal funding, should be carried out through local agencies. He stated that if a project was related to a specific town, it should be managed by the respective town administration. For projects concerning the entire city, the KMC should take responsibility.
The Sindh leadership has now endorsed the mayor’s stance.
“It is requested the PIDCL’s role may be withdrawn from any and all other development projects within the province of Sindh at the earliest and ensure that PIDCL’s involvement is strictly limited to the portfolio of schemes inherited from the defunct Pak-PWD,” added the letter.

• Four civilians killed in Bajaur blast, caused by old explosive device
• State minister warns militants to be met with bullets if talks fail
• Says 80pc attackers are Afghans; urges political unity to tackle challenge
LAKKI MARWAT/ BAJAUR: Seventeen militants were killed in an intelligence-based oper­ation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district on Friday night, while four civilians fell victim to an explosion in the Bajaur district on Saturday.
Three security personnel were also injured in the operation conducted in the Darshakhel area of Karak.
The operation was conducted “on the reported presence of khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and, resultantly, 17 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” it added.
Karak District Police Officer Shahbaz Elahi said that the police and security forces launched the operation in the remote rural area within the limits of Shah Slaim police station on information about the presence of militants there.
“We had credible reports that terrorists affiliated with the Mullah Nazir group of banned Tehreek-i-Taliban were present in the area with an intention to execute their nefarious plans,” he said.
He added that an intense exchange of fire took place when security personnel reached the area and started laying a siege around the mountainous hideouts of militants.
“The fierce gun battle lasted for several hours, resulting in the killing of 17 Fitna al Khwarij terrorists and their six accomplices were injured,” Mr Elahi said.
“The anti-state and anti-peace elements will not find any place to hide and the police and security forces will carry out joint operations to eliminate them,” the district police chief added.
Another police official said that heavy contingents of police and security forces remained present in the area on Saturday and continued search in the mountains on the border between Lakki Marwat and Mianwali districts for the injured and fleeing militants.
He said that announcements were made in the Darshakhel and adjacent villages and hamlets, advising people to stay indoors as the operation was underway.
“People were also advised not to allow anyone to enter their houses seeking shelter and cooperate with police and security forces,” he added.
Bajaur explosion
In Bajaur’s Lowi Mam­und tehsil, four people were killed and two critically injured when an un­­e­­xploded device went off in a field in the Laghari area on Saturday afternoon, officials and locals said.
They told Dawn that the tragedy occurred in the Laghari area around 3pm when a group of local youths were passing through the field.
Israr Khan, public relations officer of the district police in Khar, confirmed that the blast was caused by an old explosive device.
Riaz Ahmed Khan, a spokesman for Rescue 1122 Khar station, told Dawn that among the four fatalities, one person died at the scene, while others were pronounced dead upon arrival at Khar’s district hospital. He said that the victims were identified as Sajad Khan, 18; Nawshad Khan, 13; Faw­ad Khan, 18; and Jawad Khan, 15.
The official mentioned that 17-year-old Waqas Khan and 15-year-old Attaullah were among the wounded. They were initially taken to the district headquarters hospital in Khar but were later airlifted to a hospital in Peshawar via a specially arranged Frontier Corps North helicopter for adv­anced medical treatment.
Local political leaders from the ANP, JI, and PTI visited Khar Hospital to donate blood and express solidarity with the families.
PTI MPA Dr Hamidur Rehman said he would press authorities for the early return of displaced residents to their homes.
Talal Chaudhry
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Saturday that Pakistan’s response to militancy would be firm, suggesting those “who understand the language of bullets will be explained with bullets” if negotiations with Afghanistan fail to stop cross-border attacks.
Speaking at a press conference, he described Pakistan’s diplomacy as at a 75-year high and defended ongoing security operations.
Mr Chaudhry said terrorism remained the cou­ntry’s biggest challenge and insisted the government was committed to making Pakistan safe for investment.
“Today red carpets are being laid for the prime minister abroad,” he said, contrasting current diplomatic outreach with past isolation. He added that federal and provincial governments must cooperate closely on security.
The minister accused militants of entering Pakistan from across the border and charged that “80 per cent of terrorist attackers are Afghans”.
Mr Chaudhry said the government would streng­then measures to prevent cross-border infiltration, curb sectarian violence and stabilise restive areas.
He called on all political parties to unite for nat­io­nal development and noted that foreign observers acknow­ledged impro­vements in Pakistan’s security situation.
On media conduct, he warned journalists again­­st supporting “those who hide behind the guise of journalists” and critici­s­­ed what he described as “false vloggers” who, he said, traded national security for money. He said the government was taking action against such individuals and hinted that laws could be further toughened.

that Shershah had been released from Kot Lakhpat jail.
He also posted about his release in a post on X, along with a picture of his co-counsel and Shershah himself.
In the

on Tuesday, the ATC had again granted the prosecution time till today to present the case record in connection with Shershah’s post-arrest bail plea.
ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill presided over the hearing today, where Advocate Rana Mudassar Umer appeared as Shershah’s counsel.
During the hearing, Umer pointed out that the prosecution had still not produced the case record in the Jinnah House attack case against Shershah.
“No one knows when the trial will begin. Therefore, the suspect cannot be kept in jail for an unlimited period,” the counsel contended. He asserted that “no evidence” had been produced against his client on the record.
“The suspect was not involved in any riots,” Umer stated, arguing that individuals with more serious charges against them had been given bail in other cases.
“Someone cannot be implicated [in a case] just based on one suspect’s identification of him,” the lawyer contended.
Pointing out the arrest “28 months” after the May 9 incidents, Umer alleged, “Vindictive actions are being taken because of being a part of the PTI founder’s family.
The lawyer called the purported recovery of a cane from Shershah, as per the prosecution, “planted”. He argued that the same ATC had previously discharged PTI’s Dr Yasmin Rashid from a case based on a co-suspect’s statement.

In July, PICSS
documented
82 militant attacks across the country, resulting in 101 fatalities and 150 injuries, a 5pc rise in militant attacks compared to June.
According to the think tank, those killed in July’s militant attacks included 47 civilians, 36 security personnel, and 18 militants. Among the injured were 90 civilians, 52 security personnel, seven militants, and a member of a peace committee.
“With 143 militant attacks recorded, August became the deadliest month in over a decade, surpassing all monthly figures since February 2014, as per the PICSS Militancy Database,” the think tank’s latest report read.
The wave of violence left 194 people dead, including 73 security forces personnel, 62 civilians, 58 militants, and one pro-government peace committee member, according to PICSS.
Additionally, 231 others were injured, comprising 129 security personnel, 92 civilians, eight militants, and two peace committee members. Militants also abducted at least 10 individuals during the month.
“In response, security forces escalated their operations, killing at least 100 militants and arresting 31 others across the country. However, these actions also led to the deaths of three civilians and one security personnel,” according to PICSS.
When accounting for both militant attacks and security operations, at least 298 individuals lost their lives in August. These included 158 militants, 74 security forces personnel, 65 civilians, and one peace committee member.
The number of injured also rose to 250, with 137 security personnel, 100 civilians, 11 militants, and two peace committee members affected. PICSS observed a 100pc increase in security forces’ deaths and a 145pc rise in injuries compared to July. Militant fatalities rose by 27pc, while civilian deaths climbed 20pc.
The report highlighted that the most alarming escalation occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the tribal districts, which saw 51 militant attacks — a 200pc increase. These attacks resulted in 74 deaths, marking a 124pc rise.
The rest of KP was also similarly hit, with 55 attacks causing 56 deaths, including 26 security personnel, 22 civilians, and eight militants. In total, KP witnessed 106 militant attacks, the highest monthly figure in over 10 years, according to PICSS.
Operations were launched in Bajaur and North Waziristan, “resulting in partial clearance of militant hideouts, although the situation remains tense,” the think tank added.
Balochistan followed with 28 attacks, resulting in 52 deaths — 23 security personnel, 21 civilians, and eight militants. Another 45 people were wounded, including 23 security personnel and 22 civilians.
“Security forces eliminated 50 militants in the province — the highest number of militant deaths in operations since June 2015, when 60 were killed,” according to PICSS.
Sindh reported six attacks, leaving eight people dead — six civilians and two security personnel. Security forces arrested 11 suspected militants, all in Karachi.
In Punjab, two attacks occurred: a banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) assault in Dera Ghazi Khan, and an unsolved killing of a young cleric in Rawalpindi. resulting in the deaths of one civilian and one attacker.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, TTP-linked militants struck Chilas district, killing two security personnel and injuring one.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
The government
labelled
the TTP as
Fitna-al-Khawarij
and directed the use of the term khariji for attackers. It later
designated
Balochistan-based groups as
Fitna-al-Hindustan

highlight
India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
On Sunday, President Asif Ali Zardari signed into law the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill, 2025, seeking to improve counterterrorism efforts while ensuring legal oversight and safeguards.

Last year, Sindh became the first province to
introduce
a teaching licence test under its teaching licence policy — introduced in 2023 — in a bid to ensure a higher calibre of educators in schools.
According to a notification issued by the department, a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
, “only registered and licensed teachers will be authorised to teach at schools”, for which the education department will set up a regulatory body.
The regulatory body will be responsible for issuing licences, as well as renewing them based on the teachers’ performance, the notification said.
The establishment of the licensing regulatory body aims to “improve the quality of education”, enhance student learning outcomes, by ensuring that only “licensed and professionally qualified” teachers are allowed to teach at schools.
The 15-member body will oversee the development and implementation of a standardised licensing framework, as well as develop robust teaching standards via routine performance evaluations and reviews.
The education department has allocated a budget of Rs200 million for the establishment of the regulatory body.
KP’s education system has been facing persistent challenges. In November last year, over 5,200 community-school teachers in remote girls’ schools went without pay for eight months, disrupting the education of 276,000 students

hunting permits
for 118 animals for the 2025–26 season on Wednesday, with the top permit for an Astore markhor fetching $370,000.
The event took place at the Forest, Parks, and Wildlife Complex in Gilgit, with numerous outfitters and hunters participating in the bidding, during which the department auctioned permits for the trophy hunting of four Astore markhors, 100 Himalayan ibexes, and 14 blue sheep.
The second-highest permit for an Astore markhor sold for $286,000, while the top permits for a blue sheep and a Himalayan ibex went for $40,000 and $13,000, respectively.
“This is a record for the highest markhor hunting permit bid in the world and in Pakistan,” GB conservator for Parks and Wildlife Khadim Abbas told
Dawn
.
Top permit for Astore markhor sold for $370,000
He noted that the previous highest-priced permit in Pakistan was auctioned by the Khyber Pak­h­tunkhwa wildlife department in Chitral last year for $271,000.
Shikar Safaris Owner Raja Farhad Maqpoon placed the winning $370,000 bid for a permit in the Nanga Parbat conservancy area.
The other two Astore markhor permits sold for $270,000 and $240,000. The highest bids for both the blue sheep and Himalayan ibex permits were won by M Ali Nagri of Markhor Safaris.
For the upcoming season, the department raised the base price for an Astore markhor permit to $200,000, up from $150,000 last year.
The base prices for blue sheep and Himalayan ibex were set at $30,000 and $10,000, up from $9,000 and $5,500, respectively. In the 2024-25 season, the highest bid for a markhor was $161,000.
However, some local outfitters and tour operators argued the sharp fee hikes are discouraging international clients and could harm their businesses.
“If the true spirit of conservation is replaced with short-term financial gains for local communities, the model will lose its foundation and is likely to collapse within a few years, leaving both wildlife and communities at a greater loss,” said Ikram Baig, president of the GB Association of Tour Operators.
The trophy hunting programme in Gilgit-Baltistan was launched in 1990 and is credited with helping protect endangered species.
Under the programme, local communities receive about 80 percent of the revenue from hunting permits to be used for conservation and development projects. Stakeholders now fear the latest price hikes could jeopardise its sustainability.

urban flooding
, criticising the obstruction of waterways as a violation of natural processes.
Speaking to the media during his visit to parts of the city, he said that no government had sanctioned permanent housing developments in riverbeds.
“No government has authorised the construction of permanent housing societies in riverbeds, but obstructing the natural flow of rivers goes against nature — and that is precisely what has happened here,” he noted.
Mr Shah said the provincial government, along with elected representatives and civic institutions, was working around the clock to safeguard citizens as heavy rains and rising river levels posed fresh challenges across the province.
“At present, provincial ministers and senior officers of the administration are with me in the field,” he said.
He expressed deep sorrow over the loss of
four lives
in Malir during the night, adding that rescue teams had saved several people trapped near the Korangi causeway earlier in the morning.
Highlighting the scale of rainfall, the chief minister stated that heavy showers had also been reported in Hyderabad, Thatta, Sujawal, Badin, Tharparkar, Jamshoro and Dadu.
He noted that small dams in Tharparkar had filled up, which brought relief to local communities.
Earlier, he conducted an extensive visit to the city to review the situation following heavy monsoon rains.
The chief minister first visited Qayyumabad and the Korangi causeway, where he inspected the dewatering operation.
He remarked that the Korangi causeway resembled a river and directed authorities to ensure its clearance once the flow of the Malir river subsided.
He later visited Shahrah-i-Bhutto and inspected the Malir river outfall, where Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah briefed him about overnight rescue operations. He noted that the release of water from the Malir river would help clear the Korangi causeway.
CM Shah also visited Saadi Town via Malir Cantonment, where he was informed that overflow from Lath and Thado dams had entered the town through the motorway.
Later, he visited Jinnah Avenue, where he inspected the drainage system connected to Mehran Nala and checked the machinery installed there. From Jinnah Avenue, he proceeded to the Lyari River to review the drainage situation.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940891,Potential to prosperity - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"EVERY $1 invested in nutrition yields $23 in economic returns according to global studies. This is particularly true when that investment happens early, from conception to two years of age, when the brain and body grow at their fastest, requiring adequate amounts of essential nutrients.
The returns are real: they are seen in children who grow and develop well, stay healthier, remain in school longer and grow into productive adults. Good nutrition reduces healthcare costs, strengthens communities, and drives national progress.
But the reverse is equally true — when this investment is missed, the costs are devastating, with inaction projected to cost $41 trillion globally over the next 10 years. Malnutrition robs children of their potential and nations of their future. It weakens bodies and impairs cognitive development, locking families into cycles of poverty that can last for generations.
The world is off track to end
malnutrition
— a crisis that contributes to nearly half of all deaths among children under five and one in five maternal deaths.
In Pakistan today, nearly 40 per cent, and in the poorest quintile 50pc, of children are
stunted
. Stunting means a child is too short for their age, signalling prolonged inadequate nutrition, which affects not only growth in length, but also short- and long-term health and development, and is largely irreversible.
Nutrition is Pakistan’s best investment.
These risks are compounded in times of crisis. The recent
flash floods
in Pakistan illustrate how quickly climate shocks can undo progress: crops destroyed, livelihoods lost and families displaced. In such emergencies, women and children face the greatest burden — with disrupted access to food, healthcare and safe water, the dangers of malnutrition intensify.
Targeted interventions during pregnancy and early childhood are critical, particularly for the poorest households. Across Pakistan’s provinces, 73-87pc of all households cannot afford a diverse, nutritious diet, with cost being 1.5 to 1.7 times higher than households’ current food expenditure (Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, 2024). This results in large dietary gaps, even larger among the poorest households, leaving much of their food and nutritional needs unmet.
Global evidence shows that the most effective nutrition programmes combine specialised nutritious foods, access to maternal and child health services, social and behaviour change, communication to promote breastfeeding and complementary feeding, to improve diets within the families’ means.
Pakistan’s Benazir Nashonuma Program­­me stands as an evidence-based global example of these best practices. Implemented under the Benazir Income Support Programme, Nashonuma combines conditional cash transfers, integrated health services, nutrition counselling, and specialised nutritious foods for pregnant and breastfeeding women and children under two.
The specialised nutritious food provided — Maamta for mothers and Wawamum for children — consists of 50-75 grams of nutrient-packed paste made from chickpeas and other ingredients such as vegetable oil, skimmed milk powder and vitamin and mineral premix, designed to fill critical nutrient gaps during pregnancy, breastfeeding and early childhood.
In many low-income households, diets are repetitive, often consisting of foods of just one to three of eight food groups, dominated by cereals, and lacking nutrient-rich foods such as eggs, milk, fish, fruit and vegetables.
The specialised food does not replace daily meals, it fills critical nutrient gaps that current diets of this target group cannot address, es­­p­ecially during pregnancy and early chi­ldhood. For long-term impact, it must remain part of the comprehensive pac-kage while efforts to improve dietary di­­v­ersity continue.
The model is showing promising results according to preliminary results of an independent impact evaluation. While no single approach can solve the nutrition crisis alone, such evidence underscores that when interventions are comprehensive, targeted and delivered at scale, they can move the needle quickly.
For Pakistan, investing in early life nutrition, especially during the first 1,000 days, is a smart economic strategy, and as the country responds to ongoing floods, protecting early life nutrition must remain a priority. This aligns with Pakistan’s commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals and the Scaling Up Nutrition Movement.
The country already knows what works. The task now is to sustain and strengthen proven approaches, ensure they reach the most vulnerable households, and safeguard the core elements that make them effective, including targeted nutrition support.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944212/punjab-govt-orders-fresh-probe-into-faisalabad-children-hospital-scam,Punjab govt orders fresh probe into Faisalabad Children Hospital ‘scam’ - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has ordered de novo inquiry proceedings against a senior medical officer/ex-medical superintendent (MS) of the Children Hospital Faisalabad for allegedly committing blatant violation of procurement and financial rules, as well as for continuation of irregular and unauthiorised execution of maintenance and repair work.
The ex-MS was also accused of giving ‘undue’ favour to a private firm which was owned by his wife.
The health secretary appointed Prof Dr Tayyiba Wasim, the professor of obstetrics and gynaecology(BS-21 officer) of the Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore, as an inquiry officer and directed to submit a detailed report in this respect within 60 days.
The new proceedings were initiated in light of the findings of the earlier inquiry wherein the serious allegations were proved true against the ex-MS of the Children Hospital Faisalabad and he was awarded punishment of removal from service under section 4(1)(b)(v) of the PEEDA Act, 2006, besides issuing an order for the recovery of Rs 135,463,284 from him for causing loss to the national exchequer.
Earlier inquiry finds ex-MS guilty
According to the inquiry report, the construction of Children Hospital comprises two phases.
In the first phase, OPD & Emergency Block was constructed and made functional. The administration decided to construct different partitions in the building without obtaining approval from the competent authority like P&D, buildings and specialised healthcare and medical education departments. The report stated that no PC-I for amendment in the newly-constructed block was available.
The report pointed out that the officer in-question allegedly violated the PPRA rules and did not prepare any detailed estimates.
Further administrative and technical sanction was not obtained from the competent authority.
“He executed the maintenance and repair work and procurement related items against a huge amount of Rs 55,770,550 during 2019-20 and 2020-21 without provision/allocation of funds in violation of the relevant rules”, reads the report.
He executed the construction/repair work amounting to Rs29,044,160 in violation of the rules.
The major portion of building work (Rs24,691,420) relates to the construction of different partitions in the hospital building which have been built with fragile material i.e. gypsum and lamination sheets etc. and much risky in terms of durability and safety.
Similarly, the officer procured hi-tech electric wire of 500 metre length (25 mm 4 core) against a huge amount of Rs12,751,000.
As per demand the purpose of the same was not known, the inquiry report said. Furthermore, agencies like Fesco/Public Works Department etc. were not contacted for technical assessment before procurement of such hi-tech wire.
He procured another hi-tech electric wire of 675 RF length ((300 m 4 core) for Rs10,665,000 for electric construction of an angiography machine (Siemens).
Accordingly, various discrepancies were found in procurement.
Pointing out one of the major discrepancies, the report stated that the machine was received by the hospital on June 27, 2020 but the wire for connection was demanded on Aug 28, 2019 and the same was received in the hospital on March 9, 2020.
“So, it is evident that wire 675 RF length (300 m 4 core) for the machine was procured without technical assessment and requirement”, reads the report.
Similarly, the supplying firm or Bio Medical Engineer of the hospital was required to assess the strength and the length of the required wire, but no such report was available on record.
The packing list of the said machine was not available in the record to check whether the wire was supplied by the company with the machine or not.
During the financial year 2020-21, funds worth Rs411,000 were allocated under the head of Office Building.
Later on, Rs8,000,000 were further allocated/re-appropriated in the said head by the government.
Out of total allocation of Rs8,411,000, only Rs732,057 were utilised and an amount of Rs7,678,943 was lapsed by the hospital administration.
“He created liabilities amounting to Rs150,630,000 in various other heads of accounts by placing procurement orders without observing the availability of funds under relevant heads as per data provided by the current administration,” reads the report
The report stated that Mst. Razia Saadi, owner of M/S Climax Traders, is the wife of Dr Abid Hussain, the then AMS Purchase during the observation and later on he was also entrusted the additional charge of medical superintendent of the hospital.
“Maintenance, procurement & repair/construction work executed and made so during the financial years 2019-20 and 2020-21 was unlawful/unauthorised. The conflict of interest exists in case of awards to M/s Climax Traders and all the awards made to the firm are result of undue favoritism”, says the report.
The inquiry officer, Tausief Fatima, said the charges had been proven and she recommended major penalties against Dr Hussain and other responsible officials. She proposed recovery ofRs135,463,284, forfeiture of five years of past service, and additional inquiries against the medical superintendent during the relevant period.
Later, an additional secretary (admin) of the health department provided an opportunity of hearing to the guilty officer and then endorsed the above-mentioned penalties besides proposing another major punishment of removal from service.
An official of the health department said that the de novo inquiry proceeding has been initiated against Dr Abid Hussain following the directions of the Punjab Services Tribunal.

This was stated by MPA Mir Nadir Magsi, who is considered to be an expert in flood-fighting and has been assigned to oversee strengthening of different dykes within the Indus course across Northern Dadu Division.
“At this moment, flows from [Guddu and Sukkur barrages] at peak at Moria Loop Bund — one of the most vulnerable to erosion dykes in the region. By tonight or tomorrow, floodwater will start receding,” he told
Dawn
on Friday evening while supervising the ongoing strengthening work at the bund.
Expert in flood-fighting, MPA Nadir Magsi wants government to do more for safe passage of deluges; says round-the-clock monitoring underway at many dykes
“We are standing on the ‘highly sensitive’ Moria Loop Bund on the right side. In the recent past, floodwater used to flow straight downwards from the spur of this dyke, but now it turns around in a loop and comes back. So, stones are being stocked here. That’s why [more] work on the protective bund is essential, coupled with strict vigilance,” he said.
In reply to a question, he said water has to pass through all three bridges — Larkana-Khairpur, Dadu-Moro and Amri-Sehwan — “but the question is how much damage the floodwater can cause to dykes and bridges“.
“At present, the quantum of floodwater, equal to five days’ flow, is entering the river in 20 days; clearly, there is an obstruction,” he said.
“These bridges have been built, and whatever civil engineers have done, they have done, but floodwater always mounts immense pressure on dykes. This issue must be addressed,” he said.
Remedial measures suggested
MPA Magsi said that if open culverts are built on the roads over the embankments on the other side (left side), then the water will automatically rise and pass through, even if a road is above it. And if the water level is low, it will not cross. Roads should be built with culverts, so there will be no backflow of water, he said. He said the water must be given a passage, and the bridges should be reviewed.
“For this, I will take a paper to President [Asif Ali Zardari] about these bridges, because even the president’s own district, Nawabshah, has been affected by the Amri Bridge,” he said.
The MPA said it is not possible to build bridges between each embankment because this would involve a hefty amount of money. Therefore, funds should be allocated in the Annual Development Programme for culverts, so that flows of 20,000 or 40,000 cusecs can pass safely.
Position of bridges
MPA Magsi was briefed at the site by the chief engineer, superintending engineer and executive engineers with the help of maps and satellite images. They showed him that all three bridges were of small length as compared to the width of the river at these points.
The Larkana-Khairpur Bridge is just 1.2 kilometres long, as against the river’s width of 13 kilometres at this point. The engineers said that due to the narrow passage, floodwater naturally exerts pressure in the shape of backflow on dykes.
Flood situation
They said the peak flow would safely pass through Larkana within the next 24 hours, adding that dykes stood intact. The chief engineer right bank, sharing the current flows in the Indus, said that Guddu Barrage was in low flood now with an inflow of 376,300 cusecs and outflow of 347,969 cusecs.
The inflow at Sukkur Barrage is 482,090 cusecs and outflow 428,710 cusecs while the inflow at Kotri Barrage is 328,142 cusecs and outflow 306,887 cusecs.
He said Sukkur and Kotri barrages are in medium flood at the moment.
Flood peak causes damage
The peak of flood is currently passing through the dykes falling within the jurisdiction of Northern Dadu Division and mounting pressure on Moria, Hakra and Abad dykes — located in Larkana district.
The irrigation officials posted at the Moria Loop Bund told
Dawn
on Friday that it had caused damage to a portion of T-Spur, developing a situation that had prompted them to construct a stud in the downstream close to that T-Spur. They had started dumping heavy stones to urgently build it so as to remain on the safe side in case any more harm is done to the existing spur.
The Chief Engineer of Right Bank Mukhtiar Abro, Superintendent Engineer Northern Dadu Division and a host of other irrigation officials were present at the dyke to monitor the situation.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939975,DESTROYING KARACHI THROUGH ‘DEVELOPMENT’ - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"Once in discussion with urban advocates and legal aid representatives, the concept of ‘
farsh se arsh
’ [from the ground to the sky] was explained through rights to environment, rights of living and human dignity — humans and non-humans co-sharing environments from the soil to sky.
This concept has become a critical junction in today’s urban planning. For most of human history, we have designed in harmony with other species. This is important to keep in mind for architects and developers exploring the spatial, cultural and ecological impacts of the industrialised, built-environment.
However, this is not the case in Karachi. As the
urban flooding
across the city on August 19, 2025 in the aftermath of torrential downpour demonstrated yet again, Karachi’s ‘urban planning’ has left the city and its inhabitants standing at a perilous juncture. The relentless building of
high-rises
, destruction of coastal lines, lack of city planning and brazen flouting of building safety laws have led to Karachi literally drowning in infrastructural problems.
So how did Karachi end up in such a mess? The reasons are multi-layered and are the consequence of decades of neglect and misplaced priorities. Over the years, Karachi has seen its
master plans
being routinely disregarded, zoning laws becoming ineffective, high-rises being built without consideration for safety regulations and rampant commercialisation in urban centres that simply lack the infrastructure to support such relentless ‘growth’.
The havoc wreaked by the recent rains in Karachi was a reminder that the megapolis exists today in a fragile ecosystem, due in large part to rampant urban ‘development’ and aggressive real-estate projects. How did the city arrive at this juncture and can it still be saved?
As a consequence, Karachi has many densely built localities where people have no choice but to live in poorly ventilated, poorly lit, tightly-packed buildings in the middle of urban centres that are already wrestling with issues of
traffic congestion
and
sanitation
. Beyond this, the environmental ramifications of such unregulated urban development and the systematic erasure of so many green spaces across the city has only served to increase the likelihood of urban flooding in Karachi.
Land use in Karachi is entirely determined by land value. As a result, the majority has always witnessed slow violence in the form of pollution, environmental degradation, congestion and degradation of the right to life. It is established that the temporalities of development and urban interventions have not catered to the needs of the majority.
Karachi’s vertical expansion illustrates the city’s isolated high-stakes approach to urban development, where real estate developers are scrambling to exploit the bubble formed over mixed-use land. Enabling legal frameworks and a lack of adherence to master plans have allowed the city to undergo major transformations since the early 2000s, when major road arteries were commercialised by the former mayor of Karachi Naimatullah Khan. The impact of unchecked urban development and commercial
pattis
[rows of shops] located below high-rise residential buildings is cause for great concern.
But before diving into the specifics of Karachi’s urban development issues, it is imperative to understand how the changes in the city’s social demography and the rise of the nuclear family model catalysed the haphazard ‘development’ path Karachi has been on for decades.
UNDERSTANDING THE URBAN FAMILY MODEL
Contrary to what some may think, high- and mid-rise development in Karachi is not a new phenomenon. Since the time of the British, areas such as Saddar featured commercial strips, with owners residing in the upper floors, culminating in mixed-use urban form that has persisted post-Partition.
These high-rise buildings often housed tight-knit communities, bound by ethnicity, religion or class, creating cross-functional networks of care and trust. This social architecture softened the blows of Karachi’s sprawling heterogeneity.
As Partition gradually reshaped the city’s demography, the development of high-rise residences laid a particular emphasis on housing particular ethnic groups, such as Sindhis, Parsis, Memons etc. However, this devolved into a utilitarian model based solely on profit, as the real estate economy grew in the city at an alarming pace.
Over the past few decades, residential buildings have evolved into multi-ethnic hubs retaining the built form: commercial pattis tucked between stacked apartments based more on functionality than rigid zoning. This organic ‘development’ shaped Karachi’s economy, creating a kind of vertical densification.
According to Amber Ali Bhai, head of the non-profit Shehri - Citizens for a Better Environment, “It’s basically a mental ghetto of the people, and that’s how they feel comfortable… they feel it’s about safety in numbers.”
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s (MQM) rise in the late 1970s radically altered Karachi’s social fabric, where safety became a heightened concern. The concept of a high-rise — due to more people together, one entrance and a watchman to guard it — grew popular among the middle class. Political violence forced the people of Karachi to retreat behind closed doors and gates.
The shift towards high-rise residential buildings catalysed the transition of joint-family systems into nuclear families, with women gaining more autonomy within the home. Ethnically skewed master plans, once a tool of segregation, lost their importance in the face of undocumented wealth and increased private mobility. Accessibility became a given, as people moved beyond their designated enclaves, perpetuating fractured urban identity.
So, if the city’s master plans have become less and less important over the years, what rubric is being followed when copious amounts of real-estate projects are being green-lit across the city?
As demonstrated by these satellite images, Karachi has the lowest green cover among the world’s major cities, making luxury ‘eco-developments’ pure performance, not protection
THE CRUMBLING IMPORTANCE OF MASTER PLANS AND CONVENTIONAL PLANNING
Over the years, Karachi’s master plans have been reduced to suggestions rather than law. The city’s urban and infrastructural development has grown speculative and disconnected from the ecological realities of the region. As the world moves towards efficient city planning, Karachi’s government remains rooted in conventional methods.
These plans are created by the same regulatory bodies tasked with enforcement, such as the Karachi Development Authority (KDA), creating a conflict of interest. The city finds itself grappling with a top-down approach, where high-rises appear in low-density zones and civic infrastructure is either reactive or entirely missing. Karachi’s land-use policy continues to fragment its urban fabric, inviting irreversible damage through poorly conceived flyovers, commercial encroachments and the destruction of green buffers.
Political misalignment has cost Karachi far more than the Sindh Government is willing to admit. Naimatullah Khan’s controversial commercialisation of major road networks in the early 2000s set a precedent for bypassing city-level planning in favour of short term revenue. This divorce between the policymakers and key stakeholders continued with disjointed policies, such as the Sindh High Density Act 2010 that was introduced by the prime minister at the time without due consultation with urban planners.
This results in a governance model where decisions about a city’s future are made without architects, urban planners and the public. Barring key stakeholders from decision-making ensures that development serves capital, not communities. Infrastructure falters, as essential services such as water, sewerage and electricity buckle. This is all the more evident in the poorly planned commercial centres that litter the city.
COMMERCIAL-ORIENTED GROWTH CENTRES
Markets, over the course of history, have been at the gravitational core of cities, surrounded by homes, institutions and power. Karachi mirrors this historical blueprint with a contemporary evolution — its markets are malls. Dolmen City, Lucky One and Dolmen Mall Tariq Road are examples of how new markets serve as hyper-condensed urban cores.
Using satellite imagery over the past 15 years, negative (open) spaces were mapped to showcase urban development around these nodes. Their placement is strategic. Through the absorption of consumer attention, these malls anchor surrounding high-rise development and create retail-service ecosystems that uphold the precedent set by older commercial pattis.
Yet, in Karachi’s context, this urban density comes at a grave cost. Unlike historic centres that grew in response to public need, the emergence of mall-centric cities reflects French sociologist Henri Lefebvre’s concept of “abstract space”, which is conceived by and for capital, often disconnected from infrastructural and ecological realities.
Water lines remain unchanged, sewerage systems overloaded, while vertical real-estate forests grow around malls, prioritising accessibility for consumption over sustainability. This evolution reshapes the city’s skyline, replacing communal space with transactional zones.
So who is to blame for this unregulated transformation of Karachi’s cityscape and why are the laws designed to prevent such issues proving to be ineffective?
ZONING LAWS AND THE POLITICS OF COMMERCIALISATION
The fault in this regard lies not in our stars, but in ourselves — so let’s illustrate this issue with an example.
On March 13, 2025, the SBCA proposed to
amend Chapter 19
of the Karachi Building and Town Planning Regulations (KBTPR) 2002. This clause allowed the redefinition of plots meant for “residential use” to more revenue-driven establishments, including educational centres, healthcare clinics and for other recreational purposes. Framed as “a change for the public good”, it obscured the distinction between residential, amenity and commercial plots, disrupting legal and architectural zone-planning.
However, the SBCA’s proposition faced widespread criticism for breaching constitutional and administrative jurisdiction. Civil society actors, including Shehri - Citizens for a Better Environment and the Public Interest Law Association of Pakistan (PILAP), among other public-interest petitioners, highlighted to the Sindh High Court that the role of re-categorising land-use is reserved with planning authorities such as the KDA or the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), instead of the SBCA.
Petitioners further referenced Articles 9 and 14 of Chapter 1, Part II of the Constitution of Pakistan, in particular the right to life and privacy — highlighting that this attempt to broaden the scope of “residential use” unilaterally was an unlawful exercise of power that threatened the existing legal framework, public space protection and civic amenities. Bhai stated that these “cul-de-sacs are being turned into cash-cows”, transforming the built-environment of residential neighbourhoods without any public input.
The High Court acknowledged the matter on April 8, 2025 and
issued notices
to the SBCA, KDA and KMC, halting the implementation of the clause. Met with increasing civic pressure, legal review and questions over jurisdiction, the SBCA withdrew the notification on May 13, 2025.
Multiple high-rises can be seen surrounding the area where the Homi Katrak Mansion stands on Abdullah Haroon Road: areas such as this, with high cultural nodes and low-density architecture, have now been surrounded by vertical construction
However, this incident is far from an isolated episode and merely sheds light on a broader pattern of unplanned development and legal circumvention. In the 1980s, zone-planning across Karachi generally allowed neighbourhoods around Gulshan-i-Iqbal and North Nazimabad to develop buildings that were ground floor plus one (G+1) and ground floor plus two (G+2). High-rises were scarce and necessitated civic infrastructure guarantees.
By the 1990s, however, there was a significant shift: commercial corridors were planned along previously low-density areas such as Sharae Faisal, Tariq Road and University Road, opening the door to mid-rise G+4 developments.
During the 2000s, the KBTPR 2002 institutionalised this shift in development by upgrading the Floor Area Ratios (FARs) from 1.75:1 to 3:1, or even 4:1 — which allowed the construction of more total covered floor space on the same plot of land, thus leading to much more vertical development — and enabling developers to escape liability by paying amnesty fees, allowing practices that benefit the builders. As architect Arif Belgaumi notes, “Nobody builds 100 percent of what is allowable, they build 120 percent.”
Once, a single family was housed on a residential plot in areas such as Gulshan, Hyderi or Jauhar. Now, 50 to 60 families, often over 1,000 people, including service staff, occupy the same space in high-rises reaching G+40. This increases the burden on the nearby roads and on G+2/3 buildings, in terms of water, energy and waste management.
This desire for high-rise construction is a constant cause of concern, because such projected structures hinder wind rotation and sunlight, thereby worsening air quality. Despite these pressures, the SBCA’s intervention is rare.
Despite the Supreme Court ban on using residential and amenity plots for commercial use, 930 conversions have taken place in Karachi since the start of 2024, as per the SBCA’s own admission. This increasing disconnect between law and implementation reveals what urban planner Ananya Roy calls “informality from above”, when the state selectively enforces or suspends rules to enable speculative development under a façade of legality.
This prompts an important inquiry into where our policies go from here, emphasising the role of legal mechanisms in pushing public interest development or facilitating selective evasion of laws. Such regularised inconsistency makes urban governance unpredictable in issuing and amending commercialisation laws.
THE COLLAPSE OF REGULATIONS
The issue of scale plays a critical role in a city such as Karachi, where most of the development takes place under the aegis of the builder mafia, without any Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or structural research and development.
No Objection Certificates (NOCs) have existed since pre-Partition, while EIAs became mandatory in 1994 under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act of 1997. They were designed to ensure sustainable urban development, without causing lethal damage to the ecology. However, they have been reduced to hollow bureaucratic rituals, routinely used to fast-track construction with little oversight.
Belgaumi and urban planner Farhan Anwar deem Karachi’s EIA process as a “bureaucratic formality.” Assessments are typically carried out by builder-hired consultants focused solely on individual plots, ignoring neighbourhood-level impacts. Public hearings are treated as technical requirements rather than spaces for genuine scrutiny. Mitigations are rarely explored, and community feedback is sidelined.
The
Bahria Icon Tower
on the Clifton Promenade is a prominent example of carrying out construction without paying much heed to EIAs and the legal viability of a project — while also endangering heritage sites for its construction.
Endangered heritage sites are often scapegoated for disrupting ecology, but it is powerful developer groups that are reshaping Clifton’s landscape. In Old Clifton, developers, supported by the police, reportedly demolished a heritage bungalow to make way for a high-rise, destroying banyan trees and displacing migratory birds in the process. Due to such constructions, Clifton is now a concrete expanse, commodified at the expense of ecological and cultural memory.
Over 200 high-rises along major arteries, such as Sharae Faisal, were built without proper planning, fire exits or emergency systems. The SBCA issued NOCs and completion certificates without site inspections or consulting the KMC. There are countless such examples.
Hence, EIAs and NOCs are no longer safeguards. They legitimise reckless development and ignore transparency and public accountability. The disastrous impact of this is on display across the city.

ECOLOGICAL DISPARITIES
The ecological toll caused by unregulated high-rise developments is undeniable. Bhai notes the increasing vertical growth in KDA schemes. These areas were never designed for such high density. Consequently, parking needs, unfiltered carbon monoxide and unsanctioned commercial activities worsen residential life.
She also highlights the sewerage outbursts under the Clifton Bridge, which lead to unhygienic living conditions. Residents report that in places such as Gulshan, hot, dust-heavy wind flows in one direction, or not at all, while natural light is blocked due to narrow setbacks and cantilevered floors.
Continuing from Amber Ali Bhai’s argument, urban planners also critique not adhering to zonal planning. The vertical construction is widely critiqued because areas meant for G+1 or G+2 are obliterated by the seepage of high rises into them. Belgaumi furthers this critique by emphasising how high-rise construction has eliminated gardens and permeable surfaces, aggravating flood risks and temperature rises. The risk of flooding across Karachi is on display every year during the monsoon season in the city.
As a result, it is the citizens inhabiting these urban spaces that are forced to contend with the hard realities of living in such localities.
SOCIAL RELATIONS IN URBAN BUILT-ENVIRONMENTS
In densely populated Karachi neighbourhoods such as Gulshan and Hyderi, the wall-to-wall vertical expansion has hindered the natural light and ventilation flow. Residents living in bungalows and on lower floors of high-rises are subject to accumulated heat and lack of air circulation.
Architect and urban planner Arif Hasan describes the absence of fundamental necessities and notes, “Everybody has a right to some fresh air and some light.”
Such eco-spatial limitations then materialise into psychological and physiological concerns, and residents report increased mental strain and respiratory problems. A 2021 survey conducted by the Urban Resource Centre (URC) in Karachi found that nearly 64 percent of respondents living in newer vertical buildings in Gulshan Block 13-D and Hyderi complained of chronic discomfort related to heat and poor air flow.
Using 15 years of satellite imagery, this research mapped the changing landscape of Clifton Block 1 and Gulistan-i-Jauhar in five-year increments. The results reveal an uneven and increasingly stark ratio between green space and high-rise construction, especially in the case of Clifton Block 1.
While Gulistan-i-Jauhar could already be considered dense and a heavily developed neighbourhood in 2010, Clifton Block 1 highlights a sharper trajectory. While green spaces shrink at an alarming pace in both zones, the latter witnesses an aggressive rise in vertical construction, with little thought given to the residents living in its shadows.
The reformation of roads such as Rashid Minhas Road and Bilawal Chowrangi into commercial corridors has not only significantly eradicated green spaces but worsened traffic congestion, noise pollution and water accumulation during the rains.
Over the course of history, zones, including Gulshan-i-Iqbal and Kharadar, were distinguished by their interwoven community living, inclusive of shared alleyways, courtyards and parks that allowed for everyday, informal human interaction. Instead, the proliferation of towering structures and high-rise-living has substituted social engagement with an isolated anonymous lifestyle. The lack of communal spaces has drastically decreased neighbourhood monitoring and reduced social cohesion.
Both the social and ecological ramifications of this kind of construction are resulting in immediate consequences and also more long term issues, and no amount of real-estate projects presented under the garb of ‘sustainability’ can help reverse the damage — instead, they only exacerbate it.
THE GREENWASHING OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT
While Karachi chokes on and drowns in the ecological cost of vertical expansion, a more insidious form of development plays out along its coastline.
Real-estate giants often market projects as sustainable utopias that feature biodiversity parks and oceanfront boardwalks. But this is greenwashing, not conservation. Some are aggressively changing the landscape of Clifton by buying out old historical properties and turning them into vertical dreamscapes. And other developers are developing projects on contested lands. Across
Sindh’s coastal belt
, from Hawke’s Bay to Thatta, Sujawal and Badin, ecological zones once designated for preservation are now being transformed into peri-urban real-estate hubs.
This is happening despite initiatives such as the internationally backed
Delta Blue Carbon project
, which aims to restore mangrove forests and generate carbon credits. Some projects misappropriate the language of climate action, however, without offering genuine environmental benefits. Built on reclaimed tidal lands, they displace mangroves, reduce biodiversity, and fail to contribute to verified carbon offsets.
Gated developments in Korangi Creek and DHA Phase VIII have further narrowed creeks, shrunk fish nurseries and worsened urban flooding. Certain projects at Hawke’s Bay violate environmental laws and erase fisherfolk communities, undermining climate resilience. In a city where EIA systems fail centrally, what chance does Karachi’s fragile coastline have?
Mangroves are among the most carbon-dense ecosystems on earth. Their destruction is not just an ecological loss, it’s a carbon bomb. No amount of rooftop gardens can change that.
MAKING THE CULPRIT PAY
So, as South Asian cities hurtle toward hyper-urbanisation, the question is no longer whether development will continue, but how it can sustain rather than destroy. Karachi’s unregulated vertical growth collides with ecological fragility. Amid this, the Polluter Pays Principle (PPP) offers a path toward accountability.
First introduced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1972 and endorsed at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the PPP has gained new traction at recent UN climate summits as a framework for loss and damage financing. Its logic is simple: those who profit from environmental harm must be financially and legally responsible for mitigation and restoration.
At the 27th Conference of the Parties (
COP27
), then-climate change minister Sherry Rehman championed climate justice and the operationalisation of PPP. But this commitment remains largely rhetorical at home. Pakistan demands justice globally but falls short in regulating local polluters, especially in booming sectors such as construction.
Cement, for instance, accounts for approximately eight percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. Karachi developers must shift to low-carbon alternatives such as green cement, and the SBCA must enforce this shift, particularly for high-volume projects.
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification offers another pathway. While optional globally, SBCA could mandate a Karachi-specific version, requiring just one to two percent of project budgets for green roofs or solar panels. This small investment brings huge environmental returns.
In a region where the urban poor suffer from climate change the most, the PPP isn’t just policy — it’s a means for justice. If Karachi is to grow upwards, it must also grow responsibly, ensuring that those who profit also protect.
SAVING THE CITY FROM ITSELF
Karachi has evolved into a metropolis that is increasingly hostile to its own residents, where floods, heat and congestion are not natural inevitabilities but man-made crises. To help reverse this tide, Karachi’s development paradigm must shift. This means, among other things, reviving long-neglected master planning processes with genuine community participation, holding polluters accountable and embedding environmental safeguards in real-estate projects.
The illusion of progress in Karachi cannot only be measured by skylines. Instead valuing breathable air, accessible green spaces and social cohesion must be seen as markers of true urban prosperity. Without such a recalibration, the city risks drowning further — not only in rainwater, but in its own failures of imagination.

continued closure
of the border between Iran and Pakistan despite a resolution passed by the provincial assembly a few days ago demanding re-opening of the border by Pakistan with Iran.
Soon after the assembly session began on Friday, National Party MPA Rehmat Saleh Baloch stood on a point of order and pointed out that the border with Iran was still closed despite demand of the provincial assembly lawmakers and adoption of a resolution by the assembly in this connection a few days ago.
He said that Balochistan is facing both insecurity and massive and rising unemployment due to the closure of the border trade with Iran. “The closure of the Pakistan border with Iran has forced 45,000 families into starvation. Border trade has been taking place since 1957. Until the Iran border is reopened, we, the elected members from border areas, will stage token walkouts,” he declared.
JUI lawmaker Mir Zabid Ali Reki, who belongs to Mashkel, stated that if the government insists on keeping the border closed, it must provide alternatives. He also warned that if the border is not reopened, the opposition lawmakers would not allow the assembly to function. JUI’s Ghulam Dastagir Badini also demanded that the federal and provincial governments give border trade a legal cover.
Speaker of the Balochistan Assembly, Capt retired Abdul Khaliq Khan Achakzai, said that a proper taxation system exists in Chaman and asked whether it should be extended to other border crossings also.
After the speeches, border area lawmakers staged a walkout in protest over the continued closure of border trade. Later, the Speaker ruled that Minister Saleem Khosa should meet the chief minister to discuss the issue and after that a committee should be formed to discuss the problem with the prime minister.  After the speaker’s ruling, the protesting lawmakers ended their walkout and rejoined the assembly session.

Messages from political leadership
In
separate messages
ahead of Sept 6, PM Shehbaz and President Zardari reaffirmed the nation’s commitment to safeguarding its sovereignty, countering external threats, and building a united, prosperous future.
They also recalled the 1965 War with India, noting that Pakistan’s valiant armed forces, with the full support of the people, had thwarted enemy aggression, proving that the country possesses the will and capacity to defend its independence and integrity.
Highlighting the recent
Oper­ation Bunyanum Marsoos
,
Marka-i-Haq
, PM Shehbaz lauded the Pakistan Army, Navy, and Air Force for their unmatched professionalism and combat skills under the strategic leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to peace and constructive international engagement but war­ned against ignoring the reality of continuous Indian provocations and shifting regional dynamics.
Expressing solidarity with the oppressed people of occupied Kashmir, the prime minister reiterated unwavering support for their struggle for self-determination, stressing that it cannot be suppressed by force.
He also strongly condemned ongoing Israeli aggression in Palestine and urged the international community to ensure the protection of civilians and uninterrupted humanitarian aid to Gaza.
In a separate message posted on X today, the premier said Pakistan’s policy of peaceful coexistence and constructive engagement with the world, as well as the nation’s commitment to strengthening and modernising defence capabilities.
He asserted that Pakistan remained committed to the policy of peaceful coexistence and constructive engagement with the world.
“Yet, we cannot be oblivious to the reality of persistent Indian provocations and the changing regional environment. We shall continue to strengthen and modernise our defence capabilities, while also confronting the twin menace of state-sponsored terrorism and foreign proxies operating within our borders,” he added.
Earlier, President Zardari, in his message, paid tribute to the valiant sacrifices of the nation’s armed forces and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to its defence and sovereignty.
He described September 6 as a glorious chapter in the country’s history and emphasised that the spirit of sacrifice from the 1965 War continued to serve as a guiding light for future generations.
The president highlighted the significance of this year’s Defence Day in light of the recent Operation Bunyanum Marsoos conducted in May 2025 against India.
“Just as our courageous forces demonstrated extraordinary valour and dedication in 1965, our sons once again proved their unmatched bravery during this year’s operation,” he said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that Sept 6 was a “historic day of courage and bravery, when the martyrs, the veterans and the nation together made Pakistan invincible”.
Naqvi said that from Kasur to Lahore and from Sialkot to Kashmir, the Pakistan Army had given a “befitting response to the enemy at every front with unmatched courage and unwavering resolve”.
He underscored that Sept 6 was the renewal of the pledge that the country’s sanctity would never be compromised.
In his message today, PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari posted on X that on Defence Day, “we honour our martyrs, their families, our
ghazis

The orphan girl, Ayesha Bibi, was allegedly abducted by an armed group from a house in Baghbana Hassan Zai on Sept 23. Her relatives claim the kidnapping was done at the behest of influential tribal figures.
Ayesha Bibi, whose parents are deceased, had been living with relatives. The family described themselves as poor and vulnerable, with no way to counter the influence of local power holders.
“Our girl is innocent. She was taken from our home at night, and we have no means to secure her rel­ease,” family elder Maulvi Rehmatullah Zeh­ri said at a press conference.
Zehri accused local officials of obstructing their efforts for justice, claiming the family identified the alleged culprits and their locations to law enforcement.
“But instead of helping us, the Assistant Commis­sioner of Khuzdar threatened us and asked us to remain silent,” Mr Zehri said. “This is sheer injustice—our family has been destroyed.”
He further alleged that powerful local elements are shielding the perpetrators.
“We are poor people with neither resources nor influence,” they said in a joint statement. “Since the abduction, our women and children live in constant fear and sleepless nights. We informed the authorities, but instead of taking action, they are trying to suppress us.”

concerns
over interference in judicial affairs, expressed solidarity with Justice Tariq Meh­mo­­od Jahangiri, and called for appo­i­ntment of an independent Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
A convention of lawyers, atten­ded by veteran figures such as Aitzaz Ahsan, Sardar Latif Khan Khosa, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, and others, adopted a resolution outlining their stance on judicial independence, constitutional supremacy, and political accountability.
The resolution declared that the legal fraternity firmly stood with Justice Jahangiri, who was rece­n­tly
restrained
from exercising ju­­dicial functions by a bench headed by Chief Justice Sardar Moham­mad Sarfraz Dogar.
The lawyers termed the restriction without lawful backing, noting that the very
elevation
of Justice Dogar as the chief justice was still under judicial review.
Reading out the resolution, Mr Khosa said that the proper constitutional forum to examine the conduct of judges was the Supreme Judicial Council and not the administrative orders or benches constituted without due process.
“Judicial independence cannot be compromised through extra-constitutional means,” the veteran lawyer remarked, adding that side­­lining Justice Jahangiri amou­nted to undermining the judiciary’s credibility.
The lawyers also voiced strong support for the five IHC judges who had submitted a petition highlig­hting undue influence in the internal functioning of the high court.
The lawyers’ resolution questioned the legitimacy of Chief Election Commis­sioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja’s continued stay in the office. They argued that his statutory term expired in January, yet the CEC remained in position. The resolution said that such an act is unconstitutional and tantamount to treason. They underscored that the Constitution guarantees fundamental rights.

alleged that “Pakistani authorities have continued to unlawfully surveil the country’s citizens, including regular citizens, journalists, as well as prominent politicians.”
The rights watchdog stated that Pakistani authorities allegedly “use the
Lawful Intercept Management System
(LIMS) to surveil a significant portion of the population’s digital activity through Pakistani telecommunications providers.”
The number of phones under surveillance could be higher as all four major mobile operators have been ordered to connect to LIMS, Amnesty technologist Jurre van Berge told
Reuters.
The report, citing the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), said that telecommunications providers were “under an obligation to ensure that up to two per cent of their entire consumer base can be surveilled.“
Authorities also employ a firewall known as WMS 2.0 that inspects internet traffic and can block two million active sessions at a time, Amnesty alleged, further enhancing the system of surveillance.
LIMS is a product sold by a German company called Ultimaco, which “allows for the classification of internet traffic and mobile communications such as text messaging and voice and [stores] this data for authorities to go through”.
The technology has been in use in Pakistan since 2007.
According to its findings, “Utimaco’s LIMS allows the authorities to sift through the telecommunications provider subscriber data”.
Using the LIMS system, the authorities only need a person’s phone number, the report said.
The report went on to explain that this data is then “made accessible through a Monitoring Centre Next Generation (McNG)”.
According to the report, “McNG is a product by Datafusion, formerly Trovicor, which allows authorities to sift through the material collected by LIMS.” Using the McNG system, “operators can see [who has] been calling whom, when this happened, what websites were browsed, if someone might’ve used WhatsApp or a VPN and their location”.
The report attributed the unchecked deployment of mass surveillance to a lack of technical and legal safeguards.
Amnesty recalled that the workings of the LIMS system came to light in the case of Bushra Bibi vs Federation of Pakistan, filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC), after “a series of prominent cases of interception and leaking of audio recordings of calls between politicians and public figures became public” between 2022 and 2023.
The case was filed to “investigate these recordings and the legality of interception of telecoms”.
As a result, it was disclosed that the PTA had issued directions to telecom licensees to “finance, import and install LIMS at a designated place for the use of designated agencies“, the report said.
In its assessment, the amnesty added that the use of technology to curb freedom and the right to privacy contributes to a “chilling effect and a shrinking of civic space in the country”.
Calling for safeguards to protect citizens’ data, the rights body pointed out that Pakistan’s current data systems were highly centralised, leaving citizens vulnerable to such surveillance.
It cautioned that the “scope of this surveillance and its interconnectedness is expected to increase with the enactment of the Digital Nation Pakistan Act 2025”.
The
Digital Nation Pakistan Act 2025
aims to create a digital identity for citizens, to centralise social, economic, and governance data.
Internet censorship, shutdowns
According to the report, the mass surveillance in Pakistan works in conjunction with frequent internet censorship, made possible via the use of the Web Monitoring System (WMS). “Internet censorship involves blocking specific content on the internet, slowing down and controlling internet speeds, or shutting down the internet altogether,” it said.
The watchdog noted that the first iteration of the WMS was installed in Pakistan in 2018 by a company called Sandvine; however, according to Amnesty’s investigation, the previous WMS was replaced by a more advanced system produced by a Chinese company, Geedge Networks.
Amnesty went on to say that the new technology was a commercialised version of China’s “Great Firewall”, which is a censorship tool used by the Chinese government.
The installation of the system was ensured with the help of various foreign companies, including US-based Niagara Networks, French company Thales, and Chinese company New H3C Technologies, it said.
Furthermore, the report mentioned that the PTA had “blocked more than 1.4 million URLs since the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) was passed in 2016”.
The rights watchdog noted that the process of blocking and removing content has always been “marked by opacity and arbitrariness”.
It said that the users were “rarely provided any notice by the PTA” before the blocking of content, and became aware of it only when they were unable to access the said content.
Regarding internet shutdowns, Amnesty noted that “the pattern of shutting down mobile and internet services in the name of maintaining law and order has become a regular occurrence”.
Citing a
report
by the ‘Keep it On’ coalition, Amnesty said that between 2016 and 2024, Pakistan experienced at least 77 internet shutdown incidents, with 24 of these in 2024 alone.
These included selective blocking of specific sites or content, and “bandwidth throttling” especially in the time leading up to the 2024 general elections, as well as during virtual rallies held by the PTI.
Citing data from the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), Amnesty showcased that “just before the general election on 8 February 2024, OONI measurements confirm that several websites were blocked, including the opposition PTI party website and the PTI candidates’ website, as well as
Fact Focus
, an investigative news outlet”.
Amnesty said that “this shows that the new firewall is being used effectively by Pakistani telecommunications providers to actively block crucial communication channels.”
Recalling the recent internet shutdown in Balochistan and similar incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Amnesty highlighted that “these shutdowns are often used to disrupt protests and political rallies”.
As per Amnesty’s assessment, the four companies named in the report — Geedge Networks, Utimaco, Datafusion and Niagara Networks — allegedly “contributed to human rights abuse in Pakistan by facilitating mass surveillance”.
“Mass surveillance and unlawful censorship by the Pakistani authorities represent systemic abuses of fundamental human rights,” the rights body said.
Amnesty called for “urgent action” to prevent any further harm, stressing that the “unchecked digital repression” will limit space for democracy.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944743/separating-fact-from-fiction-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-hpv-vaccine,Separating fact from fiction: What you need to know about the HPV vaccine - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"As Pakistan introduces the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccine to its routine immunisation programme and is running the
first vaccination campaign
from September 15 to 27 in Punjab, Sindh, Islamabad and AJK, the media is rife with all kinds of rumours and elaborate conspiracy theories.
Summarily, the HPV vaccine is administered to
prevent
certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which can lead to cancers such as cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and head and neck cancers, as well as pre-cancerous lesions. An
Aga Khan University study estimates
that over 80% of sexually active people will acquire HPV at some point in their life.
But even as the vaccine is rolled out to mitigate the spread of the virus, it is the mix of dis- and mis-information by so-called social media ‘influencers’, irresponsible politicians and an ill-informed and ultra-conservative religious lot, which is both distressing and annoying.
Below are some frequently asked questions about the vaccine, and brief answers that may clarify some of these myths.
What is the status of the vaccine in other countries?
Pakistan is now among around 150 countries — around 76 per cent of the UN member states — that recommend the HPV Vaccine. The majority of these countries have included the vaccine in their routine national vaccine programmes.
With the exception of Afghanistan, Pakistan is the last country in South Asia to introduce the routine HPV vaccination programme, and so is the case in the Muslim world.
All major Muslim-majority countries have already taken this step.
Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country in the world, started introducing the vaccine in 2016, established a National Cervical Cancer Elimination Plan in 2023 and is now locally producing the vaccine. In Iran, the vaccine was made available for personal use two decades ago, and in May 2025, Iran started producing two versions of the HPV vaccine.
Is cervical cancer a major health problem in Pakistan?
More than 95pc of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases occurring globally each year are caused by HPV. Every two minutes, a woman dies from this preventable disease globally, and 90pc of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.
According to official data, around 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed every year in Pakistan, out of which 3,200 affect women, resulting in 64pc deaths. The detection of pre-cancer stage or cancer requires regular screening among women of reproductive age through the Pap test and the specific HPV test.
Since such screening for various reasons does not take place in Pakistan, nor do we maintain a national cancer registry, we don’t know the actual number of cases and deaths. Globally, and in Pakistan, cervical cancer is among the top cancers affecting women.
What is cervical cancer and what causes it?
The cervix is an anatomical part between the vagina and uterus which connects them. HPV can cause sexually transmitted infections which can result in the development of precancerous lesions or warts on the inner surface of the cervix.
This was discovered by Dr Hérald zur Hausen, a German virologist, who won the Nobel Prize in 2008 for his important research. It proved that certain strains of HPV (namely HPV 16 and 18) could eventually cause cervical cancer, which led to the development of the HPV vaccine.
The interval between the acquisition of HPV infection and progression to invasive carcinoma is usually 15–20 years or longer.
Most HPV infections remain asymptomatic, but once cancer develops, there will be unusual bleeding and discharge. There may also be persistent lower abdominal pain and weight loss.
How much does this vaccine protect against cervical cancer?
Scientific evidence shows that this vaccine provides 90pc protection against developing cervical cancer if the injection is provided to young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 years. In relative terms, this is a very high level of protection.
Is it right for Pakistan govt to include HPV vaccine in its national programme?
Absolutely yes! From a public health standpoint, it may not be the most important and common health issue being faced by women in Pakistan, but since we don’t know the exact extent of it and since we have a vaccine that can prevent this cancer, so, why not protect our women against this scourge?
Other key health issues of women in Pakistan, like anaemia, maternal mortality, and breast cancer, must also be attended to as a priority. In 2020, 194 member states of the World Health Organisation, including Pakistan, launched a global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem.
One important element of this strategy is to prevent cancer by immunising young girls.
Why young girls? Because the vaccine is most effective when given just before or at the start of the sexual and reproductive life of the girl.
Is HPV vaccine safe?
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the HPV vaccine, Gardasil 4 by Merck, in 2006. Since then, the WHO Prequalification Programme has approved at least five different HPV vaccines, including single-dose vaccines for their safety, quality and efficacy. There are hardly any side effects, and if at all, these are very minor and rare.
Which vaccine is exactly being used in Pakistan?
The Pakistan Federal Directorate of Immunisation is using the HPV vaccine called Cecolin. It is manufactured in China and is supplied through Gavi — the global vaccine alliance. It is a
single-dose vaccine.
WHO prequalified this vaccine in October 2024 for its quality, safety and efficacy and the decision was made based on new data on the product that fulfilled the criteria set out in WHO’s 2022 recommendations for alternative, off-label use of HPV vaccines in single-dose schedules.
Research has shown that the single-dose vaccine is not inferior to the double-dose one in terms of providing immunity. The single-dose vaccine will, however, contribute to improving a more sustainable supply of HPV vaccines, allowing more girls to be reached.
Previously, HPV vaccine introductions have been hampered by global supply shortages.
Who is financing the HPV vaccine supply, globally and in Pakistan?
Donors globally have committed nearly $600 million towards the elimination of cervical cancer. Funding includes $180m from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, $10m from Unicef, and $400m from the World Bank.
In Pakistan, currently, 95pc of the vaccine delivery is financed by global sources through Gavi and five per cent of the funds are provided by the government. This is a standard mechanism. In due course of time, however, Pakistan has to foot the full bill from domestic sources.",2025-09-27,Zafar Mirza,1668,0.000185

CRACKDOWN: The police on Monday launched a crackdown on the non-custom paid (NCP) vehicles, which have not been profiled/registered with the excise department in Bajaur.
A statement issued from the district police office said the action was launched after profiling of NCP vehicles was deemed necessary due to the prevailing law and order situation in the district.
“Following the directives from senior officials, the district police have initiated a major crackdown on non-profiled NCP vehicles, requiring owners to register them immediately in view of the prevailing law and order situation,” the statement said.
It said though residents have frequently been urged to get their vehicles profiled amid the current law and order situation, most have failed to comply, prompting the police to launch the crackdown. During the crackdown, several NCP vehicles were impounded. The statement asked the residents to get their NCP vehicles profiled with the excise department office without delay to avoid action.
“Profiling of such vehicles is not only a legal requirement but also crucial for the safety and security of the local community,” the statement added. A source in the local police told
Dawn
on Monday that around half of the total NCP vehicles in the district were reportedly not profiled.
The source, however, mentioned that a large number of residents had got their vehicles registered/profiled.
The profiling process was launched by the district administration on October 24, 2023.

Mr Chaudhry has been asked to report to the NCCIA headquarters, Islamabad. He said he was transferred to the headquarters and he had sought a six-month leave.
“The task I had taken up will be met by my successor. However, to those involved in trolling me on social media, I will respond at an appropriate time,” he said.
Three controversies surrounded Mr Chaudhry of late — one regarding laying hands on a number of YouTubers/social media influencers, including Saadur Rehman, popularly known as
Ducky Bhai
and
Rajab Butt
, for their alleged involvement in unregulated online trading and
online gambling apps
.
The other is registration of an FIR against some lawyers who allegedly tried to get a suspect released from the NCCIA.
A lawyer in question has claimed that the suspect was detained illegally and a court-appointed bailiff had visited the NCCIA, Lahore, for his release. The third controversy is related to the tiff between a group of Lahore’s journalists and a serving DIG and some other police officials as the former moved the NCCIA to act against the latter.
According to an official, Mr Chaudhry had been transferred in light of different complaints against him.
Meanwhile, the NCCIA arrested seven suspects for online financial fraud.
An NCCIA team conducted a raid in Silanwali, Sargodha, and arrested suspects Muhammad Imran, Muhammad Yaseen, Muhammad Suleman, Naseem Akhter, Shahbaz Ali, Suleman James and Abdul Aziz. Electronic devices recovered from their possession contained multiple pieces of evidence of financial fraud.
The suspects posed as representatives of a foreign company and looted millions of rupees in the name of crypto and online investment, it said.
According to investigations, large sums of money were collected from victims through various bank accounts and mobile numbers. The suspects trapped citizens using fake WhatsApp numbers, international contacts, and advertisements.
The case has been registered against the suspects under sections 13, 14, and 16 of the Peca Act, and sections 419, 420, 468, 471, and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Mines and Mineral Act
approved by the provincial assembly, but challenged by some political parties in court.
The act has been
challenged
in the Balochistan High Court by several former leaders, political parties, and lawyers who argue it violates the rights of the people of Balochistan and undermines the province’s control over its natural resources.
The constitutional petitions contend that the act was passed without proper consultation and centralises control over mineral resources, potentially leading to the displacement of locals. The court is jointly hearing all petitions and has issued notices to the federal and provincial governments.
Speaking on the floor of the house during the Balochistan Assembly session, the chief minister said that when the Mines and Mineral Act was introduced in the house “we tried to develop consensus on the issue and succeeded in achieving that”.
However, he said, some political parties, including those having no representation in the parliament, have challenged the act in the court.  “I talked to leaders of political parties and told them the government is ready to hold talks to resolve the issue through talks instead of taking the matter to the court.
“It is an issue of the parliament and it should be resolved in the parliament through dialogue instead of it being decided at some other place,” Mr Bugti said, adding that “if someone wants to form a committee on it, we are ready as the issue could be resolved through dialogue and joint efforts”.
“Political parties who approached the court of law should come with their suggestions and sit with officials of the mines and minerals department and representatives of the government to discuss and improve the act,” Mr Bugti said, adding that by removing objections on the act, “we can get the act approved with consensus in the house”.
Opposition leader in the Assembly Mir Younis Aziz Zehri welcomed the offer and said he would talk to leaders of opposition parties on the offer of Mr Bugti.
Speaking on the issue in the house, Minister for Mines and Mineral Mir Shoaib Nosherwani said he has sent suggestions of Mines and Mineral Association representatives on the issue to the chief minister.

US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize because “he helped save the region from destruction” during a period of Pakistan-India escalation.
The Pakistani government in June had decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” to end the India-Pakistan
escalation
in May. The conflict began after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the April 22

attack in occupied Kashmir, launched airstrikes in Pakistan, and faced
retaliation

prevented
a “bad nuclear war” between the two nations.
Responding to a reporter’s question about Pakistan nominating Trump for the Nobel Prize during a press conference in London today, the PM said, “Mr Trump eased tension between Pakistan and India and has saved the region from major destruction.”
He emphasised that if Trump had not intervened in the Pakistan-India escalation, “there would be more destruction and loss of lives.”
The premier added that Trump has eased tension between Ethiopia and Egypt, and even in Ukraine.”
‘Washington visit very fruitful’
Speaking about his recent meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly, PM Shehbaz said that his visit to Washington “was very fruitful; it was very successful.”
He said the best thing that happened was that in the UN building, President Trump co-chaired a
meeting
on Gaza, and he invited Pakistan, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia.
“There, a very constructive discussion took place, and as a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire,” he said.
“Since 2023 in Gaza, the market of oppression and tyranny has been heated, and innocent Muslims are being martyred, including children, mothers, sisters, and youngsters. I believe that this much cruelty and intensity has rarely been witnessed in modern times, and for that, alhamdulillah, we have raised a strong voice at the UN and expressed complete solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters.”
Conflict with India
PM Shehbaz said that during his meeting with Trump, he also talked about the escalation with India, and how New Delhi
weaponised the Indus Waters Treaty
against the people of Pakistan.
“[I talked about] the way our forces defeated India and, by the grace of Almighty Allah, made India learn a lesson which they will remember for a lifetime,” he said.
“I also said that Pakistan won the war, by the grace of God, through our brave armed forces, who fought with great courage and outstanding professional equipment, led by Field Marshal Saeed Asim Munir, who led from the front and whose resolve was unwavering, and the entire nation was behind our own forces.
“And our air forces, led by Air Marshal Zaheer Babar and his brave fighters, made a strong defence. The world came to realise that not only is Pakistan a nuclear power, but purely meant for our defence. And now the purpose: Pakistan is also very accomplished in traditional warfare, conservative warfare.”

In addition, the police have also sought land for five more stations.
Sources in the police told
Dawn
that in a recent meeting, the Interior Ministry asked the CDA to provide plots for police stations that were either built on green belts, operating in rented buildings, located outside their jurisdiction, or functioning from within other police stations’ premises.
The meeting was attended by senior officials of the ministry, CDA and police, including Inspector General of Police (IGP) Islamabad Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi. A decision was taken to shift police stations from green belts, rented buildings, out-of-jurisdiction areas, and shared facilities.
Islamabad police seek more land for another five police stations
In response, the CDA sought time from the interior ministry after being directed to allocate suitable plots for police stations within days.
The police requested that the land be allotted within their respective jurisdictions, in easily accessible locations along main roads. They emphasised that police movement and the mobility of police vehicles should be unhindered.
Separate police teams were formed to survey the city and identify suitable land for police stations. On the recommendations of these teams, sites were proposed to the CDA for allocation.
According to police sources, the buildings of Koral, Kirpa, Khanna, Humak and Banigala police stations are located on green belts. Shamas Colony police station operates from a rented building, while Phulgran police station functions from within the Barakahu police station.
Nilore and Lohibher police stations are housed in old choki buildings, while Sangjani station is operating under makeshift arrangements along the N-5.
So far, the CDA has allotted land for Phulgran, Sangjani, Banigala, Shams Colony and Nilore police stations. Land for Phulgran has been allocated at Green Enclave-I, Sangjani at N-5, Banigala at Margalla Enclave, Shams Colony at I-12 Markaz, and Nilore at Lethrar Road.
Police teams also surveyed sites for Khanna, Kirpa, Koral, Humak and Lohibher police stations, later proposing land to the CDA. They requested land for Khanna at Rehman Enclave, Kirpa at Gulberg Residencies, Koral at Gulberg Green and Lohibher at Capital Enclave.
The CDA will construct the new police stations for the capital police.
The authority has also invited electronic bids for the construction of Humak, Lohibher, Kirpa, Nilore, Koral, Shams Colony, Sangjani and Phulgran police stations. A sum of Rs95.196 million has been reserved for the construction of each station.
Meanwhile, construction of the Golra and Women’s police stations is already underway. The Golra station is being built within the premises of the existing facility, while the Women police station is being constructed in G-7 Markaz, near the old building.
Renovation work has also begun at Aabpara, Margalla, Tarnol, Shalimar, Sumbal, Kohsar, Karachi Company, Ramna, Secretariat, Noon, Sabzi Mandi, Sihala, Barakahu and Shahzad Town police stations.
AIG Logistics, SSP Law and Order, SSP Operations, SP City, SP Dolphin and Patrolling, SP Saddar, SP Security and Discipline, SP I Area, SP Soan and SP Rural have been appointed to monitor the quality and progress of both the renovation and construction work.

Even upmarket areas like Defence Housing Authority and Clifton weren’t spared, with residents experiencing prolonged power outages lasting several hours.
However, KE spokesperson Imran Rana claimed that the power transmission system was stable, and uninterrupted power supply was being provided through over 1,910 feeders out of 2,100 in the city.
KE admits tripping of around 200 feeders, claims supply disconnected in low-lying areas as safety measure
“At the peak of the rainfall, less than 200 feeders saw temporary outages. As per safety protocols, supply has been disconnected in low-lying areas, and power is being restored as soon as rainwater is drained and safety clearance is received from ground teams,” he added.
He stressed on the importance of adhering to safety protocols. “We strongly urge citizens to maintain safe distance from electrical infrastructure during rains including poles, electricity meters, service brackets, broken and tangled internet/cable wires. Internal wiring and water motors should not be operated with wet hands or in standing water. Only certified electricians should be engaged in case of electrical faults within households,” he added.
Residents in DHA Phase I without power for three days

Besides losing electricity for extended hours during the night, the residents of 7th East Street in DHA Phase 1 have also had to endure voltage fluctuations, which have resulted in ruining their electrical appliances. They described their plight as a “nightmare, which is affecting children, adults, working professionals and the elderly”.
The residents also informed that their power supply is cut after midnight (mostly around 2:30am) for four hours every night. These blackouts started as phase fluctuations during May and June but from July onwards have upgraded to complete blackouts.
The residents said that they have been complaining every day to K-Electric about the issue to which the standard response is that they are experiencing a “technical fault”.
“Each day KE dispatches its team to solve the issue but the problem persists,” said a resident.
“We have been reliably informed that the root of the problem are kundas that have been installed by residents from Azam Basti with help of locals. It is also rumoured that KE insiders are complicit in this disruption and we sincerely hope that is not the case but these thoughts are the result of selective outages at unreasonable hours daily for the so many months,” another resident added.
Reminding that they are loadshedding exempt areas where people pay all their bills in time without fail every month, the residents urged the KE to investigate the problem and resolve the matter urgently.

• One each created for Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Mirpurkhas and Benazirabad
KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) has abolished 10 anti-terrorism courts (ATCs) in the province and converted them into anti-narcotics courts to decide an alarmingly high number of drug cases.
In September 2024, the provincial assembly passed the Sindh Control of Narcotics Substance (CNS) Act by repealing the federal law (CNS Act of 1997) to the extent of the province.
In May this year, the SHC
directed
the provincial government to immediately establish special CNS courts across the province after it was informed that the special courts to try such offences under the 2024 law had not yet been established despite having exclusive jurisdiction to try such offences.
In July, the home department approached the SHC for the re-designation of ATCs into CNS courts.
The SHC has abolished 10 ATCs, including eight in Karachi and one each in Hyderabad and Sukkur, and re-designated them in a manner that created five CNS courts for Karachi division and one CNS court each for the five divisional headquarters.
According to a communication made to the secretary of the home department on behalf of the SHC registrar, the department, through the registrar ATCs had sent a letter to the SHC on the subject matter.
“The honorable chief justice has been pleased to accord conditional concurrence, for time being, to abolition of 10 antiterrorism courts (eight in Karachi, one in Hyderabad and Sukkur each) and re-designation in the following manner, and creation of 5 CNS courts for Karachi and 1 CNS court for each divisional headquarter i.e. Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur, Shaheed Benazirabad and Larkana”, it added.
The letter also stated that ATC-I, II, III, VI, VII, IX, X and XIV in Karachi, ATC-III in Hyderabad and ATC-II located at Central Prison in Sukkur had been abolished and re-designated as provincial CNS courts.
After such conversion, the provincial metropolis will have 12 ATCs, whereas two in Hyderabad and one in Sukkur. Eight of the 10 ATCs in Karachi converted into CNS courts had long remained vacant.
Initially, three ATCs were set up in Karachi after the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, and two more ATCs were later established in the provincial metropolis. Subsequently, ATC-IV and V were shifted to Larkana and Badin.
In 2014, seven new ATCs were set up in the city, and 10 more were established during the Karachi operation in 2016.
SHC moved for recovery of two ‘missing’ MQM-L leaders
The Sindh High Court was moved on Wednesday for recovery of two Muttahida Qaumi Movement-London leaders, including a former lawmaker, who have reportedly gone missing.
Citing the ministry of interior, director general of Rangers Sindh, provincial police chief and others as respondents, petitioner Hassan Nisar contended that his father Nisar Panhwar along with his friend Anwar Tareen had been picked up on Sept 16 by the law enforcement agencies and since then their whereabouts were unknown.
He asserted that his father had been a victim of enforced disappearances on multiple occasions by law enforcement agencies and it was the fourth such incident highlighting a pattern of illegal abductions targeting political dissidents.
The petitioner further maintained that Mr Panhwar had served as a Member of the National Assembly from 2003 to 2007 and Provincial Assembly of Sindh from 2008 to 2013.
He argued that his father was an elderly individual and was known to be suffering from diabetes, which required consistent and specialised care while the petitioner had approached the police to locate the whereabouts of his father, but to no avail.
He asked the SHC to direct the respondents to make sincere efforts in order to trace the whereabouts of both missing persons.

altercation
between them.
On Thursday, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had issued condemnatory statements and
called for the judge’s dismissal
from the post of the IHC top judge.
In a post on X today, the lawyer, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, said she had filed a complaint against the judge before the IHC’s workplace harassment committee and a reference for misconduct before the SJC.
The complaint, a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
, was filed under Section 4 (procedure for holding inquiry) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010.
A circular issued later in the day read that Justices Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz would be members of the inquiry committee that would investigate harassment complaints against fellow IHC judges.
A later notification from the IHC registrar said Justice Dogar nominated Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas as the competent authority under the act, replacing Justice Imtiaz who was appointed to the role in July. Justice Minhas took his oath as an IHC judge in January.
As per the 2010 act, the inquiry committee conducts the investigation into the harassment allegations and then forwards it to the competent authority for final determination and application.
The complaint requested the IHC inquiry committee to initiate an investigation.
It further pleaded the committee to declare she was “subjected to sexist, discriminatory, hostile, threatening, intimidating and unreasonable behaviour at the hands of the respondent chief justice” and declare that Justice Dogar was “guilty of harassing the complainant and consequently issue appropriate recommendations to the competent authority (i.e. SJC) against the respondent as envisaged under Section 4(4) of the 2010 act”.
It also requested the committee to grant any other relief “deemed fair and reasonable in the circumstances” in her favour.
The complaint said that the judge had engaged in an “unprovoked and unnecessary tirade” against her during last week’s proceedings.
“Even after the incident, the complainant felt insulted, humiliated and degraded as a result of the respondent chief justice’s brazen abuse of authority. The sentiment was shared by the complainant’s husband and lawyer colleagues who were present in the courtroom and witnessed the exchange. A collective sense of disbelief and anger was expressed at the unprecedented scenes.
“Unfortunately, while the respondent chief justice had earlier made clear to the complainant that he held a personal grudge/bias against her (as reflected in his conduct and remarks in multiple cases fixed before him), his conduct on September 11 crossed all limits of decency,” the complaint said, adding that in an earlier case involving journalist Asad Ali Toor on August 12, “the respondent chief justice had passed inappropriate and personal remarks towards the complainant, including: ‘Why are you so stubborn?’ Journalists and court reporters, along with the complainant’s husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, were witnesses to the same.”
The complaint said last week’s incident was a “part of the broader pattern of intimidation and degrading treatment meted out to the complainant at the hands of the respondent chief justice, in complete abuse of his position of authority. The respondent chief justice has repeatedly, in courtrooms full of litigants, lawyers, court staff and police officials, aggressively (and often in a vulgar manner) asserted his power (which he is meant to exercise as a trust for the people of Pakistan, not to assert his personal fiefdom)”.
It further said that “apart from the fact that this conduct is completely unbecoming of a judge, the complainant was clearly subjected to a hostile, degrading and threatening work environment by the respondent chief justice, in whose court she was required to appear before for her client. The treatment meted out to the complainant was in full public view, and the complainant’s husband and lawyer colleagues”.
The complaint pointed out to the public condemnation and criticism in the wake of the “sexist, discriminatory and threatening remarks”, referring to the statements from various lawyer associations.
It added that instead of “acknowledging and apologising for his threatening, sexist and intimidating conduct, the respondent chief justice once again made further sexist remarks against the complainant, in her absence, in his courtroom, in an entirely unconnected case, the very next day on Sept 12 … The respondent chief justice continued to abuse his authority/position in once again threatening the complainant in her absence that he would initiate contempt of court proceedings against her, whilst also stating that he did not want to ruin her career and attempting to ridicule her by calling her a ‘child’ in a courtroom full of people, when the complainant is a well-respected lawyer in the community”.
The complaint read that the “sexist comments taken together with repeated threats of ‘contempt of court’ and ‘not wanting to destroy’ the ‘female child’s career’ are not only appalling but shocking coming from someone holding the office of chief justice of a constitutional court, meant to uphold the fundamental rights of all citizens”.
It argued that the judge’s conduct, “apart from being clear misconduct — also falls within the ambit of workplace harassment. Not only did the respondent chief justice make clear his views on women in open court but he also abused his position of authority to harass, intimidate, threaten and humiliate the complainant in a place where she is required to appear every day by virtue of her job/profession as a lawyer”.
It said the chief justice’s conduct fell within the definition of “harassment” in the 2010 act.
“The respondent chief justice’s conduct on Sept 11 and 12 constitutes ‘verbal communication’ of a ‘sexually demeaning attitude’ and ‘derogatory’ expression that caused ‘interference with work performance’ and also created ‘an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment’. Further, the sexist, discriminatory and threatening conduct of the respondent chief justice also constitutes ‘discrimination on the basis of gender’ which does not necessarily have to be ‘sexual in nature’ but which ‘may embody a discriminatory and prejudicial mind set or notion, resulting in discriminatory behaviour’,” the complaint argued.
It added that Mazari was “made to feel extremely uncomfortable in her workplace and was at the receiving end of hostile, threatening and sexist language used against her by the respondent chief justice in an open court” in the presence of lawyers, police officials, journalists and litigants.
The complaint said the “power balance” between the two parties was also “evident”.
“The continued abuse of authority by the respondent chief justice has clearly been fuelled by the power imbalance between the parties, which led to his further misogynist statements/remarks on Sept 12, in the absence of the complainant,” it added.
The complaint said the Thursday incident was a “glimpse of the respondent chief justice’s opinions on women, particularly how he views them as possessions of husbands, to be controlled and reigned in when he feels they are overstepping their gender roles.
“The respondent chief justice’s conduct is the clearest possible manifestation of a patriarchal mindset, which cannot be tolerated, especially in the superior judiciary which is meant to safeguard citizens’ constitutional rights, including the right to basic human dignity. The conduct of the respondent chief justice on Sept 12 was yet another manifestation of his patriarchal mindset … once again attempting to humiliate and demean her in a professional setting where she is required to appear every day”.
Separately, a district and sessions court summoned Mazari and her husband on Wednesday in connection to a case registered against them on the charges of
alleged anti-state activities
on social media. The challan of the case was presented in court before Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah today.",2025-09-15,Tahir Naseer,2121,0.000219

The bar leadership alleged that a group of lawyers assaulted its pre­­sident, harassed him, and rais­ed slogans against state institutions.
The FIR was registered against Imaan Mazari, Hadi Ali Chattha, Zainab Janjua, PTI-affiliated la­­w­yers Naeem Panjhuta, Fateh­ul­lah Barki and others under various sections of Pakistan Penal Code and Anti-Terrorism Act.
The lawyers had staged a protest on the premises of the IHC to oppose the suspension of
Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri
from judicial work.
The demonstrators carried pla­cards and raised slogans in support of judicial independence. Isl­a­mabad Bar Council member Ale­­em Abbasi, ex-president of the IHCBA Riasat Ali, and Advocate Mazari were prominent among the lawyers who attended the rally.
FIR includes terror charges; case filed over altercation following lawyers’ protest at IHC
However, tensions flared when — after the demonstration — PTI-affiliated lawyers, including Intizar Hussain Panjotha, Naeem Panjotha, and Fatehullah Barki, confronted IHCBA President Wa­­j­id Ali Gilani. Witnesses reported the PTI lawyers pushed Mr Gilani, leading to an altercation, before IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jaja and other lawyers intervened.
The IHCBA president, accompanied by the secretary and bar council vice chairman Naseer Ahmed Kayani, later condemned the incident and announced that a reference would be sent to the bar council seeking registration of a terrorism case against the accused lawyers as well as cancellation of their licences.
Mr Gilani alleged that a group of lawyers, including Imaan Mazari and Zainab Janjua, physically assaulted him, dragged him, and branded him a traitor.
He said they were armed and pressured him to support demands for filing cases against PTI foun­der Imran Khan, which he refu­sed. “We have no personal or political agenda. We are neither alig­ned with any party nor any judge. Our role is to serve the lawyers, and my press conference should not be politicised,” he stated.
Mr Jaja claimed the protest had been held without a formal requisition to the bar, in violation of procedure. He emphasised that a terrorism case would be pursued against those involved and a formal request made for cancellation of their licences. “We are not touts of any judge, [and] those acting as such will be exposed,” he remarked.
Vice Chairman Naseer Kayani cautioned against exploiting the case of Justice Jahangiri for personal motives. He announced that lawyers responsible for the attack would be barred from entering the IHC premises, and their licences suspended upon receipt of formal complaints.
The IHCBA leadership reaffirmed its commitment to uphold the constitution and the rule of law, vowing not to yield to pressure or intimidation.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943354/afghan-repatriation-resumes-after-chaman-blast,Afghan repatriation resumes after Chaman blast - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"QUETTA: The
repatriation
of Afghan refugees through the Chaman border resumed on Friday after being suspended for a day following a deadly
bomb blast
.
Officials said the process was halted on Thursday when a powerful explosion ripped through a crowded taxi stand near makeshift shops in the border town, killing six people.
At the time of the blast, large numbers of Afghan families had gathered at the Pak-Afghan border to return home. Authorities immediately suspended repatriation and evacuated families from the area for their safety.
The movement was allowed to resume on Friday after security forces cleared the site. Officials said the entire area was swept before Afghan refugees were permitted to approach the crossing point again.
On Thursday evening, the blast claimed four lives on the spot, while two of the injured later succumbed to their wounds.
Assistant Commissioner Chaman Imtiaz Baloch confirmed the explosion took place near makeshift shops at the taxi stand.
Eyewitness Asghar Achakzai, a local reporter, told
Dawn
that the powerful explosion left bodies mangled and body parts scattered.
Police said initial investigations indicated that explosives had been planted outside the shops.
The Balochistan Home Department confirmed the casualties and ordered an inquiry into the incident, urging citizens to cooperate with investigators. It vowed that the perpetrators would be brought to justice.
Pakistan
launched a drive
last year to repatriate undocumented Afghan nationals, citing security concerns and the need for strict border management.
According to government figures, more than one million Afghans without legal documents are living in Pakistan. Tens of thousands have already been repatriated through the Chaman and Torkham border crossings since the policy was enforced.
Officials say the campaign is aimed at ensuring that only those with valid visas and refugee cards remain in Pakistan.
Human rights groups, however, have criticised the policy as abrupt and harsh, warning that many returnees face uncertain futures in Afghanistan amid economic hardship and limited access to basic services.

Reports say that Rehan Ahmed (12) had been working at Ahmed Raza Warraich brick kiln at Pahrianwali. The boy was extracting mud from the mixer when its operator Arfan started the machine. As a result, the boy was crushed to death by the blades of the mixer machine.
Pahrianwali police have registered a case against the machine operator under section 322 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on the report of Maqsood Ahmed, the victim’s father, and started investigation.
The suspect is yet to be arrested.
The deceased boy was later buried in the graveyard of Phirey village near Pahrianwali after his funeral prayers were offered.
Reacting to the incident, the spokesman for the Punjab chapter of the Pakistan Brick Kiln Workers Association accused the police of not nominating the brick kiln owner in the FIR deliberately, alleging that he (the owner) not only employed an underage worker but also failed to ensure his safety.
He demanded registration of a murder case against the owner.
Moreover, the spokesman said that the labour department too was responsible for such incidents, demanding that the brick kiln should be sealed for taking no safety measures.
He said the authorities must enforce the regulations for the protection of brick kiln workers across the province.
Zohaib Virk, a spokesman for Mandi Bahauddin police, said that Pahrianwali police had lodged another case against a suspect, Wakeel Ahmed, who is administrator and owner of the brick kiln where the boy died.
The second case was lodged on the report of Saqib Hayat, Assistant Director of labour department, under various sections of Punjab Occupational Safety and Health Act 2019.
The owner has been charged for not ensuring workers’ safety at the workplace.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944691/dawnmedia-to-hold-air-pollution-moot-on-oct-11,DawnMedia to hold air pollution moot on Oct 11 - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: Building on the success of the Breathe Pakistan International Climate Change Conference, DawnMedia has announced plans to convene a moot focused on tackling the issue of air pollution.
‘The Air We Breathe’ will be held at the Expo Centre in Lahore on October 11, under the umbrella of
Breathe Pakistan
— an initiative to combat climate change that aims to mobilise citizens to incorporate environmental sustainability in their daily lives.
Air pollution has become one of the most pressing public health and environmental crises facing Pakistan, and Lahore in particular is no stranger to this phenomenon.
Once celebrated for its gardens, the city now ranks among the most polluted in the world, with PM2.5 levels far exceeding WHO safety limits, a DawnMedia statement said.
“Other major cities — including Karachi, Faisalabad, and Peshawar — face similar challenges, driven by industrial emissions, vehicular exhaust, stubble burning, and poor enforcement of environmental regulations.”
“Vulnerable groups — children, the elderly, and low-income communities — bear the greatest burden, with devastating impacts on health, productivity, and life expectancy,” it said.
Notable speakers are expected to include Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, federal and provincial ministers, justices of the Supreme Court and Lahore High Court, senior UN officials, global health experts, economists, and corporate leaders.
The conference will spotlight actionable solutions, foster high-level dialogue, and drive collective action for cleaner air in Pakistan. Sessions will cover a broad range of themes, including governance and policy frameworks, financing clean air, smog and industrial responsibility, judicial activism, public health impacts, nationwide air quality standards, and regional cooperation on transboundary pollution.
The conference is being organised in collaboration with the United Nations and the Government of Punjab. The Pakistan Business Council will be a knowledge partner, while IPSOS, CFP, and Carbon Track will be research partners.
The initiative is also supported by leading commercial stakeholders and several other public and private organisations, including English Biscuit Manufacturers, Bank of Punjab, Environment Protection & Climate Change Department, Punjab, OMODA & JAECOO-Nishat Group and NDMRF, among others, “reflecting a strong and growing alliance across sectors to address the urgent challenges posed by steeply rising air pollution in Pakistan,” DawnMedia states.

disruption
of mobile phone signals on premises of courts owing to installation of signal jammers in the nearby central prison.
A bench consisting of PHC Chief Justice S.M Attique Shah and Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan also asked ACS Mohammad Abid Majeed to submit a detailed report of a meeting scheduled the same day with all the stakeholders for amicable resolution of the matter.
The bench, while hearing a petition filed by Peshawar High Court Bar Association against disruption of internet and mobile phone signals on courts premises specially Judicial Complex, showed concerns over the problems faced by litigants and lawyers because of the issue.
The bench fixed the case again for hearing today (Friday) after Abid Majeed gave a detailed briefing and informed it that a meeting had been scheduled for Thursday wherein all relevant stakeholders including KP Bar Council vice chairman and presidents of PHCBA and Peshawar Bar Association had been invited.
PHC seeks report of scheduled meeting of ACS with stakeholders on the matter
The ACS hoped that through mutual consultation and deliberation, the matter would be resolved amicably in a manner that would address the legitimate concerns of legal community while also ensuring security imperatives of the prison administration.
The bench was hearing the petition amid strike by lawyers on the issue in the district courts on Thursday.
PHCBA president Aminur Rehman Yousafzai, vice president Arshad Ali Nowshervi, general secretary Zahidullah Zahid, PBA president Qaiser Zaman, KPBC vice chairman Ahmad Farooq Khattak, Dr Adnan Khan, Asad Zaib Khan and other lawyers appeared for the petitioner.
They requested the bench to issue directives to government to restore full signals/telecommunication traffic on courts premises.
ACS Abid Majeed, Inspector General of Prisons Usman Masood and the superintendent of Peshawar Central Prison, Najam, appeared along with the KP advocate general, Shah Faisal Uthmankhel, and the additional advocate general, Inam Khan Yousafzai.
The ACS apprised the bench that a significant number of high-risk and high-profile criminals including convicts affiliated with proscribed organisations had been confined in three main central prisons of the province situated in Peshawar, Mardan and Haripur.
He stated that secured cells had been designed and designated for those prisoners to be lodged therein. However, he added that despite strict security protocols, some of those inmates managed to gain unauthorised access to mobile phones, which were allegedly used to establish contacts with their associates outside the jail for purpose of engaging in or facilitating unlawful and potentially dangerous activities.
“In order to sever/cut communication links of such high-risk inmates, home and tribal affairs department was constrained to enter into an agreement with National Radio and Telecommunication Corporation (NRTC) for installation of signal jammers on the jail premises,” said Mr Majeed.
Unfortunately such a step, he added, may have inadvertently caused disruption to telecommunication signals in the adjoining areas including Judicial Complex and may have given rise to grievances among members of legal fraternity.
The bench observed: “We certainly appreciate the action so taken by the worthy additional chief secretary in the interest of maintaining safety and security of central prison and inmates confined therein, however, we cannot remain unmindful of the adverse consequences that may have resulted from installation of signal jammers particularly their impact on the access to justice of ordinary litigants.”
“We are deeply concerned about the hardships faced by voiceless and underprivileged litigants, who, due to disruption of telecommunication signals, may have been unable to establish timely contact with their counsels. This, in many instances, could result in unintended disposal of their cases for non-prosecution or in avoidable adjournments owing to their inability to appear before courts,” the bench observed.
Such consequences, the bench added, if left unaddressed, risk undermining the right to fair access to justice and legal representation, which must be preserved at all cost.
The bench directed the ACS to submit a detailed report of proceedings including minutes of the scheduled meeting duly signed by all the participating stakeholders.

exchange
with rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir yesterday and a clarification by him on the matter earlier today.
On Thursday, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”.
Today, he provided a clarification regarding the matter, saying that his words were presented “out of context”.
During the hearing of a case on a plea filed by a citizen named Abdul Jabbar — who sought the removal of his name from the Exit Control List — Justice Dogar addressed the matter, saying that Mazari was “just like a daughter” to him, and he was only explaining things to her yesterday.
“Being the chief justice and an elder, I was trying to make her understand.”
He went on to say that his remarks were presented out of context and “a storm brewed up”.
The IHC CJ maintained that during his exchange with Mazari, he had told her that she could disagree with his decisions, but she should have avoided making her criticism personal.
At one point, he reiterated: “I was explaining to her just as (I would) to a child, but she was not understanding. She was repeatedly mentioning fundamental rights. Does this court not have any fundamental rights?”
Moreover, it has been reported that during yesterday’s exchange, Justice Dogar also addressed Mazari’s husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying: “Hadi sahib, make her understand; if I get hold of her someday …”
However, he clarified today that he did not say anything along the lines of “getting hold of” Mazari.
“I did not say that I will get hold of her, [but] this [reported remark] is being circulated since yesterday. Hadi sahib was standing [there], so I asked him to take her away or I would initiate contempt of court proceedings.”
Later, Chattha maintained in a post on X that the judge had in fact made the reported remarks.
He accused the judge of lying and misconduct before referring to Justice’s Dogar remarks from today’s hearing.
The IHC CJ said during today’s hearing that in case of contempt of court proceedings, Mazari’s career would suffer.
Reacting to that, Chattha said Justice Dogar was “not eligible to hold judicial office” and that he had held “the entire high court hostage”.
Mazari’s response
Mazari, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, posted on X after yesterday’s hearing that “it is important for CJ IHC to understand that I am not activist Imaan Mazari in his court, I am a lawyer holding a brief for my client and conduct myself according to professional etiquette (and a court should do the same).”
She added that her client’s case “should not suffer because of any grievances a judge may have with her lawyer over the right to freedom of expression in a personal capacity”.
Following Justice Dogar’s clarification today, she again
criticised him on X
for making “sexist” remarks and accused him of harassing her.
“First, the chief justice misbehaved, harassed me at my workplace and threatened me openly in the court … Today again, he is passing sexist remarks.”
She asserted that she was neither his daughter nor a child. “I am a professional lawyer”.
Lawyers condemn
Multiple lawyers’ bodies also issued condemnatory statements today, with the  Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) demanding the removal of Justice Dogar from his post.
In a press release — which Mazari shared on X, thanking the association — the LHCBA said the body’s president, vice president and secretary “strongly condemn” Justice Dogar’s exchange with Mazari.
The statement said that lawyers were “officer[s] of the court” and their respect and dignity was to be prioritised just as those of respected judges who were working within the bounds of law and the Constitution.
It added that Justice Dogar’s “dictatorial behaviour is a gross violation of the judge’s code of conduct and it is immensely important to keep any such judge away from court proceedings”.
The LHCBA urged the Supreme Judicial Council — the highest forum responsible for disciplinary proceedings against judges of the superior judiciary — to remove Justice Dogar from his post.
The Karachi Bar Association (KBA) also issued a statement saying that it “strongly condemns the highly inappropriate conduct” of Justice Dogar.
“The association notes with deep concern that instead of maintaining judicial dignity and impartiality, the chief justice resorted to derogatory remarks and threats of contempt proceedings against the counsel. Such behaviour undermines the sanctity of judicial forums, intimidates members of the bar and is contrary to principles of justice,” the statement read.
It emphasised that lawyers had the right to represent their clients “without fear or harassment, and any attempt to suppress this right cannot be tolerated”.
Expressing solidarity with Mazari, the KBA urged the Judicial Commission of Pakistan, Supreme Court and Pakistan Bar Council to take notice of the incident.
“The judiciary must remain above personal remarks and coercive conduct; respect between bar and bench must always be mutual to protect the integrity of our justice system,” the KBA stressed.
The Balochistan Bar Council also issued a similar statement as the KBA, calling on the SJC to dismiss Justice Dogar from his post.
Separately, a group of female lawyers also became signatories to a condemnation of Justice Dogar’s remarks, terming them “sexist, threatening and unbecoming of a judge”.
The condemnatory statement said Justice Dogar’s remarks “reflect a deeply patriarchal attitude, and the threats are a source of concern. The purpose of contempt laws is to uphold the administration of justice, not for judges to hold a sword over the head of lawyers”.",2025-09-12,Tahir Naseer,1486,0.000171

After conflict, amid cross-border tensions, a cricket match was perfect to lower temperatures, open dialogue, and start the long and winding road back to normality.
Cricket now deepens divisions. Pakistan and India have a great history of fierce but sporting competition but the extent of cricket’s politicisation is damaging the status of these games. India is responsible. J’accuse.
Instead of eager anticipation for Sunday’s Asia Cup
match
, the focus is on
handshakes
, cancelled press
conferences
, fan boycotts, and overt political statements by players. This is a game in a tournament that matters little, in a group stage that feels unnecessary, between players that are ill-matched. In the grand scheme of things it’s a nothing match but the political agendas surrounding a game may never have been so corrosive.
The blame for this lies firmly at the door of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Yes, the Pakistan Cricket Board has played its part with missteps, but the BCCI has nurtured an environment that is in direct contravention to the norms of international sport. International Cricket Council, the sport’s theoretical ruling body, is nothing more than a wholly owned subsidiary of the BCCI — the international arm of the BCCI’s commercial operations.
This is a shameful situation. It’s false to pretend that cricket was never political. It’s probably the most politicised sport in the world, which is why the international game is surrounded by so much passion and emotion.
However, one purpose of cricket is to simultaneously allow that fervour to play out on a sports field — war minus the shooting — while the players, fans, and match officials show how it is possible to compete intensely but retain mutual respect and civility.
Cricket was politicised when it was run by Australia and England under the guise of the Imperial Cricket Conference (1909 to 1963), and then the International Cricket Conference (1964 to 1988). Despite the underlying colonialism and racism in those structures, the spirit of cricket was held up as a virtue best demonstrated on the cricket field. “It’s not cricket,” was a phrase that extended beyond the sport to highlight unfairness and wrongdoing.
Pakistan meet India in Super 4 clash of Asia Cup today
Looking back now, possibly with a Pakistan-tinted lense, the moment when the teams competing for the 1992 World Cup lined up on tiered seating, in coloured clothing, on a boat in front of the Sydney harbour bridge, with South Africa newly welcomed back to the fold, was the highest watermark in the ambitions for cricket as a truly global and unifying force. What would we give now for the naive optimism of that time?
The rest we know. Pakistan thrillingly won the first globally televised World Cup, losing to India on the way — as they tend to do in tournament cricket. The Asian nations wrestled control of the recently formed ICC — Pakistan and India working together to unseat Australia and England. Only for India to drop Asian allegiances, in particular with Pakistan, to realign themselves with Australia and England.
The pretence now is that the voice of any country other than India matters. We know why there is no sanction from the ICC, the BCCI subsidiary. But why is there silence from Australia and England, those moral high horse riders, when India refuses to uphold the spirit of cricket by refusing to shake hands with Pakistan, and India’s captain makes a pre-planned and overtly political statement at the post match conference. You can be sure if a player expressed a view on the genocide in Gaza they would be immediately censured.
The answer is money. Australia and England will say nothing because they are commercially dependent on India. The BCCI is motivated by money too. How is it that Pakistan and India end up in the same group in every global or regional tournament? It’s no mystery, of course. The cash cow needs milking.
Money is also the explanation for the BCCI playing both sides over the controversy of the Asia Cup. Despite the calls from India for a boycott against Pakistan, the BCCI wants its money from the tournament. But to appease its domestic zealots, the matches between India and Pakistan are tactically politicised.
Unfortunately in all this, cricket is barely discussed. The brief history of Pakistan India matches in tournaments is that Pakistan were the better team in the 20th Century.
India, nonetheless, did tend to beat Pakistan in ICC tournaments albeit with the air of plucky underdogs. The momentum shifted with the beginning of the 21st Century, when India’s power grew and Pakistan’s declined — on and off the field.  Since then Pakistan has had moments of superiority: the 2009 T20 World Cup, the 2016 Test Championship, and the
Champions Trophy of 2017.
However, the trends in cricketing performance and political power have been relentlessly downwards. Pakistan cricket is weak on and off the field, while India dominates. Pakistan still has talented players, but they are forced unready into international cricket and their talent destroyed.
The question for the politicians of Pakistan and the PCB is whether the individuals involved can put their personal agendas to one side and re-establish Pakistan as a force in international cricket? Pakistan does not have the commercial power of other countries. It is being politically outmanoeuvred and sidelined by India. The only way back, therefore, is through performance on the cricket field.
At the moment, we expect little. Pakistan are the underdogs, particularly because the batsmen have failed to deliver. They haven’t even done much against the minnows. Yet, there is potential here, and the only vague hope that Pakistan holds is that one of the batsmen, Saim Ayub or Hassan Nawaz, produces a match-winning cameo.
Maybe even Fakhar Zaman and Mohammad Haris might do something match winning. Stranger things have happened, except that there is nothing to suggest that Pakistan are in the right mindset to overcome a superior team.
Pakistan arrive at the Super Fours of the Asia Cup with a squad lacking experience and confidence, a coach lacking a track record, and a world game lacking integrity. The odds are entirely against a Pakistan win. But hope never dies in the heart of a cricket fan — and whatever the result here in Dubai, the scene of many Pakistan triumphs over India, Salman Agha’s team have every chance of finding themselves in the final in a week’s time.

• PM visits National Earthquake Simulation Centre at Tianjin University, lauds Chinese disaster management technology
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Turkiye on Sunday expressed deep concern over
genocide
of Palestinian people in Gaza at the hands of brutal Israeli forces and vowed to constantly raise the issue at all international forums.
The two sides made these commitments when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif
met
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Tianjin on the sideline of 25th
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
(SCO) Summit, being held in China.
A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said: “They expressed grave concern over the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza and reaffirmed their shared commitment to using international platforms to advocate for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and to condemn the ongoing Israeli aggression and genocidal policies.”
The two leaders also reviewed the current state of Pakistan-Turkiye relations and expressed satisfaction over the growing momentum in bilateral ties. The premier held a constructive bilateral meeting with the Turkish president on the sidelines of the SCO Council of Heads of State in Tianjin, China, the statement added.
President Erdogan offered sincere condolences over the loss of lives and property caused by ongoing floods across various parts of Pakistan. He expressed his country’s solidarity with the people of Pakistan and said that the government and people of Turkiye stood shoulder to shoulder with them in this hour of need.
PM visits Tianjin University
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the National Earthquake Simulation Centre at Tianjin University and appreciated the use of modern technology in China for disaster management.
He observed that the modern technology and methods being applied in China would prove extremely beneficial in tackling natural disasters in Pakistan.
By benefiting from Chinese expertise in this field, Pakistan would be able to adopt effective precautionary measures and strategies to deal with future disasters, reports
APP
.
Speaking about the ongoing massive floods in Pakistan, the prime minister noted that national-level efforts were already under way to deal with the recent flood situation in Pakistan. He said additional relief convoys had been dispatched by the federal government for flood-affected families in Narowal, Sialkot, Wazirabad, Hafizabad, Chiniot, and Jhang.
He directed the National Disaster Management Authority to ensure complete coordination with the Punjab government in view of the current flood situation and to provide full support to the provincial disaster management authorities.
PM Shehbaz also addressed students and faculty members of Tianjin University.
The prime minister urged Pakistani students currently studying there to gain the latest knowledge and technology with commitment and hard work and to utilise their expertise in Pakistan for the welfare and prosperity of their people. In his address broadcast on national TV channels, the prime minister expressed his satisfaction that more than 200 students from various parts of Pakistan were receiving education in Tianjin University.
He said it was an opportunity for them to study at a university regarded as ‘a cradle of great learning.’ Terming students as ambassadors of Pakistan, he expressed the optimism that owing to their hard work, dedication and commitment to equip themselves with the latest knowledge, they would return home as architects of the nation’s future.
He said that in Tianjin University Pakistani students would become experts who could contribute not only to China’s remarkable progress but also to development of Pakistan.

general elections
, who were summoned in an inquiry into alleged irregularities during polls.
A bench consisting of Justice Sahibzada Asadullah and Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan issued notices to ACE director and an assistant director and Election Commission of Pakistan through chief election commissioner, seeking their response to a petition jointly filed by five of the presiding officers, who challenged the inquiry and issuance of notices to them by ACE on Aug 29 for appearance.
The bench directed ACE to continue with the inquiry in accordance with law, but not to take any action against the petitioners till further order.
The petitioners including a lecturer at a local college, Ms Saima, and four others have requested the court to set aside and quash the impugned inquiry and the notices issued to them as the same were illegal and unconstitutional.
Seeks ACE, ECP response to plea against inquiry into election ‘irregularities’
Barrister M Yaseen Raza Khan appeared for the petitioners and said that his clients served as presiding officers at their respective polling stations during the general elections held in Feb 2024.
He stated that in the aftermath of the general elections, petitioners and others similarly placed presiding officers faced a heavy backlash from the candidates, who were unsuccessful in securing highest votes/seat in the assembly. He added that in that regard different complaints were filed against the petitioners and others before ECP under the relevant provisions of Elections Act, 2017.
He said that general allegations were levelled by all unsuccessful candidates, pertaining to the alleged tampering in the official records at the close of poll. He stated that it was alleged that presiding officers, including the petitioners, tampered with and issued fake and fabricated Forms-45 to returned candidates and uploaded the same on the website of ECP.
Barrister Khan submitted that petitioners were attending the inquiry proceedings before the relevant committees constituted by ECP under Elections Act and filed their replies etc as well.
He stated to the utter surprise of the petitioners, they received the impugned notices from ACE on Aug 29 for attendance in preliminary inquiry of July 16, 2025 initiated on the complaint of Taimoor Saleem Khan Jhagra, one of the candidates, regarding alleged irregularities and misconduct by presiding officers and others during the polls.
He said that the petitioners were directed to appear before an assistant director of ACE for the purpose of recording their statements in connection with the impugned inquiry.
The counsel stated that the petitioners appeared on the requisite date and recorded their statements. He said that the petitioners categorically informed the assistant director that they were on special election duty, on the orders of ECP, and as such their actions and complaints pertaining thereto were to be dealt with under Elections Act as ACE had no jurisdiction to inquire into any matter pertaining to elections.
He argued that the official was also informed that complaints, having the same allegations, were already filed by the same complainant before ECP, which were pending adjudication under Elections Act.
He stated that the petitioners recorded their statements to the effect that no illegality whatsoever was committed by them during the process of the last general elections.
He argued that the official kept the matter pending and informed the petitioners to expect further contact from ACE in connection with the inquiry.
The counsel contended that Elections Act and rules established a comprehensive and specialised legal framework for the conduct of elections, the resolution of election disputes and prosecution of election-related offenses.
He said when ECP, a constitutional body, was already seized of the complaint regarding election-related allegations, any parallel inquiry by the officials of ACE, an executive agency, on the same allegations, fell outside the exclusive legal mandate established for election matters.

Addressing a press conference, KIP Chairman Khalid Hussain Bathh ann­o­unced that the strike would continue until the government accepted and imp­lemented their demands related to gro­wers and landowners affected since 2022. Despite repeated requests, he regretted, the government had not taken steps to resolve their issues.
“We are once again presenting our 15-point charter of demands,” Mr Bathh said, adding that a hunger strike camp had been established outside the press club. He warned that if the authorities ignored their demands, the token strike could be converted into a general hunger strike.
He criticised the Balochistan government for failing to provide solar energy systems to growers and zamindars des­pite promises. Instead, he said, Quetta Electric Supply Company had been disconnecting their power connections.
Mr Bathh demanded that the government allocate funds to growers and zamindars for the solarisation of agricultural tube-wells. He also called for the restoration of Rabi canal tube-well connections in Manjoshori, Nasirabad, and the resumption of power supply in Harnai and Kuchlak.

bar
Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from performing judicial duties.
Secretary High Court Bar Association Manzoor Jaja issued a statement urging lawyers not to appear in courts. He said the step was taken as a mark of protest against what he described the “unjust stopping” of a sitting judge from judicial work.
The strike had a visible impact on the IHC’s functioning. Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar’s cause list was canceled, while Justice Saman Raffat Imtiaz did not reach the court.
The division bench comprising Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan also could not commence proceedings. Both the judges were present in the IHC; however, they did not convene the court giving a virtual nod to the strike’s call.
Interestingly, Justice Sattar issued show-cause notices to IHC registrar and deputy registrar over their leniency and failure to cope up with the strike call issued by Pakistan Bar Council against the police’s alleged brutality.
Justice Sattar then questioned the authority of the lawyers’ bodies to “prevent fellow lawyers and litigants from accessing justice”.
Meanwhile, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir and Justice Khadim Soomro were already on three-day leave, further affecting the day’s cause lists.
Despite the strike call, some lawyers continued to appear in urgent matters. Secretary Manzoor Jaja himself was present at the high court premises during the protest.
An official of the IHC, on the other hand, claimed that the available benches entertained all the petitions in accordance with their normal routine.
He said preventing a judge from discharging judicial work was not a strange action as the five IHC judges, including Justice Jahangiri in a petition filed before the Supreme Court in February this year, sought a similar direction against Justice Dogar, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Asif.
Meanwhile, former advocate general Islamabad Barrister Jahangir Khan Jadoon filed a petition in the IHC seeking the release of audio and video recordings of Chief Justice Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar’s courtroom proceedings.
The application, moved by Barrister Jadoon before the IHC registrar, related to the hearing held in Court No. 1 on September 16. The petitioner contended that during the proceedings, the chief justice had assured lawyers that no order was being passed against Justice Jahangiri.
However, following the hearing, it was revealed that the judge had been barred from performing judicial functions.
The plea requested that the complete recording of the 1pm hearing be provided to remove ambiguity. A USB was also submitted along with the application for this purpose.
Speaking to reporters, Barrister Jadoon said the court had indicated during the hearing that objections to the application would be addressed and the matter referred to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). “But later, an order surfaced stating that Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri has been stopped from working,” he said, terming the move a constitutional violation.
He argued that the chief justice did not have the authority to suspend a sitting judge from duty, and expressed fears that court footage could go missing, as had allegedly happened in the past. He said he intended to file a reference in the SJC against the IHC chief justice over the matter.
The petition has added further tension to the ongoing judicial crisis, with the suspension of Justice Jahangiri already drawing sharp criticism from the bar and raising questions over the constitutional limits of the chief justice’s powers.

by-elections
across the country due to the widespread
flooding
.
According to an ECP announcement, by-polls in five National Assembly constituencies and four Punjab Assembly constituencies have been put off in view of the flood situation.
The
disqualification
and sentencing of several PTI lawmakers by antiterrorism courts in connection with the May 9 cases had led the ECP to schedule by-elections in NA-66 (Wazirabad), NA-96 and NA-104 (Faisalabad), NA-129 (Lahore) and NA-143 (Sahiwal). By-polls were also announced for four Punjab Assembly seats — PP-73 (Sargodha), PP-87 (Mianwali), PP-97 (Faisalabad) and PP-203 (Sahiwal) — following the disqualification of PTI MPAs.
The ECP has now postponed polling in all these constituencies. The commission said a new schedule would be issued once the flood situation improves. It po­­inted out that both public and private infrastructure, including government schools and other buildings designated for polling stations and election record storage, had been damaged by the floods.
Civil administration and law enforcement age­ncies are eng­aged in rescue and relief operations, making it difficult for them to perform election-related dut­ies. The Punjab government had also req­uested postponement of the by-elections to free up staff and buildings for relief act­ivities, it said.
The ECP added that large segments of the population in the affected constituencies had been displaced by floods and heavy rains. As a result, many voters would be un­able to participate in the electoral process, risking disenfranchisement and low turnout.
Taking all these factors into account, the commission decided to postpone the by-polls until conditions improve.

floods
, the parliamentary committee of the PTI on Monday urged former prime minister Imran Khan to appeal to overseas Pakistanis to donate funds through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government to help flood-hit people in Punjab and KP.
The committee endorsed the decision of Imran Khan to
boycott
the by-elections and
resign
from parliamentary committees. It also decided to stage a daily boycott of the National Assembly to send a message to national and international community that the democracy does not exist in the country.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser, while talking to

“However, as international community has hardly shown any interest in supporting the flood victims, the committee decided to urge Imran Khan to appeal to overseas Pakistanis to donate funds for their support,” he said.
Replying to a question, Mr Qaiser further said that the overseas Pakistanis would be asked to transfer funds either to KP government or charity organisations of Imran Khan. The funds would be used to support flood victims in both Punjab and KP, he said.
“We fear that the crops will be ba­­dly affected due to floods, and next year there will be enormous pressure on the rupee as government will have to import food items including wheat and rice,” he warned. He said that the committee had decided to boycott the parliamentary sessions on a daily basis.
To another question, the PTI leader explaining the decision said that members of parliament would attend the sessions of the Senate and National Assembly and then walk out in protest.
He added that the country lacked the democracy, which was leading to continuous problems and growing security issues.

revival
of the long-delayed Karachi Circular Railway (KCR).
During a meeting at the CM House on Friday, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah proposed to Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi that technical experts from both Sindh and PR should jointly work out the modalities of the project.
According to a statement issued by the CM House, the chief minister stressed the urgent need to revive the KCR and expressed frustration over the project’s continued delays.
The statement said that the KCR would serve an estimated 650,000 passengers daily and provide critical east–west and north–south connectivity across Karachi. However, it added, the updated feasibility still awaits approval from Chinese authorities as the project is set to be executed under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
The chief minister proposed to the minister a collaborative approach, suggesting that the Sindh government and PR jointly develop the project, with involvement from donor agencies and the private sector.
The federal government decided to execute the project under CPEC, and as per the approved plan, the KCR has a 43.2-kilometre route, including 25.51km elevated and 17.7km on ground, and it would have 24 stations — 13 elevated and 11 on-ground.
The meeting was informed that anti-encroachment drives had already cleared over 11 acres of railway land along Drigh Road, Karachi University, Urdu College, and Gillani stations, but “problematic encroachments” remain near Liaquatabad and Urdu College.
The chief minister assured the minister that the Sindh government would continue to support PR in anti-encroachment operations and urban rehabilitation measures linked with the KCR route.
The meeting agreed that experts from both sides will jointly work out the final modalities of the KCR project, station outsourcing, and new train services.
The railway minister endorsed the chief minister’s proposals and gave assurances of full federal support.

According to eyewitness accounts, victim Z took cover behind an iron gate as two unidentified motorcyclists allegedly opened fire on him. The victim, however, escaped unharmed and the attackers managed to escape from the scene. The Harappa police registered a case under sections 506 and 34 of the PPC against two unknown suspects, based on Z’s complaint.
Speaking to

, Z said that he was standing near the gate of his house when two young men — estimated to be between 20 and 25 years old — approached on a motorcycle and fired directly at him. “It was dark, and I managed to hide. That’s what saved me,” he said. He claimed that he would be able to identify the attackers if he saw them again.
Local villagers, who witnessed the incident, confirmed hearing multiple gunshots.
The area has a documented history of communal tensions, particularly following the rise of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan. Notably, Z’s elder brother was also murdered by unknown assailants in a previous incident. At that time, police interrogated individuals affiliated with the Tehreek Tahafuz Khatm-e-Nabuwwat.
ASP Raosen Taj Raisani confirmed his presence at the crime scene shortly after the incident. “We are pursuing two to three leads and hope to trace the suspects soon,” he said.
WHEAT RECOVERED: Around 15,000 metric tons of wheat has been recovered from alleged hoarders during difierent raids conducted over the past three days at 15 warehouses across the Pakpattan and Sahiwal districts.

He said that while some warehouse owners had declared their wheat stocks, most were found to be storing large quantities without disclosure. A total of 9,860 metric tons of wheat had been confiscated in the district.
Separately, Sahiwal Deputy Commissioner Shahid Mahmood confirmed the recovery of 4,285 metric tons of undeclared wheat from a rice mill located at 99/9-L, Sahiwal.

Dawn
has learnt.
The amount mentioned in PC-I includes Rs7.23 billion for technology cost, Rs13.6 million for staff salaries, Rs31.164m for utilities expenses, Rs144.68m for consultancy, Rs1.4m for ISP connectivity, and Rs74.25m for contingency.
The Islamabad Safe City Project was launched in 2016 for Rs6 billion and transferred to the Islamabad police in 2019. The existing project was planned to cover 13 police stations, but it has now been decided to expand its coverage to 28 police stations. The upgraded surveillance systems, with state-of-the-art sensors, high-resolution cameras, and advanced analytics capabilities, will allow law enforcement agencies to closely track high-crime areas with efficiency and accuracy.
The existing system needs to be upgraded because it is approaching its shelf life. The video management system is fragmented with multiple outdated technologies and 80pc of the system is approaching the end of its life. It is critical to replace these with a unified video management system for seamless integration across all cameras and projects. A unified system will improve surveillance, streamline operations, enhance integration with other security and traffic systems and ensure long-term functionality.
Decision aims to replace outdated technology, ensure ‘high-quality surveillance’
Currently, there is partial functionality in the ANPR (automatic number plate recognition) system with Huawei cameras, but significant gaps exist in violation detection, the e-challan system and integration across different ANPR devices.
The existing facial recognition system is also nearing the end of its life, often malfunctioning, and is without integration for real-time blacklisting. Its replacement will facilitate faster identification and law enforcement action.
The data centre is predominantly outdated, with 80pc of the systems reaching their end of life, including the UPS batteries.
A proper replacement plan must be put in place for the data centre’s infrastructure, including cooling units, power backups and critical server hardware to avoid operational disruptions.
Similarly, both video and application storage systems are nearing the end of their operational lives, with frequent failures occurring. An upgrade is essential for data integrity, high-quality surveillance footage, and the long-term sustainability of the safe city infrastructure.
Currently, there is no backup site, which poses a significant risk in case of system failures. The establishment of a backup site at Diplomatic Enclave will provide data recovery capabilities, ensuring continuity of operations even in the event of a major system breakdown.
Under this project, about 3,187 cameras with higher technical specifications will be added to the Safe City system. These will be primarily used to cover the new locations; however, a few will be used to replace the existing low-specification cameras. The cameras will be installed at high-value premises, entry and exit points, crime pockets, processions/ protests/congestion points, public security points/crossings, and traffic choke points.
The extension is expected to serve multiple purposes, such as improving safety and security for citizens and visitors and enabling real-time traffic monitoring. Additionally, identifying new camera installation points will enhance the monitoring of public gatherings to mitigate terrorism risk and significantly reduce response times to incidents.
These new cameras are also expected to facilitate effective crisis management, prevention of untoward incidents, real-time monitoring of emerging situations, tracking of suspected vehicular and tactical and strategic operations, and intelligent traffic management.
A Project Implementation and Management Unit (PIMU) will be established at the Central Police Office under the supervision of the Inspector General of Police. Besides police officials, it will also include other co-opted members as recommended by the chairman. Additionally, a team of technical staff will be recruited to ensure the successful implementation and delivery of the proposed technological solution.

intervention
to fix the hearing of pending petitions contesting the 26th Constitutional Amendment before a full bench.
“This amounts to undermining and closing the doors of justice. Will file an appeal,” Khokhar said on X.
The
26th Constitutional Amendment
takes away the SC’s suo motu powers, sets the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowers a special par­liamentary committee to nominate the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges.
Invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the apex court for the enforcement of fundamental rights under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, Khokhar had pled the apex court on September 4 for the immediate fixation of the pending challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full court, in compliance with the Oct 31, 2024, decision of the judges’ committee under the 2023 Practice and Procedure Act — which called for fixing challenges to the 26th Amendment before a full court.
However, the registrar returned the petition in a September 19 notice to Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, the advocate-on-record for the petitioner, saying that Khokhar had “not pointed out as to what questions of public importance in the instant case are involved with reference to enforcement of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, so as to directly invoke jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution”.
The notice further said Khokhar was invoking the SC’s extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 184(3) for the “redressal of an individual grievance, which is not permissible” in terms of a prior judgment reported as 1998 SCMR 793, “Zulfiqar Mehdi. Vs. PIA, etc”.
“Ingredients for invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of this court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution have not been satisfied.
“Notice issued to the respondents is not properly drawn as it is not mentioned therein that for what purpose this constitution petition is being filed before this court,” the notice said, adding that multiple prayers were made in one constitutional petition.
Last month, CJP Yahya Afridi had
ignored
the decision made last year by a committee, constituted under the Practice and Procedure Act 2023, to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment of the Constitution before the full SC.
Since October 2024, multiple petitions have been filed with the SC challenging the amendment, contending that it “abrogates, repeals, alters and destroys the basic features of the Constitution” and “violates” fundamental rights.",2025-09-22,Umer Mehtab,680,0.000111
https://www.dawn.com/news/1944261/balochistan-legislators-seek-reopening-of-border-trade,Balochistan legislators seek reopening of border trade - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"QUETTA: Opposition and treasury benches of the Balochistan Assembly urged the government to reopen closed borders with neighbouring countries in border districts and introduce taxation system to help reduce unemployment and allow people living in border areas to earn their livelihood.
Balochistan emir of Jamaat-i-Islami Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman, who is also a member of the provincial assembly, took up the border closure issue in the provincial assembly session on Tuesday.
He staged a protest in the house against the closure of border with Iran in Panjgur, Gwadar and other border districts.
The JI leader said borders with Iran should be re-opened for resuming trade activities in border districts. He said that unemployment was fast rising. He accused the provincial government of being complicit in the economic misery of the people.
JUI-F MPA Ghulam Dastagir Badini urged to provincial government to introduce a taxation system in border regions to promote trade.  He urged PPP and PML-N members of the assembly to raise the matter at the federal government level.
Taxation system suggested to help people living in border areas to earn livelihood
PPP parliamentary leader and provincial minister Mir Sadiq Umrani said concerns highlighted by Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman fall within federal government’s ambit.
He proposed formation of a CM-led committee to hold a meeting with PM to resolve the issue.
Mr Umrani said that people of Makran division rely heavily on border trade for their livelihood due to lack of agriculture.
Provincial minister for planning and development Mir Zahoor Buledi said the government is committed to providing employment. He said that the government is running skill development programmes, and soon it will launch a loan scheme for the youth.
He announced that 13 border markets would be established to create employment opportunities for the people living in border areas of the province.
Mr Buledi said that terrorism incidents were linked to elements taking refuge in neighbouring countries, and the federal government was working to address the issue.
The speaker ruled that PML-N parliamentary leader Mir Saleem Khosa, PPP’s Mir Sadiq Umrani, and MPA Nawabzada Tariq Magsi, along with others, should meet the chief minister with proposals to resolve the matter.
Members who spoke on the border issue demanded a clarification from the government whether the decision to close the borders has been taken by the provincial cabinet or the federal government.
Members of the assembly also demanded creation of a new district comprising Tump and Mand. The, parliamentary secretary Mir Asghar Rind, Adviser to the Chief Minister Meena Majeed, and parliamentary secretary Barkat Ali Rind supported the proposal.
The assembly session was adjourned till Friday.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943576/punjab-ramps-up-steps-to-avert-wheat-crisis,Punjab ramps up steps to avert ‘wheat crisis’ - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"• Price control secretary says geotagging, verification of wheat stock decided for proactive planning; defends inter-provincial curbs to ensure ample supply
• Mills barred from using wheat for manufacturing poultry feed
LAHORE: The Punjab government has stepped up measures, including geotagging of stocks, to avert a potential wheat crisis in the province after floods in the eastern rivers washed away farmlands and destroyed stockpiles in its central districts.
The move comes amid
restrictions
on the interprovincial movement of the commodity by the provincial government, which has raised prices in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by up to 68 per cent, also prompting protests by Sindh and KP.
Sources told
Dawn
that the decision to restrict the wheat trade was taken to ensure an ample supply of the grain in the province and to avert a looming crisis. Besides this measure, the Punjab Price Control and Commodities Management also decided to start geotagging and physically verifying wheat stocks in warehouses across the province.
Its secretary Dr Kiran Khurshid notified a four-member departmental monitoring committee led by Deputy Secretary Shazia Rehman to collect data from all districts in collaboration with the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (Pera) and the food directorate. Through this practice, the wheat stocks stored in government and private warehouses will be registered to meet the food crisis feared in the aftermath of the floods.
Dr Khurshid said her department would implement the government policy to avert the unpredictable and unforeseen crisis post-floods. She said people had lost massive wheat stocks in the recent floods and now it was the government’s responsibility to take care of its citizens.
She said the price control and commodities department was geotagging wheat warehouses to gather information about the actual stocks and resources for predictive analysis and anticipative planning.
“The geotagging is just an intervention, not a solution,” she said, adding that it would take time to trace wheat.
She said the department had established a strategic management wing (SWM) to digitise the department’s assets, resources and activities of the department’s eight directorates. “All the scattered information would be available for the department and higher authorities in one dashboard for monitoring and taking informed decisions,” she said.
The Punjab Home Department, at the request of the price control department, had also imposed Section 144 and prohibited the mills in the province from using 10,184 metric tonnes of wheat for feed manufacturing.
Interprovincial curbs
Sources said the provincial government was keeping a strict check on the movement of wheat at the exit points of the province. They claimed that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had made it clear that her foremost duty was to stave off a food crisis in her province and ensure that the citizens got their due wheat share through government packages or other means.
She had also been quoted as saying that some four million people had been affected by floods and the executive machinery needed to ensure the availability of wheat for the flood survivors.
The price control secretary, Dr Khurshid, also acknowledged that Punjab was monitoring the wheat movement at the Sindh and KP borders because “businessmen would always like to sell their commodities, where they would get a better price”.
“In this situation, the government’s role is to ensure that wheat stocks in the province meet the needs of its people. It will be insane if the government lets its wheat go to other provinces at a lower price and later purchase it at a higher cost for its own people,” Dr Khurshid said. It may be mentioned that the government had not purchased wheat and there were no hefty stocks in government warehouses.
Meanwhile, the department arrested 107 profiteers, fined 12,043 profiteers, and registered cases against seven individuals. In the matter of over-charging in wheat flour prices, the department officials arrested 18 officials, registered cases against four individuals and fined 1,074 persons. In a crackdown on hoarders, the department has already recovered 334,000 metric tonnes of wheat across the province.
These measures helped increase wheat stocks in flour mills by 165,000 metric tonnes this month alone.
Additionally, the grinding of 360,000 metric tonnes of wheat has ensured a steady supply of flour and brought down wheat prices from Rs3,800 to Rs3,000 per 40kg.

• Authorities believe ‘sleeper cells’ have become active in metropolis
KARACHI: The ongoing inquiry into the targeted killings of policemen happened this year in the metropolis points to the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), as investigators believe that “sleeper cells” of the militant group have become active in the city.
The police have launched the investigation after registering a terrorism and murder case of the killing of a uniformed officer in Gulshan-i-Maymar on Wednesday evening.
Policeman Saddam Husain, 32, was gunned down by four assailants traveling in a car bearing no number plate in Tharo Mengal Goth, where the policeman had stopped for repair of his motorcycle from a mechanic shop.
The killers also took away his official sub-machine gun and the bulletproof jacket.
A senior police officer, who is investigating the recent targeted killings of policemen in the metropolis, told
Dawn
that so far no group had claimed responsibility for Saddam Husain’s killing. He added that his killing was different from the killings of other policemen occurred this year.
“The killers were traveling in a car, which was not the pattern of the militants belonging to the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan,” he told
Dawn.
However, the officer added that two groups of the banned TTP had claimed responsibility for the earlier attacks.
He said that militants had claimed responsibility for the killing of a traffic policeman deployed at a traffic post on Mai Kolachi Road. They also claimed responsibility for the attack on a police post in Qayyumabad in which a civilian lost his life and a policeman was wounded. Another policeman was wounded in DHA in a gun attack, whose responsibility was claimed by the TTP, he added.
The outlawed groups had also claimed responsibility for the killings of two policemen, one at Pipri in Bin Qasim and the other at Shah Latif Town. They also claimed the armed attack on a police mobile in DHA within the remit of the Gizri police station occurred just a couple of days ago.
However, the officer added that the claims of responsibility for the killing of ASI Abro in Bin Qasim and another policeman in Landhi by these groups had turned out to be doubtful. As, the officer believed, they could be linked to other factors as well.
The officer said the spate of killings seemed to suggest that TTP’s “sleeper cells” had become ‘active’ in the metropolis.
FIR in Maymar killing
Meanwhile, the Gulshan-i-Maymar police have incorporated Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act in the FIR registered for the killing of policeman Saddam Husain on Wednesday.
As per contents of the FIR, the policeman had brought his bike for repair at a mechanic shop in Tharo Mengal Goth on a road leading to Gulshan-i-Maymar at around 7pm when four attackers traveling in a white Alto car (without number plate) targeted him.
The investigation of the case has been handed over to the Special Investigation Unit of police.

Imran’s arrest on May 9, 2023 sparked violent protests across the country, during which state buildings and military installations, including the GHQ, were torched and vandalised.
He was expected to attend today’s hearing at the ATC via video link, but his counsel argued before Judge Amjad Ali Shah against this arrangement on the PTI’s application.
For his part, prosecutor Zaheer Shah contended that trial proceedings were transferred to the ATC from Adiala Jail — where Imran is imprisoned — on the Punjab government’s executive order. “The authority to review the executive order lies with the constitutional court,” he added.
He further argued that in 2016, the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended to allow suspects to appear in courts via video link.
Shah also cited Sections 15 and 21 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, saying that they authorised the courts to make “decisions regarding trials”. He added that the government was “not obliged” to give a reason for transferring the trial.
The prosecutor said submitting an application against Imran’s appearance via video link “is tantamount to creating hurdles in the trial and wasting time”. He said it was the defence lawyer’s right to approach the superior court against the notification for transferring trial proceedings from jail to the ATC, but the trial could not be stopped.
During his arguments, Imran’s lawyer, Faisal Malik, said, “We demand fair trial from the court.” He added that a fair trial was conditional upon the accused being physically present in the court.
He informed the ATC that they had received a copy of the provincial government’s notification yesterday, and they would approach the higher court against it.
The judge then asked Malik whether he wanted to present any more arguments on the matter.
At that, the defence counsel sought some time for consultation with his legal team.
The court then adjourned the hearing for half an hour.
When the hearing resumed, the testimony of two prosecution witnesses — Sub-Inspector Saleem Qureshi and Sub-Inspector Manzoor Shahzad — was recorded.
The witnesses presented 13 USB drives containing video clips to the court.
Forty videos of the PTI founder related to May 9 were downloaded, the witnesses said in their statements.
They also presented video clips of others, namely Khadim Khokhar, Shehryar Afridi, Umar Tanveer, Sadaqat Abbasi and Sikandar Mirza, along with clippings from various national newspapers, all of which were saved on the USB drives.
The witnesses said the “digital evidence” was obtained from CCTV cameras installed on Benazir Bhutto Road, Mall Road, Liaquat Bagh and ajoining areas.
Concluding the hearing, the court dismissed the PTI’s plea seeking Imran’s appearance during the proceedings in person and maintained that he would appear via video link, in line with the Punjab government’s notification.
The court summoned 10 more witnesses from the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, the Federal Investigation Agency, the PTI, the Press Information Department, Internal Security and the interior ministry to record their statements at the next hearing, slated for September 23.
Yesterday, a police spokesperson
told
Dawn
that security will be beefed up around the Rawalpindi ATC on Friday during the hearing of the GHQ attack case.

Anarob Infusion is an intravenous antibiotic drip containing metronidazole, commonly used in hospitals to treat serious bacterial infections in the stomach, skin, lungs, joints, and other parts of the body when oral medicines are not effective.
A medical product alert
issued
today said Drap’s Central Drugs Laboratory had informed the body that samples of the drug were declared “substandard” due to being out of specification for bacterial endotoxins.
“Use of this contaminated infusion may cause severe adverse reactions such as fever, chills, septic shock and life-threatening complications. Hospitalised and immunocompromised patients are at the greatest risk,” the authority warned.
It said its field force and Provincial Drug Control departments were directed to immediately conduct market surveys to detect and remove the affected batch (H24219) from the market.
It further directed that the regulatory field force of all federating units should also increase surveillance in the market to ensure the effective recall of the defective product.
Drap also ordered that all pharmacists and chemists working at distribution centres and pharmacies should immediately check their stocks and stop supplying the drug, with the remaining stocks being quarantined and returned to the supplier/company.
The authority requested increased vigilance within the supply chains of institutions/pharmacies/healthcare facilities likely to be affected by batches of the drug.
It instructed that any adverse reactions or quality problems experienced with the use of the drug be reported to the National Pharmacovigilance Centre (NPC), using the Adverse Event Reporting Form or the following
link
.
“Consumers should stop using products bearing the affected batch number and shall contact their physician or healthcare provider if they have experienced any problems that may be related to taking or using this drug product, and report the incident to Drap/ National Pharmacovigilance Centre,” the alert concluded.

lockdown
on September 29 to press for acceptance of its charter of demands, sat across the table from an Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government negotiating team here on Wednesday, with two federal ministers attending as facilitators — amid conflicting reports about the atmosphere of the meeting.
The gravity of the situation could be gauged from the fact that the federal government had
deputed
around 2,000 police personnel in AJK in anticipation of protests. Sources in Islamabad confirmed that the contingents had already been dispatched.
A day earlier, the office of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had issued a communiqué on the AJK situation, stating that in the backdrop of talks between the AJK government and the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), “the government of Pakistan intends to assist in resolving the impending issues peacefully and amicably.”
“In view thereof, the Prime Minister is pleased to direct that Ameer Muqam, Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, shall visit Muzaffarabad tomorrow (Wednesday) and interact with negotiation committees from both sides,” it read.
Addressed to the AJK chief secretary, with copies to JKJAAC and the concerned ministers, the communiqué urged the AJK government to extend necessary support for the process.
The letter came as a surprise for many AJK leaders, who had repeatedly accused the alliance — without directly naming it — of serving an “Indian agenda” by creating a law-and-order crisis.
The meeting began at 4:30pm in the Services and General Administration Department’s committee room, with breaks for asar and maghrib prayers.
The JKJAAC side was represented by nine core members: Shaukat Nawaz Mir, Faisal Jamil Kashmiri and Anjum Zaman Awan from Muzaffarabad division; Sardar Umar Nazir, Sardar Iftikhar Zaman and Raja Ghulam Mujtaba from Poonch division; and Advocate Saad Ansari, Imtiaz Aslam and Tauseef Jaral from Mirpur division.
The ministerial team included Col Waqar Noor and Sardar Amir Altaf (PML-N), Raja Faisal Rathore and Chaudhry Qasim Majeed (PPP), and Deevan Ali Chughtai and Zafar Iqbal Malik (PTI Forward Bloc). AJK Chief Secretary Khushhal Khan and IGP Rana Abdul Jabbar were also present.

LAHORE / DADU: The Punjab government on Tuesday
announced
a relief package for people affected by recent
floods
, but stopped short of giving a date for its distribution.
“A sum of Rs1 million will be given to the owner of a destroyed house and Rs500,000 for partially damaged houses,” Punjab Inform­ation Minister Azma Bokhari told a press conference.
She said that farmers whose land had been submerged would receive Rs20,000 per acre, while compensation of Rs500,000 would be provided for each cow or buffalo lost.
“All these payments are being made from the Punjab government’s own resources without seeking external aid,” she said, taking a jibe at the PPP that has been pressing the federal government to appeal to the international community for help.
Ms Bokhari said that “relief cards” would be introduced so that the flood victims could receive aid without standing in long queues.
She said 10,000 employees had been deployed to conduct surveys in flood-affected areas, but no timeframe had been set for compensation payments.
The minister said that more than 4.7 million people and 2.1 million livestock had been affected across 27 districts and 4,794 villages, including areas along three rivers. “For relief and rescue operations, 2,213 teams are still working in the field,” she added.
Ms Bokhari said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had visited every flood-hit area and claimed the provincial government had set an example in relief and rescue operations, while criticising opposition parties for politicising the issue.
Breaches in Sutlej embankment
Meanwhile, catastrophic
flooding
triggered by three breaches in the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the river Sutlej has inundated vast swathes of Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts, leaving thousands homeless and critical infrastructure severely damaged.
The embankment gave way at three locations — Noraja Bhutta union council in Jalalpur Pirwala, Bahadurpur and Jhangra. One breach widened to 400 feet, while two others stretched 30 to 40 feet.
The breaches diverted the Sutlej’s flow into nearby villages, submerging dozens of settlements, including Jhan­gra, Bahadurpur, Noraja Bhu­tta, Kotla Chakar, Tarut Bash­arat, Basti Lang, Basti Kanu, Depalpur and Khairpur Dha.
The floodwaters also damaged the M5 motorway and Gilani Road, creating a lake between the two roads. Authorities carried out a controlled breach at Gilani Road to divert water towards the Chenab River.
A senior irrigation official said 70,000 to 80,000 cusecs of water was still flowing in the Sutlej and could reach the area within a day or two. He said efforts were underway around the clock to plug the breaches, which could take up to 12 days to seal completely.
He said that the authorities were also diverting the water to the canals at Sulemanki and Islam headworks and 20,000 to 25,000 cusecs of water in the Sutlej would further decrease near Noraja Bhutta, which would take the usual course to enter the Chenab River.
Meanwhile, the residents of these union councils were forced to live on Gilani Road and other embankments under the open sky, many without tents or food.
Shakir Kanu of Basti Kanu told
Dawn
that water would not recede in their areas until the breaches at the Noraja Bhutta dyke were plugged.
He said that most houses in his locality were destroyed or collapsed, while some were under threat due to the continuously rising water.
“The government is making efforts to save the motorway and bringing heavy stones, but no effort is being made to save our areas,” he lamented.
Mr Kanu further said that the people and cattle heads were not getting proper food and they were also facing medical issues.
On CM Maryam Nawaz’s instructions, 44 additional machines were dispatched to the breach site in Lodhran, with senior ministers overseeing the operation.
Punjab Relief Commi­ssioner Nabil Javaid said that 4.7 million people had been affected across 27 districts, with 271 relief camps and 300 medical camps set up, while over 2.6m people and 2.1m animals had been moved to safety.
According to Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Dire­ctor General Irfan Ali Kathia, the overall water flow in Punjab’s rivers is normal and water levels in flood-affected areas are significantly receding, where rehabilitation measures are ongoing.
Dadu villages submerged
In Sindh, as a medium flood passes through the Kotri Barrage, several parts of Jamshoro district have been
submerged
.
These include parts of Sehwan, Laki Shah Sadar, Amri, Sun, Manjhand, Lakha, Indpur, Budhapur, Aliabad, Khanot, Petaro, Kotri, Khanpur, and Karokho, among others.
Homes , infrastructure and agricultural land in these regions has suffered extensive damage. In Sehwan, 10 more villages have come under floodwater. The flood has crossed the bridge on Indus Highway and reached the historic Lal Bagh area. Water has also entered the graveyard near Lal Bagh and inundated nearby homes.
Electricity supply has been completely suspended in the riverine areas, leaving residents in a lurch, while road links have been severed as connecting thoroughfares remain under water.
In addition, several parts of Manjhand are under water. Villagers from Goth Detha, located near the shrine of Shah Owais Qarani, are stranded after their road link was severed by rising floodwaters.
The area’s plight was depicted in a video shared on social media, showing a funeral procession trudging though three to four feet of water.

According to the residents, after erosion of its four acres, now the floodwaters were just around eight acres away from the basti. Apprehending submersion of the settlement by the fast-approaching floodwaters, they urged the authorities to take measures to check the land erosion within a day or two.
Similarly, Fatowali village, located between Bahawalpur and Sammasatta railway station, is also threatened by the Sutlej erosion and the locals have appealed the authorities to send heavy machinery to dump sandbags and stones to save the area.
On Tuesday, a private dyke near Basti Bhinda, in the  suburb of Bahawalpur city,
developed a breach
, resulting in inundation of the agricultural land around the settlement. However, the residents of the settlement have already been evacuated to safer  places.
Senate chairman visits flood relief camps in Multan
The flood-affected people in the Basti Shera flood relief camp say they badly need dry fodder (wanda) for their livestock.
In Multan district, according to the administration, the number of flood relief  camps has been increased to 90 with the increasing number of the flood-hit people in the area.
The administration claimed to have arranged meals and other basic facilities for the people in the taking shelter in the camps. Officials say that dry fodder has also been supplied for the cattle heads in the camps.
Meanwhile, Senate Chairman Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani on Tuesday visited the flood-affected areas outside Multan city.
Mr Gilani visited the flood relief camps at the Shershah Girls High School and  Buch Phatak, besides the Shershah Toll Plaza dyke.
Talking  to the media, Gilani claimed that there were adequate  stocks of anti-diarrhea and skin ailments medicines, in addition to the antivenom for snake-bite  cases.
He said that the next 48 hours were crucial as the flood peak was expected in the area during the  period.
He admitted that there was a shortage of tents, adding that he would take up the issue with the administration. He asked the people of other  areas threatened by flood in the rivers Chenab and Sutlej to shift to  safer places.
About the agricultural losses of the flood-hit people, the Senate chairman said the Punjab government should compensate them. However, he added: “We will also raise our voice from  our forum (Senate) for compensation of the flood-affected people.”
He opined  that to compensate the flood-affected people, there should be a national  policy to compensate the flood-hit people of the katcha areas.

sit-in
at the Sost Dry Port on Saturday, paving the way for the resumption of trade and tourism via the Pakistan-China border at the location.
The protest was
launched
in July against the government’s taxation policies and suspension of customs clearance at the port.
Trade leader Javed Hussain, who led the protest, told
Dawn.com
, that the announcement about traders ending the protest ending was made by the supreme council — a body that had represented the them in talks with the federal and GB government.
Following the negotiations, Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari had
announced
on Wednesday that the government had agreed to tax exemptions on imports coming through the Sost Dry Port — provided that the goods were for local consumption and meet strict eligibility conditions. The total annual value of tax exemptions was capped at Rs4 billion.
However,
expressing dissatisfaction
over the negotiations’ results, GB traders had decided to continue to the sit-in and hold a meeting with the supreme council.
Hussain said the traders had ended their sit-in on the suggestion of the council but, at the same time, he expressed reservations on the decision.
He maintained that the decisions taken during negotiations with the government were not completely in line with their demands.
Separately, trade leader Rehan Shah shared with
Dawn.com
that the protesting traders had held a meeting with the supreme council last night, during which the sit-in and the agreement reached with the government were discussed.
Shah added it was decided that containers stuck at the Sost Dry Port for the past two years would be cleared in the next two days and a statutory regulatory order (SRO) would be issued within a month, which he said would be the practical implementation of the traders’ demands. He added the supreme council and traders would hold another meeting to decide the future plan of action when the SRO was issued or even if its issuance was delayed.
Earlier, a committee constituted by the GB chief minister had
suggested
that a special consolidated SRO should be introduced to grant tax exemption for GB.",2025-09-27,Imtiaz Ali Taj,547,0.000101

According to a September 4 notification seen by
Dawn.com
, the suspensions were carried out “on account of producing poor results in SSC annual examinations 2024-2025”.
The suspended principals include those at schools in Akora Khattak, Aman Garh, Ghoriwala and Haripur-II. Similarly, the principals of schools in Hattar, Karak, Kohat-I, and Kohat-II have also been removed.
The action further extends to the principals in Peshawar-II, Mardan, Shehbaz Azmat Khel, Swabi and Swat, along with the principals of an institution in Takht Bhai and a higher secondary school.
“The vice principals of the concerned schools shall look after the duties of principal as [a] stopgap arrangement in their own pay scale till further orders,” the notification read.
“However, where the vice principals are not available, the seniormost employee (BPS-16/17)/acting vice principal shall look after the duties of principal as [a] stopgap arrangement in their own pay scale till further orders.”
KP Labour Minister Fazal Shakoor Khan told
Dawn.com
that the suspension was solely based on the performance of the teachers.
‘’We have zero per cent results in the mentioned schools,’’ he said. “The department has enough teachers, but we lack specialists in subjects other than Islamiyat and Pashto.”
Khan said that the majority of teachers in the department are from southern districts
“We have 80 to 90pc of our staff from southern KP. Each of them wants to be appointed in their home district, which is practically impossible,” he said",2025-09-07,APP,423,9.2e-05

LOWER DIR / PESH­AWAR: At least seven Frontier Corps (FC) personnel were martyred and 13 others injured during a search and strike operation against militants in the Sar Banda area of Maidan in Lower Dir on Thursday.
According to official sources, one FC soldier was also reported missing after a fierce gun battle with militants in the mountainous terrain within the jurisdiction of Lal Qila police station. The militants had taken positions and opened fire on a security convoy.
The wounded were shifted to Lal Qila Hospital, and later referred to District Headquarters Hospital Timergara.
Police officials said a heavy contingent of pol­ice, Elite Force and Dir Scouts remained in the area as the operation continued.
Security forces also claimed to have inflicted “significant losses” on the militants, though no details were immediately provided.
Lal Qila was once a stronghold of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Nifaz-i-Shariat-i-Muhammadi (TNSM), led by Maulana Sufi Muhammad.
His son-in-law, Mullah Fazlullah, became the head of the banned Teh­reek-i-Taliban Pakis­tan (TTP) and fled to Afghanistan during the 2009 military offensive in Malakand. He was later killed in an air strike in Afghanistan.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for the successful operations. In their statements, both leaders lauded the bravery and professionalism of the troops in eliminating 19 militants,
APP
reported.
“Pakistan is determined to eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorism,” President Zardari said, reaffirming the nation’s resolve to completely eradicate terrorism and praying for the safety and success of the security forces. PM Shehbaz also commended the security forces for successful operations in Mohmand, North Waziristan and Bannu, reiterating that the war against terrorism would continue until its complete elimination from the country.
Police post
Separately, militants launched a late-night assault on the Lajbook police post. Police sources said personnel deployed there repelled the attack after several hours of firing, forcing the militants to retreat. No casualties were reported.
In another development, the Lower Dir district administration imposed Section 144 on Thursday, banning the flying of drones, quadcopters and balloons across the district. Deputy Comm­issioner Mohammad Arif Khan directed assistant commissioners and police officials to ensure strict enforcement, warning that violators would face legal action.
19 militants killed
At least 19 militants were
killed
in three separate encounters with security forces across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.
“On 9-10 Sept, nineteen Khawarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khawarij were sent to hell in three separate engagements in KP” the ISPR said in a statement.
According to the statement, 14 militants were killed after troops engaged their hideout in an intense exchange of fire in the Guluno area of Mohmand district.
Another operation in Datta Khel, North Waziristan, left four more militants dead, while a separate encounter in Bannu resulted in the killing of one militant.
Weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain fighters, who, the ISPR said, had been involved in numerous attacks in the region. Troops were carrying out sanitisation operations to clear the area of remaining militants.
The ISPR reiterated that security forces were committed to wiping out “the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism” from the country.
Meanwhile, tribal elders of the Toji Khel tribe in South Waziristan resolved in a meeting on Sept 9 not to allow militants to operate from their soil. They warned militants to leave the area or face exile.
The elders also announced strict penalties, including demolition of houses and a fine of Rs2 million, against anyone found facilitating militants with food, shelter or other assistance.

In July, it emerged that an Islamabad court had
ordered
YouTube in June to block 27 channels for disseminating “fake, misleading, and defamatory” content against the government and armed forces. The sanctioned accounts were being run by journalists, political commentators and social media influencers in Pakistan and overseas. The ban order sparked criticism from various legal and digital rights groups.
Among the 27 channels were those of the PTI, journalists Matiuallah Jan, Wajahat Khan, Ahmad Noorani and Asad Ali Toor; former anchors Imran Riaz, Orya Maqbool, Sabir Shakir, and Moeed Pirzada.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944063/polio-mountain,Polio mountain - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE world’s battle against polio is stuck on a glass mountain. After 37 years and $22bn, the Independent Monitoring Board has declared that conventional strategies are running out of road.
Its latest
assessment
, The Glass Mountain, places Pakistan centre stage. The country has
reported
27 new cases this year — small in absolute terms, but large enough to confirm what the IMB calls “resurgence” in one of the last reservoirs of wild poliovirus.
The board’s findings are uncomfortable. It argues that Pakistan’s claims that transmission had been interrupted between 2021 and 2023 were an illusion created by Covid-19 restrictions. Lockdowns, not stronger campaigns, suppressed spread. That temporary reprieve has ended. With new infections surfacing, confidence in the programme’s direction is ebbing.
Eradication in Pakistan has long suffered from predictable failings: financing that rewards effort rather than outcomes, superficial ties to routine immunisation, accountability systems that churn out reports instead of penalties, and an unhealthy reliance on donor-driven firefighting rather than sustained domestic leadership. The result is a system skilled at producing plans and press releases but unable to guarantee that every child is immunised. District managers often recycle excuses, while politicians offer rhetorical commitment without following through on resources or enforcement.
The IMB now proposes shifting responsibility for eradication from Geneva to the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office. That change is intended to blunt the corrosive perception that polio eradication is a Western agenda imposed from outside. It may also force local politicians to accept ownership. For years, community hostility — stoked by conspiracy theories, mistrust of outsiders and repeated security lapses — has translated into refusals, boycotts and, tragically, killings of vaccinators.
Recasting the campaign as a regional priority could help repair that legitimacy gap. But the harder work lies at home. Pakistan’s federal and provincial authorities must treat polio not as an externally funded programme but as a national test of competence.
Chronic under-performance in high-risk districts cannot be indulged indefinitely. Integration with wider health services is overdue: routine immunisation and primary care should be the foundation, not an afterthought. Surveillance, meanwhile, needs sharper focus; environmental samples show far more virus in circulation than case counts suggest, signalling invisible chains of transmission that remain unbroken.
Eradication is not impossible. The coming low-transmission season offers an opening, but only if old habits are abandoned. More money and foreign technical help will not suffice. What is needed is innovation, political will and the readiness to hold failures accountable. A virus that once terrified the globe survives here still. Whether it is eliminated or allowed to endure will depend less on donors’ dollars and more on Pakistan’s resolve to climb its own glass mountain.

The remarks come days after alleged aerial
strikes
in KP’s Tirah valley killed at least two dozen residents, including women and children. The incident
prompted
protests in the region, with local tribesmen, as well as the
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan
, calling for an inquiry into the matter.
On the other hand, officials claimed that the explosions that led to the killings were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses.
During an interview on the
DawnNewsTV
show ‘Doosra Rukh’, Wali was questioned about the PTI-led government in KP criticising the security situation in the province, with some suggesting the party was on board with military operations, while others claimed the party opposed the measures. He was asked how he viewed this apparent contradiction.
In response, Wali said, “Our brothers, sisters, friends, sons, children, and elders in tribal areas should not give refuge to people targeted in military operations.”
“Do not make people who are wanted by the state your guests,” Wali asserted.
When asked if he meant locals were sheltering the terrorists, Wali replied: “It certainly cannot be an outsider. How would the terrorists be operating in these areas otherwise?”
“Someone has to be giving refuge to them and facilitating them. And when operations are carried out, our citizens also lose their lives.”
At this point, Wali was asked to confirm if he was saying that locals of tribal areas were giving refuge to terrorists.
To this, Wali did not respond in the affirmative but instead repeated his claim, saying, “There certainly has to be facilitation from some side.”
The country, mainly KP and Balochistan, has lately witnessed a
rise
in terrorist incidents, particularly after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)
broke
a peace deal with the government and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement personnel.
Earlier this month, at least one person was
killed
in a bomb blast while a cricket match was being played in KP’s Bajaur district on Saturday, according to the police.
In May, four children were killed and five others, including a woman, were injured in a suspected quadcopter munitions
drop

• SHC to hear judge’s plea against cancellation of law degree today
ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench (CB) on Monday suspended an Islamabad High Court (IHC) order restraining Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from performing his judicial functions.
Following the decision, the IHC revised its duty roster and restored Justice Jahangiri to judicial work.
Before adjourning further proceedings until today (Tuesday), Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, a member of the five-judge CB, asked counsel on both sides to assist the court on how the IHC took up the matter without first deciding the objections raised by the court office when the petition was filed.
The bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Shahid Bilal Hassan, was hearing an appeal filed by Justice Jahangiri of the IHC, challenging the Sept 16 restraining order.
A two-judge division bench, headed by Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, had issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition by Advocate Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution.
The petition questioned the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree from the University of Karachi and sought a writ of quo warranto, asking “by what authority” the judge holds judicial office.
Monday’s hearing in the packed Courtroom No. 4 was also attended by five IHC judges — senior puisne judge Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Raffat Imtiaz.
All entered the Supreme Court premises as ordinary litigants through the general reception area rather than using the entry reserved for judges and lawyers.
The five IHC judges have  already filed petitions challenging the administrative powers being exercised by the IHC chief justice, alleging that such powers have been used to undermine the judicial authority of high court judges.
During the proceedings, Justice Mandokhail recalled that the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) is scheduled to meet on Oct 18 to hear several complaints against superior court judges.
The CB made it clear that it would only examine the Sept 16 restraining order and not the main petition questioning Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
The order was suspended after the bench consulted among themselves after senior counsel Munir A. Malik, appearing for Justice Jahangiri, argued that allowing the IHC order to stand would send a damaging signal against the judiciary.
The original petitioner in the IHC, Mian Dawood, and Additional Attorney General Chaudhry Amir Rehman waived notices when the CB issued them.
When Munir Malik requested the suspension of the IHC’s unilateral order, Justice Aminuddin Khan remarked that the CB would not repeat the same mistake.
The counsel, however, insisted that the principle of comity required that the Sept 16 order be suspended.
After a brief consultation among themselves, the judges suspended the order and adjourned the hearing until Tuesday.
Duty roster revised
Following the CB order, the  IHC revised its duty roster and restored Justice Jahangiri to judicial  functions following the Supreme Court’s suspension of the order that had  earlier barred him from hearing cases. Justice Jahangiri had been  excluded from the sitting roster after being suspended by an IHC  division bench.
Earlier on Monday, Justice Jahangiri, along with  four other IHC judges, appeared before the Supreme Court. Following the  proceedings, the other judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar  Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — resumed their  scheduled benches and continued regular court business, while Justice  Jahangiri remained sidelined until the apex court’s decision.
The  revised duty roster issued for Tuesday formally re-included Justice  Jahangiri, confirming his return to judicial work after days of  suspension.
SHC hearing on petition
Meanwhile, the Sindh High Court (SHC) is set to hear a petition filed by Justice Jahangiri today (Tuesday), challenging the cancellation of his law degree.
Justice Jahangiri has impugned the
decisions
of KU’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate, which cancelled his degree in August last year.
The IHC judge recently approached the SHC, but at the time of filing, the court’s additional registrar (writ) raised several objections, including questions about the maintainability of the petition and the delay in filing it.
However, the IHC judge submitted that the court would be satisfied about these objections at the time of hearing of his petition.
The petition is fixed before a two-judge regular bench of the SHC comprising Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Justice Mohammad Abdur Rahman.
In his petition, Justice Jahangiri contended that the “illegal and mala fide” cancellation of his LLB degree occurred in the context of his “unflinching judicial independence”.
Justice Jahangiri claimed that when the campaign to have him removed through the SJC failed, “a new strategy” was adopted by misusing official processes and institutions. He said the degree cancellation became the basis for the IHC’s
decision
to restrain him from judicial duties.
He described the KU Unfair Means Committee’s decision as “shocking and surprising,” noting that the committee revived the issue after 32 years without issuing him a notice or providing reasons.
KBA appeal
Separately, Karachi Bar Association (KBA) President Amir Nawaz filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the SHC’s Sept 25
order
, which had dismissed a set of petitions against the cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree over non-prosecution.
Filed through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi, the appeal argued that the SHC had erred by holding that the issue of maintainability had to be decided first before hearing applications for recusal or questions of jurisdiction of the SHC’s constitutional bench.
The petition contended that the SHC’s reasoning was irrational and illegal.

Three main roads linking Sahiwal with Toba Tek Singh, Kamalia, Faisalabad, Gojra, Arifwala, Burewala, Vehari, Khanewal and Pakpattan have been completely washed away at multiple points with breaches exceeding 200 feet.
Additionally, six smaller roads in villages are now impassable. They include the road from Murad Kay Katiya to Chak 18B/7-R, Kachi Pakki to Jhangi Sial, Kachi Pakki to Mauza Siyal, Chandini Chowk to Chichawatni, Purani Chichawatni to Chak 119/7 D-R and Kachi Paki to Chak 104/7-R.
The damage isn’t just to the road surface, approximately 100 culverts (known as pulli) have been destroyed and floodwater has eroded the ground beneath the roads in some areas.
This has halted all light and heavy traffic among the five affected districts for the past three days and dozens of villages in the area got disconnected. As a result, thousands of commuters and commercial vehicles are stranded, leading to a shortage of produce in the local vegetable market as supplies from Faisalabad and Toba Tek Singh can’t get through to Chichawatni.
Cattle traders are also struggling to bring livestock to the Chichawatni market, which is now serving as a shelter for flood-affected animals. Despite a recent drop in the Ravi’s water level to 123,000 cusecs, the Flood Forecasting Division, Lahore, has warned of a new surge of 150,000 cusecs expected to reach Sahiwal tonight due to heavy rains in upstream districts of Punjab.
The local administration is on high alert. Muhammad Ramzan, executive engineer (EXEN) of the highway department, explained that repairs to the inter-village roads can’t begin until the floodwater recedes.
“In case tonight more water comes, the situation will get worse as the water has already submerged 80pc of roads.”
He said the C&W department is trying to install a steel bridge to reconnect a 200 foot breach on the main Chichawatni-Kamalia road, hoping to restore limited traffic within 48 hours if the new flood surge doesn’t cause more damage. However, residents fear that the incoming water would overwhelm the temporary structure. The department is still assessing the full extent of the damage to both major and minor road networks.

complaint
, lodged by lawyer Imaan Mazari against Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, the court administration stripped the judge of her powers to entertain harassment complaints.
Ms Mazari earlier approached the IHC’s anti-harassment committee, and also sent a reference against CJ Dogar to Supreme Judicial Council.
In response to her complaint, Justice Imtiaz, being the ‘competent authority’, not only entertained the complaint but also formed an inquiry committee in consultation with her fellow judges.
A circular from her office said that, being the competent authority under the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010, the inquiry committee comprising Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, and Justice Imtiaz has been formed to conduct an inquiry into the complaints of harassment against the IHC judges.
Imaan Mazari-Hazir also moves plaint before SJC
However, the court administration sw­iftly de-notified her as the competent au­­thority and replaced her with Justice Ina­­am Ameen Minhas.
As per the court record, a similar committee was already constituted in 2019, comprising the member inspection team (MIT), deputy and assistant registrars under the said act, in order to probe the allegations of harassment. A senior official of the IHC, however, claimed that the act was not applicable to judges as they could only be charged under Article 209 of the Constitution.
Another reason for de-notifying Justice Imtiaz was that being the competent authority, she could not be part of the inquiry committee. Subsection 4 of section 4 of the Act says, “The Inquiry Committee shall submit its findings and recommendations to the Competent Authority within thirty days of the initiation of inquiry.”
Last week, Ms Mazari and CJ Dogar had a
heated exchange
during the hearing of case. At the time, Justice Dogar had warned Ms Mazari of contempt and was reported to have passed warning remarks along the lines of “getting hold of her”. Ms Mazari said she was only fulfilling her professional duty and was ready to face contempt proceedings.
Separately, the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) submitted a challan in the
controversial tweet case
against Ms Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatha, in the court of Senior Civil Judge Abbas Shah.
The court has also issued notices to the accused and directed that copies of the challan be provided to them at the next hearing, scheduled for Sept 17.
The NCCIA had registered a case against them over alleged controversial tweets under cybercrime laws. Both accused are facing charges of violating online content regulations, which authorities argue could incite unrest.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941924/calls-for-boycott-in-india-ahead-of-asia-cup-match-with-pakistan,Calls for boycott in India ahead of Asia Cup match with Pakistan - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Some Indian politicians and former cricketers have called on their country to boycott its matches with Pakistan in the ongoing Asia Cup tournament, as the two arch-rival teams are set to face each other in Dubai today.
An India-Pakistan cricket match is always a blockbuster. Still, emotions will run even higher in today’s Asia Cup clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who fought a four-day
military conflict
in May. The countries have been at odds in various matters since then, including claims of
downing jets
,
ceasefire requests
,
geopolitical narratives
and of course,
cricket
.
Several former Indian players and politicians have
urged
the BCCI to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities. New Delhi only cleared the match in a recently announced
sports policy
, saying the Indian national team can play Pakistan in multi-national events but not in bilateral competitions.
Former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, head of the Shiv Sena-UBT party, has announced that his party will organise protests across the state against the game,
Hindustan Times
reported
.
“Our prime minister said blood and water cannot flow together, so how can blood and cricket flow together? How can war and cricket be at the same time? They have done business in patriotism. The business of patriotism is only for money. They are going to play the match tomorrow also because they want all the money they will get from that match,” he was quoted as saying.
Later, Indian news agency
ANI
shared on X a
video
, with a caption saying, “Shiv Sena (UBT) burns Pakistani national flag in front of Thiruvananthapuram AG’s office in protest against India vs Pakistan match today in Asia Cup.”
Ahead of today’s game, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal
posted
on X: “Playing a match with Pakistan is treason against the country. Every Indian is extremely angry about this.”
He was commenting on a
post
by AAP’s Delhi unit president Saurabh Bharadwaj, who wrote: “Blood and sports cannot go together.”
ANI
also
talked
to a Congress leader, Ajay Rai, on that matter, who urged the Supreme Court of India to stop the country’s team from playing against Pakistan in accordance with “public sentiment”.
A day ago, the AAP protested against the match between Men in Blue and Green Shirts, with Bharadwaj and party workers burning an effigy symbolising Pakistani players,
The Hindu
reported.
Former cricketer Kedhar Jadhav, also a part of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said the India-Pakistan fixture should not go ahead.
“I don’t know what will happen, but I have already said that according to me, this match should not be played,” Jadhav was quoted as saying by
The Times of India
.
The matter had also reached the Indian top court as four law students filed a petition against the match, contending that it was “against national interest”. But the Supreme Court on Thursday
rejected
the plea.
Indian news anchor Shiv Aroor
said
Asia Cup was “precisely the opportunity the [Government of India] should have taken to signal that Pahalgam & [Operation] Sindoor = new rules on terror”, referring to New Delhi’s
allegations
against Islamabad about a
deadly attack
in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which Pakistan
strongly denied
.
“‘Multilateral tournament’ excuses are pathetic, embarrassing. We make the rules,” Aroor said on X.
Meanwhile, a
video clip
of Indian anchorperson Arnab Goswami has been doing rounds on social media where he is calling for the match’s boycott and and saying that this match should garner the lowest television rankings. He went on to question the Indian cricket board and
Sony TV
, which has the broadcasting rights for the Asia Cup, that who gave “permission for the match”.
Ex-cricketer and politician Manoj Tiwary told
ANI
he was boycotting the match, as well as the entire Asia Cup. “It needs to be understood that this is just a sport; this is not life. We are comparing human lives to sports; this should never be done.”
He also questioned the BCCI’s “justification” for playing the matches, adding that the team could have forfeited today’s face-off and reached the finals by winning other games.
‘A compulsion’
On the other hand, BJP lawmaker and former sports minister Anurag Thakur defended the BCCI’s stance on playing against Pakistan in the Asia Cup.
“When multinational tournaments are organised by ACC or ICC, it becomes a compulsion, a necessity for nations to participate,” he told
ANI
.
“If they don’t do that, they will be eliminated from the tournament, they will have to forfeit the match, and the other team will get the points,” he added, before pointing out that India does not play bilateral tournaments with Pakistan.
Actor Suniel Shetty, father-in-law of cricketer KL Rahul, echoed similar sentiments: “It’s a world sporting body. They have to abide by those rules and regulations because there are a lot of other sports and a lot of athletes who are involved in them.
“As Indians, I think that is our personal call that we have to take, whether we want to see it, whether we don’t want to see it […] and that’s a call India has to take, but you cannot blame cricketers for playing because they are sportsmen, they are expected to represent the country,” he told reporters.
On this side of the border, former captain
Wasim Akram
has urged Pakistani and Indian cricketers to ignore the noise and “enjoy” the game. “Forget about everything other than cricket. One team will win, and one team will lose,” he told
AFP
.
BCCI defends stance, citing future hosting risks
However, Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) Secretary Devajit Saikia defended his country’s decision to play against Pakistan. He told
Hindustan Times
that it was an international tournament and that a boycott would “bring a lot of negativity for all our future endeavours of hosting any multinational tournament”.
“Had it been a bilateral tournament, we could have always said that we would not play against any hostile country. And so far as Pakistan is concerned, we are not playing any bilateral tournament since 2012-13 onwards,” he added.
India’s fielding coach Ryan ten Doeschate
said
the team has been instructed to strictly follow the directives of the BCCI and the Indian government. He added that head coach Gautam Gambhir, who in May had also
called
for a boycott, has called for focus on cricket.
“Our thing is, you separate sports and politics,” he said. “I understand the sentiment, but we are following the directives of BCCI and the government. We are going by what the government and BCCI told us.
“The Asia Cup was in limbo for a long period of time, and we didn’t think we’d be coming at one stage, but obviously the Indian government stance in it and now you have to put the sentiment and emotions behind … it’s something we addressed in the team meeting today,“ ten Doeschate added.
Still,
Hindustan Times
, citing a report in
Dainik Jagran
, said “most” BCCI officials have decided to distance themselves from the upcoming India-Pakistan match. The report claimed that a BCCI official would only be seen on-camera if India won.
Today’s clash could be the first of three as both India and Pakistan are favourites to qualify for the Super Four stage and possibly for the September 28 final.

Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the incident, calling it a “terrorist attack”.
“Following the incident, security forces gave a swift and effective response, eliminating four terrorists,” a post from the Balochistan government’s X account quoted him as saying.
“The terrorists cannot weaken the nation’s resolve through cowardly acts. The sacrifices of the people and security forces will not go in vain. We remain committed to making Balochistan peaceful and secure. I express solidarity with the families of the martyrs, pray for the elevation of their ranks, and for the speedy recovery of the injured.”
Later, speaking during an event in Quetta, he said that “an operation against the terrorists is underway”.
President Asif Ali Zardari termed the incident a “suicide attack”.
“The president has strongly condemned the suicide attack in Quetta carried out by the
Fitna-al-Khawarij
, the misguided extremists acting on India’s agenda,” a statement from the President’s Secretariat said.
Fitna-al-Khawarij
is a
term
the state uses to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“The president said that the elements serving the interests of
Fitna-al-Khawarij
and India cannot undermine Pakistan’s peace and stability. He commended the security forces for their timely and effective response, which foiled the malicious designs of the terrorists.”
According to the statement, the president “prayed for the swift recovery of the injured FC personnel and lauded the courage and resolve of the country’s security forces in defending the motherland”.
Later, an X post by the Pakistan government said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had commended the security forces for killing the “terrorists of
Fitna-al-Hindustan
” who carried out the attack.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as
Fitna-al-Hindustan
to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The government statement said the PM also prayed for the quick recovery of the injured citizens and security personnel.
He expressed the resolve to defeat the nefarious designs of elements causing harm to citizens and their properties. “We will mete out exemplary punishment to elements trying to harm the security of the country,” the statement quoted him as saying.

Following the explosion, the Balochistan Health Department imposed an emergency in hospitals across the capital, according to Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman.
“An emergency has been declared at the Quetta Civil Hospital, Balochistan Medical College (BMC) Hospital Quetta, and the Trauma Centre,” a statement from Rehman said.
“All consultants, doctors, pharmacists, staff nurses, and paramedical staff have been directed to remain present in the hospitals.”
Speaking to the media later during a visit to the Civil Hospital, Health Minister Kakar said that the condition of six injured people was critical.
“A major terrorist plot was planned. I strongly condemn the blast near FC headquarters,” he said, adding that most of the injured were civilians.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941800/rising-floodwaters-in-thatta-riverine-area-force-villagers-to-evacuate,Rising floodwaters in Thatta riverine area force villagers to evacuate - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"THATTA/LARKANA: Rising pressure of floodwaters on the Baghar Ochto protective dyke of Indus River has triggered fresh fears of flooding in Mangli area near Ghorabari as Chhachh Lake in the riverine area has already overflowed and submerged several villages.
Entire settlements of Ramzan Mallah, Usman Khaskheli, Urs Mallah, Allah Dino Mallah, Haroon Mallah, Ghulam Mallah, Haji Shahdad Khaskheli, Haroon Khaskheli, and Suleman Mallah have been encircled by water, cutting off their road access to nearby towns. The villagers are now using boats to receive food and other essentials.
As the lake swells with Indus waters, reverse flow has begun, inundating vast tracts of the riverine belt. The Ghar Marhu canal, which irrigated hundreds of thousands of acres through Udero Lal Barrage on the river, was blocked near the GBU dyke last week in a desperate attempt to preempt damage from the rising floodwaters.
But preparedness on ground remained questionable. Near Isa Khaskheli village, the irrigation department has set up only a makeshift hut manned by a few junior staffers.
A bulldozer stationed on-site stands idle for lack of fuel. During a visit by journalists, the dyke was found abandoned, with no senior irrigation officials in sight.
“The bulldozer has just been parked here for show. It has no diesel,” said the machine’s operator, adding that repeated appeals for fuel had been ignored by the officers concerned.
For villagers in Isa Khaskheli, Basar Khaskheli, Ali Muhammad Khaskheli, and Gheel Mori town, anxiety grows by the day. With their homes under water and escape routes severed, they fear the dyke could collapse in the absence of urgent intervention.
Local communities demanded immediate action against negligent irrigation officials and deployment of trained staff and resources at the Baghar Ochto dyke to prevent what they warned could become a humanitarian disaster.
Irrigation officials busy strengthening dykes
In Larkana, the officials had foc­us­ed on taking maximum possible measures to ensure the deluge safely passed under Sukkur Barrage and flowed down to the sea with minimum and no damage.
Presently, Moria Loop Bund, New/Old Abad Loop Bund and Hakra Loop Bund managed by Northern Dadu division were declared highly sensitive where irrigation officials were vigilant and busy strengthening the existing structures.
Reports from Naudero on Saturday suggested that the Indus was continuously rising at Burira Ferry point forcing villagers in riverine area to shift to the dykes. As soon as water receded they would return to their dwellings.
A number of few families, who had taken shelter on Larkana-Sehwan dyke near Dodo Sanhari village, complained to this reporter about lack of assistance from the district government.
At Larkana-Khairpur bridge alongside the ‘Palija bund’, floodwater was coming close to the dyke while the irrigation department had temporarily built huts manned with staff to keep an eye on the situation.
A large number of dumpers and trucks loaded with stones were being unloaded at Moria Loop dyke where the river was striking with full force and mounting pressure.
MPA Mir Nadir Magsi had on Friday said the New/Old Abad dyke was highly sensitive. Northern Dadu Division’s superintendent engineer Jamil Sangi, assistant engineer Riaz Abbasi and sub-engineer Nadeem Jaffery told journalists at the dyke on Saturday that work was going on to strengthen the dyke.
This dyke was located four kilometers upstream near the structure of Larkana-Khairpur bridge and was part of Larkana-Sehwan dyke, said Mr Sangi.
The river at this point had created an island and shifted its main current about one mile away from the main dyke while stagnant water was also staying there. The irrigation officials said that main current could at any moment shift, as it all depended on the behaviour of the river.
Sources in the irrigation department disclosed that Japan International Coope­ration Agency (JICA) had committed to strengthen the New/Old Abad dyke. The work would only start once the required studies as per JICA’s criteria were completed, said the sources, adding that two years had passed since the commitment.
The sources said that the dyke was not in good shape and a team of experts from JICA was due to arrive on Monday to visit the site along with the irrigation officials concerned.
Almost all depressions close to the dyke were filled with floodwater but surprisingly the dwellers were still reluctant to leave their houses and move up to the dyke or to safer place.
At Hakra Loop dyke six kilometers from Mohenjo Daro irrigation staff were posted in temporarily built huts. Work on apron and stone pitching was under way from 13/0 miles to 22/2 miles where floodwater struck the dyke. Presently 16/1 mile of Hakra dyke was risky, said the irrigation staff stationed there.
There are five spurs to protect the Hakra Loop dyke however it was seen that residents of riverine area were trying to reach the dyke after wading through stagnant water inundating their land, crops and houses.

RAWALPINDI / LAHORE: The Pakis­tan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) has
forecast
rain, wind and thunderstorms across the upper parts of the country from Sept 15 to 19, warning of possible flash floods, landslides and damage to weak structures.
Authorities have been asked to remain vigilant and make necessary arrangements.
The Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) also issued an alert for the 11th spell of monsoon rains from Sept 16 to 19 in the catchment areas of all major rivers in the province.
According to the Met Office, moist currents of moderate intensity from the Arabian Sea are penetrating the northern regions, while a westerly wave is likely to approach from the evening of Sept 15, persisting until Sept 19.
Under these conditions, rain with thunderstorms is expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Kohat, Peshawar, Char­sadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu, Karak and Waziristan between Sept 16 and 19, with occasional gaps.
In Kashmir, scattered showers are forecast from the night of Sept 15 to 19, with heavy falls likely on Sept 16 and 18. Similar conditions are expected in Gilgit-Baltistan, including in Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche and Shigar, between Sept 16 and 19.
In Punjab and Islamabad, rain and thunderstorms are predicted in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal and Jhelum from Sept 16 to 19, with showers likely in Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Wazirabad, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikh­upura, Sialkot, Narowal, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Sahiwal, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh and Faisalabad on Sept 18 and 19. Isolated heavy falls are also expected.
Sindh and most of Balochistan will remain largely dry, with partly cloudy skies in coastal areas.
The PMD warned that windstorms, hailstorms and lightning could damage weak structures such as Katcha houses, billboards, electric poles, vehicles and solar panels.
It also cautioned of landslides in vulnerable hilly areas of KP, GB, Murree, Galiyat and Kashmir.
Heavy rainfall may trigger a rise in local nullahs and streams in Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbo­ttabad, Charsadda, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Murree, Galiyat, Islam­abad, Rawalpindi and Kashmir on Sept 18 and 19.
The department advised the public, travellers and tourists to avoid unnecessary exposure to vulnerable areas and stay updated on the latest weather advisories.
Flood threat in Sindh
With floodwaters moving downstream from Punjab, authorities in Sindh are on high alert as Guddu and Sukkur barrages brace for rising inflows. On Sunday, Guddu Barrage was passing a peak of 627,000 cusecs, with irrigation officials warning the figure could climb to between 650,000 and 700,000 cusecs in the coming days.
The Sindh Irrigation Department has identified vulnerable points on both banks of the Indus between Kashmore and Sukkur, particularly in the kutcha (riverine) areas of Ghotki, Shikarpur and Khairpur.
Officials say constant monitoring and reinforcement work is under way, though they remain cautiously optimistic that the flood peak will pass Sukkur without causing major damage.
Meanwhile, Sindh Senior Mini­ster Sharjeel Inam Memon has said so far over 163,000 people have been moved from riverine areas to safer location in view of the exp­ected flood.
In a statement issued here on Sunday, he said during the last 24 hours 5,269 people were evacuated from Katcha area.
He added that 252 people from riverine areas were shifted to relief camps, where a total of 469 people are currently staying.
Mr Memon said that 11,569 cattle were moved to safe areas during the last 24 hours, raising the total number of relocated cattle to 438,835.
He added that 51,308 cattle were provided with vaccines and treatment in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number treated to 1.2 million.
He said that the Sindh government has established 177 fixed and mobile health sites, where 6,596 patients were treated in the last 24 hours. So far, a total of 84,118 patients have received medical assistance, he added.
Motorway closure
Meanwhile, Motorway Police said that due to the possibility of damage to the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M-5) as a result of floodwater near Jalalpur Pirwala, it has been closed to traffic.
“Northbound traffic is being redirected from Uch Sharif, Jhangra and Jalalpur Interchange,” Mot­orway Police spokesman Syed Imran Ahmad said in a statement. “Southbound traffic is being diverted from Shah Shams, Sher Shah and Shujaabad South to alternative routes.”
Mr Ahmed added that NHA personnel are placing sandbags and stones to block floodwater.
In Alipur tehsil of Muzaffargarh district, water was continuously flowing in its union council, Azmatpur, Mullanwali, Bazwala, Khangarh Doma, Sarki, Muradabad, Binda Ishaq, Mudwala, Lati Mari, Kundrala and Seetpur and submerged several villages.

Cotton zones hit
Moreover, for the first time in the country’s history, all major cotton zones in Pakistan have been affected by simultaneous rains and floods.
Though initial assessments suggest no significant damage to the crop nationwide, with the exception of severe losses in the Bahawalnagar district of Punjab, this week is critical for the country’s economy as a major flood surge from south Punjab enters Sindh, with continued rains in some Sindh districts set to determine the fate of cotton and other crops.
Ihsanul Haq, chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, said in a statement that Pakistan faces its biggest crisis due to Indian water aggression and unexpected rains. The full extent of crop damage, especially to cotton, will not be clear until the end of September.
He noted that the climate changes caused by the rains and floods have led to a minor virus attack on most cotton varieties in many cotton zones. He believes that a spray of urea fertiliser or boron could help mitigate this initial virus attack.
A high-level meeting on cotton rehabilitation, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, was held last week. It was attended by four federal ministers and various stakeholders.
While different proposals were reviewed, it’s widely believed that cotton rehabilitation will be difficult without enforcing crop zoning laws, which include a complete ban on sugarcane cultivation in cotton zones.
Sugarcane cultivation in cotton zones is a major concern. According to Mr Haq, it leads to environmental pollution that not only reduces the quantity of the cotton crop but also negatively impacts its quality. This is evident in regions like Balochistan and areas of Sindh and Punjab bordering Cholistan, where sugarcane is not grown.
The cotton produced in these areas sells for at least Rs500 per maund more than regular cotton because of its longer, stronger fibres and higher oil content in the seeds.
Last week, cotton trading in Pakistan was limited, and prices remained stable at Rs15,500 to Rs16,500 per maund.
Flooding continues
Meanwhile, catastrophic flooding continues to ravage south Punjab as broken dykes along the Sutlej and Ravi rivers have submerged hundreds of villages, disrupted major transport routes and displaced millions.
The PDMA and local administrations were managing evacuations and relief efforts amid rising water levels due to broken dykes and controlled breaches.
The evacuation operation continued in Khanewal, Kabirwala, Pir Mahal, Multan, Jalalpur, Jhangra, Uch and Alipur tehsil in Muz­affargarh district.
In Khanewal, several more villages were submerged after a canal dyke of Chak 58 was broken on Saturday night, while the government could not seal the Mai Sufuran dyke at the Ravi River near Head Sidhnai, and the water was inundating villages in Pir Mahal, Khanewal and Kabirwala.
In Multan’s Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil, the administration carried out a breach at Gillani Road to divert the flood from entering the city two days ago and it submerged several villages of Uch Sharif.
The controlled breach was also not filled after two days, and water continuously passed through it, causing a flood in the Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts.
Jalalpur city also lost its road connection with the Lodhran district after all the roads were submerged after the Noraja Bhutta dyke was broken three days ago. The Sutlej River water changed its direction and submerged several villages near Jalalpur Pirwala city and also reached the motorway exchange.
Relief operations
Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said that 4.57 million people of 4,700 mouzas were affected due to floods in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers in the province.
Sharing details about Pakistani and Indian dams, Mr Javaid said that Mangla Dam was 93 per cent full, Tarbela 100pc, while the Indian Bhakra Dam at the Sutlej River was 88pc full, Pong Dam 94pc and Thein Dam 88pc.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia on Sunday visited a relief camp in Seetpur union council of Alipur tehsil in Muzaffargarh district.
He told the media that evacuations were continued in flooded areas of Alipur, Jalalpur Pirwala and Rahim Yar Khan.
He predicted that the flood situation would ease significantly over the next two days, with only the Chenab at Panjnad Headworks currently in an extremely high flood at 411,000 cusecs. The Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was flowing at a medium flood level of 98,000 cusecs, while Head Sulemanki reported a low flood with a discharge of 78,000 cusecs.
Four children drown
Four children, including three siblings, drowned in a rainwater-filled pit in the suburban area of Killi Faiz Muhammad Charmai, Kohlu district, police said on Sunday.
According to police, the children were playing near the pit when they slipped in and were unable to get out. Despite efforts to rescue themselves, all four drowned.
Police and residents rushed to the site after the incident and retrieved the bodies, which were shifted to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Kohlu. All had died before reaching the hospital, officials confirmed.
The bodies were later handed over to the families after legal formalities. Residents said they had repeatedly warned the landowner to fill the deep pits, cautioning that they posed a danger to children. However, the owner allegedly continued excavating soil for sale, ignoring the warnings.

Lyari and Malir rivers serve as Karachi’s main storm drains,
channelling
rainwater through a network of nullahs into the Arabian Sea. Once natural seasonal streams, they are now heavily constricted by urban sprawl, encroachments, and solid waste, turning many drains into open sewers. This blockage reduces their
capacity
to carry stormwater, causing frequent urban flooding during monsoon downpours.
Four more people died in rain-related incidents in the metropolis today, raising the death toll since
yesterday
to eight, while three were missing, according to rescue services.
Edhi rescuers recovered the bodies of three men and a woman after a van carrying four people fell into the rain-filled Konkar Nadi in Gadap Town, a statement issued by the Edhi Foundation said.
The rescue operation to find the other missing people was underway, the spokesperson added.
Separately, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told
Dawn.com
that the body of an 18-year-old man, identified as Ahmed Qadir, was brought to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital from North Nazimabad’s Block-C after he “died of an electric shock”.
A man was saved alive and the search for another was underway after the two went missing in the Malir river, a statement issued by Rescue 1122 said.
The man rescued was identified as Mustafa Ali Gul, while Farhan Akram remained missing. Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad and the Malir deputy commissioner were present on the site, Rescue 1122 added.
Two others were rescued alive after they were trapped in the Lyari river, Rescue 1122 said in a
statement
, shared by the Sindh Information Department.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah refuted rumours of the operational section of Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway (Malir Expressway) caving in or being breached to divert waters.
Asked about a
video
being shared on social media that showed a paved section caving in during a media talk in Karachi, CM Shah explained: “Malir Expressway is under construction at that place. A bund is being built properly on the river, so when water from the river comes and it (the bund) is incomplete, then the water will pass through some location or another.
“That is it. There is no issue,” he added, advising people to “use their energy” for a better cause.
The CM’s spokesperson, Abdul Rasheed Channa, also issued a statement refuting reports of Shahrah-i-Bhutto caving in, saying: “It is not [a] real picture.”

A further statement from the chief minister’s spokesperson said there was “no truth” to the news of an operational part of the highway being washed away.
“The unpaved part of Shahrah-i-Bhutto has sunk down in the rainwater, and work is still ongoing. This is the part of Shahrah-i-Bhutto that has collapsed and neither a retaining wall has been built nor stone pitching has been done. This is part of the Malir section, which is under construction and is not yet open to traffic,” the statement said.
It added that sections of the road that were open for traffic were still being used by the public.
According to Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) data as of 8pm, Karachi received the highest amount of rainfall in Defence Housing Authority’s Phase 7 (32.6 millimetres).
PAF Masoor Base recorded 20mm, Keamari 19mm, Korangi 18.9mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar 16.9mm, Surjani Town 13.8mm, North Karachi 12.8mm, University Road and Orangi Town 11.8mm, Airport Old Area 11.5mm, PAF Faisal Base 11mm, Gulshan-i-Hadeed 8mm, Saadi Town 7.7mm, Jinnah Terminal 5.2mm, Nazimabad 5mm and Bahria Town 3.4mm.
Water enters Saadi Town; 318 relocated from near Malir river
Separately, CM Shah visited various locations across Karachi — including the Lyari river, Jinnah Avenue, Saadi Town and Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway — to review water drainage following the rains.
Footage from
DawnNewsTV
showed that the road linking Superhighway to Thado Dam was inundated, with water gushing into a stream and people gathered near the spot.
The Sindh CM, accompanied by Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani, visited the flooded Saadi Town through the Malir Cantonment route, the provincial Information Department said on X.
“The water entered Saadi Town due to overflow of the Lath and Thado Dams,” the chief minister was informed. He met with the local residents and directed authorities to carry out speedy water drainage.
During his visit to Jinnah Avenue, CM Shah “inspected the drainage of water from the dams via Mehran Nala and reviewed the machinery deployed for dewatering”, the Information Department said.
In a statement detailing his visit to the Lyari river, the chief minister was quoted as saying that the flow of water in the Lyari river was “high, but the flows are running smoothly”.
He explained that the river began from the mountains of Manghopir and Gadap, gathering rainwater from those areas. “The Lyari river passes through Orangi Town, SITE area, Nazimabad, Liaquatabad, Gulbahar, Lyari Town, Kharadar, Meethadar and West Wharf, and then reaches the port.”
CM Shah, Ghani and Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also visited the
Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway
, which is expected to be completed by the
year’s end
, and the
Qayyumabad Chowk
near Korangi Causeway.
Separately, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, in a post on X earlier today, said that so far, 318 people have been “rescued [and] moved to safe [places] from around the [areas] close to Lyari Naddi and teams are still present on ground”.
“All major arteries of the city as well as underpasses are clear and open for traffic,” he asserted.
In Saadi Town, joint efforts by Rescue 1122 and the Pakistan Army resulted in the rescue of 10 people, Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said in a statement.
“Near Saima Society, two men, three women and six children were safely moved,” Khan told
Dawn.com
. “Eight people were trapped in Nashr Basti and Isa Nagri due to waterlogging,” he added.
Memon said large-scale rescue and relief operations were underway in view of the recent rains and rising water in the rivers. “The situation in Karachi after the rains is gradually improving. Due to the filling of the dam and heavy rains, the Lyari and Malir rivers overflowed,” he said.
Schools to remain closed today
Meanwhile, the Sindh government has ordered the closure of all educational institutions across the Karachi Division following heavy monsoon rains and a forecast of further showers.
“All the educational institutions (public/private) will remain closed within the territorial jurisdiction of Karachi Division,” said a notification by the Karachi commissioner, dated September 9.
The PMD said in its weather forecast for today that yesterday’s depression over southwest Sindh moved nearly westwards and was now lying 60 kilometres west of Karachi.
“It is likely to move further westwards and gradually weaken into a well-marked low-pressure area in next couple of hours. Under its influence: light to moderate rainfalls are expected in Karachi division, Jamshoro, Thatta and Sujawal districts today,” the PMD said, adding that hot and humid weather was expected in most parts of the province.
It said the weather forecast for Karachi division for Thursday was partly cloudy and humid with
chances of drizzle/light rain and partly cloudy and humid on Friday.
Memon said a new spell of rain was predicted in 24-48 hours, adding that the Sindh government was on full alert. “If there is no more rain, the situation will return to normal in a few hours,” he said.
Several hundred straw-mud houses in the rural areas of Tharparkar and Dadu districts were swept away as the two districts had been receiving intermittent heavy, moderate and light spells of monsoon rains for the last six and four days, respectively.
PM directs NDMA to expedite relief activities in flood-affected areas of Sindh
Taking notice of the flood situation in Karachi and other areas of Sindh, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to fully cooperate with the provincial government and Sindh Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) in relief operations.
The prime minister also appreciated the active rescue operations being carried out by Rescue 1122, the Pakistan Army and Rangers in Karachi.
According to a press statement issued by the PM Office, the prime minister also expressed sorrow over the drowning of citizens in the Gadap stream.
The prime minister instructed relevant authorities to locate the missing persons in the floods as soon as possible.
“The awareness campaign should be further activated to inform the public about the flood situation to protect as many citizens as possible,” he added.
The premier also directed authorities to take immediate steps to restore the flood-affected communication infrastructure.
“The federal and Sindh governments are fully mobilised to deal with the flood situation,” he said, emphasising that the relief and rehabilitation of families affected by the floods in Karachi must be prioritised.",2025-09-10,Dawn.com,2309,0.000233

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940341/fgeha-head-summoned-in-corruption-case-against-officials,FGEHA head summoned in corruption case against officials - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has summoned the director general of the Federal Government Employees Housing Authority (FGEHA) to record his statement in a case related to alleged illegal disbursements.
The case is based on multiple inquiries related to illegal award of the Built-up-Properties (BuP) of G-13 and G-14 and the Park Road project.
The FIA clubbed all the inquiries of these sectors pending since 2009, a senior official of the FGEHA said.
The FIA notice issued to the FGEHA chief stated that an inquiry into the affairs of the authority was being carried out and “it appears that you [DG FGEHA] are acquainted with the circumstances of the inquiry.”
As per the notice, the DG was earlier asked to join the inquiry on Sept 1 but he “remained unable to join the inquiry proceedings.”
Deputy director and six others have already been arrested by FIA for alleged illegal disbursement of funds in G-14 BuP award
Subsequently, he has been “once again directed to join the proceeding at the FIA Corporate Crime Circle on Sept 9 (today) to respond to the question the investigation team framed for him.”
The FGEHA official said the DG was not facing any inquiry, however, since he is the custodian of the record, the investigation agency needs his statement to proceed with the inquiry against the delinquent officials.
He said the DG had recently held a meeting with the DG FIA on the pending inquiries and also informed the latter about the connivance of FIA officials with corrupt elements of his own department as well as with contractors.
He claimed that the recent arrest of some FGEHA officials was made in consequence of the information shared with the DG FIA by his counterpart in the FGEHA.
It may be mentioned that last week FIA arrested a deputy director FGEHF along with six others for alleged corruption and illegal disbursement of funds in the supplementary award of the BUPs of the sub-sectors of Mouza Thala Sayedan, G-14.
The suspects allegedly illegally showed private individuals as co-owners of five BUPs along with that given to original owners. Private individuals received funds based on false information.
The FIA is also conducting an inquiry into alleged illegal disbursement of Rs518.8 million.
Four officials of the FGEHA, including a deputy commissioner, have been suspended for alleged embezzlement of billions of rupees compensation meant for the affected landowners of G-14/1.
The investigation into the alleged embezzlement stemmed from grievances related to the FGEHA’s settlement claims for land acquired in Chellow and Jhangi Syedan, oldest villages within the boundaries of the newly-developed G-14/1. While the FGEHA has developed other G-14 sub-sectors over the past 15 years, work on G-14/1 only began recently.
Local landowners, numbering around 300, alleged blatant foul play. They claimed that while they awaited fair compensation, the FGEHA disbursed Rs518.98 million in cash compensation and awarded prime plots worth an estimated Rs25-30 million each to a select group of 32 individuals.
Documents showed most of the beneficiaries were investors, not original local residents. At least six individuals received multiple cheques with several recipients belonging to the same family.
According to an FGEHA official, the authority has so far recovered over Rs280 million while the recovery of remaining amount was in progress.

“Lawyers should remain within their jurisdiction and judges within theirs, because the real stakeholders are the people. Both lawyers and judges are servants of the people, and the greatest nationalism is to be honest and truthful with one’s own people,” he said while addressing a joint dinner hosted by Turbat, Gwadar and Panjgur bar associations on Wednesday.
The BHC chief justice said that most litigants approaching courts belong to poor segments of society and arrive with hopes of justice, yet they often face difficulties. To reduce these hardships, he announced the establishment of public convenience centres, including daycare facilities, shelter homes for women and waiting rooms.
He added that litigants would be treated with dignity and respect in courts, warning that strict action would be taken against any officer who ignored public dignity.
Justice Bareach said the judiciary was introducing a self-accountability system for lawyers to expose mafias and black sheep in the profession. He noted that some mafias had even inducted their children into the legal field only to protect their black businesses, but such elements must now be removed from the system.
He cautioned the bar councils against corrupt practices to secure votes, saying vandalism, forgery and treason would not be tolerated. It was the duty of bar councils, he stressed, to weed out wrong elements and uphold the dignity of the profession.
The BHC chief justice also announced that, following the establishment of a copy branch, statements and paper boxes would be provided free of cost to poor litigants to remove barriers in accessing justice.
“The honour of the ‘black coat’ lies in honesty and integrity. On the basis of this honour, the public entrusts lawyers with properties worth billions and with serious cases like murder. Damaging this trust amounts to damaging the entire system,” he observed.

• Nasir Shah again given local govt portfolio in addition to energy
• Saeed Ghani appointed as labour minister
• Four more special assistants to CM also appointed
KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah unveiled a significant cabinet reshuffle on Friday, involving key portfolio reassignments and the induction of two new members, and bringing the number of cabinet members to 23.
In addition to changes at the ministerial level, the provincial government also appointed four more special assistants to the chief minister.
Political observers viewed the reshuffle as mere eyewash, which comes at a time when the provincial government is under increasing pressure over governance failures, especially in Karachi, where sanitation, water supply, and urban planning remain unresolved issues.
Senior PPP leader Saeed Ghani, who is the party’s Karachi president, was stripped of his local government portfolio in the reshuffle, with Nasir Hussain Shah, who previously oversaw the Planning and Development Department, taking over the LG role along with the portfolio of the Energy Department.
Mr Ghani was given the portfolio of labour and social protection, which he had earlier held before being assigned the LG department ministry.
Muhammad Ismail Rahoo was allotted the Ministry of University and Boards Department, which he had also held in the previous tenure of the PPP-led Sindh government.
According to a notification issued by the chief secretary, the governor appointed Mr Rahoo as the provincial minister on the advice of the CM.
Later, in a simple ceremony, Governor Muhammad Kamran Tessori administered the oath to Mr Rahoo.
Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, provincial ministers, advisors, Opposition Leader in the Sindh Assembly Ali Khurshidi and Inspector General of Police, Sindh, Ghulam Nabi Memon were also present on the occasion.
The ceremony, held at the Governor House, was moderated by Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah.
The chief secretary also announced the appointment of Giyanoo Mal alias Giyan Chand Essarani as advisor to the chief minister for the rehabilitation department.
Makhdoom Mehboob-uz-Zaman was moved from the rehabilitation department to the food department. In turn, Jabbar Khan, who previously managed the food department, was reassigned to head the relief department.
Other changes saw Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro given the additional charge of the Planning and Development department, Makhdoom Mehboob-uz-Zaman moved from rehabilitation to the food Department, replacing Jabbar Khan.
In addition to changes at the ministerial level, the provincial government also made adjustments among advisers and appointed four more special assistants – Dr Sham Sunder K. Advani, Faraz Abid Lakhani, Muhammad Tariq Hassan and Atta Muhammad Panhwar.
Dr Sham Sundar was given the portfolio of minority affairs, Muhammad Ali Rashid information science and technology, while Sarfraz Rajar was handed charge of the archives department.
A spokesman for the CM House said that the special assistants were not cabinet members.
Earlier on July 2, 2024, Lal Chand Ukrani, Sardar Faraz Rajar, Qasim Naveed Qamar, Waqar Mehdi, Rajveer Singh, Mansoor Shahani, Usman Hignoro, Abdul Jabbar Khan, Junaid Baloch, and Muhammad Saleem Baloch had been appointed as special assistants to the chief minister.

The FIA is a border control agency which plays an important role in preventing
illegal immigration
and
human trafficking
. Its crackdown on human smugglers intensified following the
capsizing
of a boat carrying illegal immigrants near Greece in December last year.
During a visit to the FIA Headquarters in Islamabad, the delegation was welcomed by FIA Additional Director General Jan Muhammad and received a “comprehensive” briefing on Pakistan’s border management practices.
The head of the Iraqi delegation “reaffirmed Iraq’s commitment to further strengthening cooperation between the border management agencies of both countries,” the press release noted.
The briefing included an overview of FIA’s mandate and the work of FIA’s specialised units. “At the Risk Analysis Unit (RAU), the director [of] immigration explained how intelligence-led risk management is being applied to identify and mitigate threats at Pakistan’s borders,” it read.
The delegation visited the forensic laboratory, where the “lab’s crucial role in verifying travel documents, detecting forgery, and supporting litigation in travel-related offences” was highlighted. It also visited the Islamabad International Airport to “witness first-hand the enhancements made under FIA’s next-generation border control systems”.
The delegation was given a detailed briefing on the role of FIA Academy in the capacity building of its personnel and on the operations of the Second Line Border Control in detecting fraudulent travel documents and supporting front-line officers.
The visit was facilitated by the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) under the framework of a Danish-funded Rights-Based Border Management project, the press release said.

According to the data, CPI-based inflation during the same month of last year (August 2024) was recorded at 9.6pc.

attacked
a police station in Swat district, martyring one policeman and injuring two others. The attack itself wasn’t out of the ordinary — after all, Swat is no stranger to terrorist attacks. What was different about this attack was the modus operandi adopted by the militants.
Over the course of the next several days, investigators pieced together clues on the attack, which they later confirmed was carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED). “They had used an improvised explosive device, made of a power bank, which is mostly used for charging mobile phones,” District Police Officer Dr Zahidullah later
told
Dawn
.
The investigators, said Dr Zahidullah, pored over hours of CCTV footage to identify one of the militants, who in turn gave up the names of two other suspects. But the biggest breakthrough came during the course of the investigation when the militants admitted that they never used common means of communication to contact each other. Rather, they would communicate via the chat room of a popular video game, ‘Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds’, popularly known as PUBG, both to motivate new members and plan attacks. “The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” the DPO explained.
The revelation should have raised alarm bells in the power corridors: that a local affiliate of a terror outfit was using a gaming platform not only to recruit, but also to plan attacks is rather concerning, given there isn’t much law enforcers can do to access or monitor these chatrooms. However, this cat-and-mouse chase with terror outfits when it comes to the use of digital technologies has become a norm now — not just in Pakistan, but across the world.
Propaganda tool
There was a time when militants published newspapers, periodicals, posters, magazines, and distributed CDs to fuel their propaganda machinery. In recent years, however, they have become as equipped in the use of digital media as state actors, if not more.
Moreover, militants’ transnational outreach with like-minded jihadists has helped them formulate advanced propaganda techniques to counter the state narrative. This digital battle is waging at the same time as the conflict on the ground, highlighting the complexities of modern warfare, where state and non-state actors find themselves at the same level.
Of late, an interesting yet concerning trend has come to light, where Pakistani state-run social media accounts, established over the last few years, are actively engaged in posting content related to militancy, countering militant propaganda, and building a state narrative. At the same time, the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) appears to have
launched
just as many social media accounts to counter the state’s messaging.
Many of the accounts run by the terror outfit pose as news and research platforms, particularly on X (formerly Twitter). They often appear with a blue tick, which lends them more legitimacy and makes viewers more likely to follow them, who in turn believe accounts genuinely represent news and research organisations.
Recently, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, as well as several state-linked accounts on X, posted links to militants’ WhatsApp accounts, urging the platform to take down these accounts for disseminating terrorist propaganda.
In many cases, militant propaganda is as lethal as their actual acts of violence. With the advent of social media, where respective platforms struggle to distinguish between state and non-state actors, terrorists gain an advantage in exploiting local social grievances against the state, which in turn helps them with both recruitment and fund generation.
Offline vs online
Currently, every militant group, whether jihadist outfits or separatist groups like the Baloch insurgents, has dedicated propaganda teams. The TTP’s propaganda team, for example, is almost entirely focused on running the organisation’s propaganda efforts without participating in ground operations.
Following the TTP, the Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan (IMP), an emergent alliance of three Pakistani Jihadist factions, has made significant strides in its
propaganda efforts
. The latter produces high-quality, multilingual content, including infographics, videos featuring trainings and attacks, posters tailored to specific contexts and events to influence target audiences, and statements providing daily updates on attacks carried out by the alliance.
Jihadists worldwide have amply developed the ability to globalise their agenda, opening a door for anyone to be part of a “digital” jihad as volunteers. These volunteers, unable to interact physically, play key roles in propagating jihadist propaganda, viewing it as a religious duty, and do so without expecting monetary returns, instead utilising their own resources to further the jihadist cause.
In this context, the Islamic State and its regional affiliate, the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), have conducted or attempted to carry out attacks globally,
from Russia to the US,
by leveraging the power of digital propaganda to inspire others. Utilising sophisticated and hard-to-trace encrypted communications, they have expanded their reach worldwide, leaving state authorities struggling to keep pace.
This is why security analysts worldwide emphasise that winning the war of narratives is just as crucial as winning the war on the ground.
The extensive advent of social media and AI has enabled militant groups to disseminate their ideologies swiftly and widely, transcending linguistic and geographical barriers, with reduced costs and threats of being traced. This allows militant organisations to maintain a presence on the propaganda front, even if severely compromised operationally. In such situations, militant outfits’ core objective remains to inspire others through propaganda and ultimately regain lost strength.
From gaming apps to secret chat rooms
Pakistani security officials maintain that transnational jihadists have increasingly turned to
online gaming applications
as a means of secure communication, aiming to evade detection.
“After PUBG, there are indications that they are now using Ludo Star for communication to evade possible detection. Militants, particularly the transnational ones, are more tech-savvy than domestic ones. However, these transnational groups often act as trainers, sharing their technical expertise with local groups. We are faced with multi-domain threat scenarios and are battling it on a daily basis. You have to fight it both in the real world and the virtual one,” said a senior Pakistani security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to the media.
The ISKP is a prime example, which, despite suffering significant setbacks in recent years, has persisted with an intense propaganda campaign to attract fresh recruits and thereby maintain its standing as the most dreaded militant outfit globally.
The latest
report by the UN sanctions monitoring team
, based on intelligence inputs from member states, has raised serious concerns about the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and various communication platforms for propaganda and recruitment purposes, allowing terrorist groups to evade detection by state authorities.
“Both Al-Qaeda and ISIL (the militant Islamic State in Levant) continued to experiment with different communication platforms to glorify violence and promote an idealised life under their rule. ISIL tried to exploit TikTok’s reach and algorithmic power for recruitment. Al-Qaeda continued to try to exploit gaming platforms for recruitment. Once an initial contact has been made, potential recruits were directed to encrypted apps (such as Telegram, Element, Discord, Threema, or Zangi), for tasking. (These) groups also continued to experiment with artificial intelligence (AI), mostly for recruitment, and to enhance propaganda,” the report
says
.
Al-Qaeda’s propaganda tactics, utilising modern tools, then trickle down to its like-minded jihadists, such as the TTP. Al-Qaeda has long been regarded as the architect of propaganda tactics for both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban. Both ISKP and Al-Qaeda, along with the latter’s local jihadist allies, consider propaganda an integral part of their existence, just like their operational part.
A war Pakistan cannot fight alone
Militant groups have consistently outmanoeuvred law enforcement authorities on multiple fronts in recent months, employing sophisticated propaganda strategies, adapting revenue generation methods and frequently changing operational tactics in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, while the state remains entrenched in traditional approaches.
Beyond the digital outreach of militants, including the TTP and Baloch armed separatists, to their target audience in the cyber realm, a growingly alarming trend that has emerged in recent months is the increased physical accessibility of militants to locals in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, compared to state officials.
In areas with high militant concentrations, state authorities often find themselves confined to government compounds, while locals’ interactions with militants are becoming routine occurrences, causing a significant disconnect between state representatives and locals. This distance substantially benefits militants in bolstering both their physical presence and ideological outreach through preaching.
The threat posed by militancy cannot be defeated by a single country; its multidimensional nature demands a collaborative approach involving multiple nations. Even the world’s most advanced countries struggle to combat terrorism alone, so it’s unrealistic to expect Pakistan, with its meagre resources, to tackle it solo.
Furthermore, the increasing use of proxy wars, which has become a norm in the region, where militants are employed by rival states to weaken adversaries without going into direct confrontation, creates a perilous cycle. This trend prompts retaliatory measures in kind from the target state, fuelling further instability and inadvertently strengthening the militants’ threat.
If Pakistan is to effectively combat militancy, it must effectively work on building alliances with other countries in the region as well as incorporate a more transnational approach aimed at countering militants’ propaganda and digital warfare. Militants are now more adept than ever at leveraging digital technologies. It’s time the state caught up too.

airstrikes
targeting residential areas in Doha.
PM Shehbaz reached Doha today on a one-day visit, where he met Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to express solidarity and regional unity after the attacks, state media reported.
“The prime minister emphasised that Israel’s ongoing aggression in the Middle East must be stopped and the Muslim world needs unity in its ranks to confront Israeli provocations,” according to a statement by state broadcaster
PTV
on X.
The statement said the prime minister strongly condemned the Israeli attack as a “blatant violation” of Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. He stated that the leadership and people of Pakistan were deeply concerned about the attack, which was contrary to international laws.
“Reaffirming the historical and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Qatar, the prime minister said that both countries stand with each other. “In this spirit of brotherhood, Pakistan has stood shoulder to shoulder with his highness the emir of Qatar, the royal family and the brotherly people of Qatar during this difficult time.”
He assured the Qatari leadership of Pakistan’s complete solidarity and support against this unjustified provocation, statement said, adding that he also expressed deep sympathy over the loss of precious lives in Israel’s brutal and heinous attack and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
PM Shehbaz also appreciated Qatar’s “responsible and constructive mediation role” in efforts to establish peace in Gaza, stressing that Israeli actions, such as the Doha strikes, “clearly aim to undermine regional stability and jeopardise ongoing diplomatic and humanitarian efforts”.
Qatar and Egypt have been
instrumental
in US-backed att­e­mpts to hammer out a
ceas­efire
in Gaza, and have been wor­king tirelessly to help sec­ure a deal that would see prisoners being freed on both sides.
According to Hamas sources, the group’s representatives were targeted in Doha by Israel on Tuesday while they were
discussing
United States President Donald Trump’s proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza. Qatar had condemned the attack as “cowardly” and called it a flagrant violation of international law.
In today’s meeting with the Qatari emir, PM Shehbaz recalled that after the Israeli attack in Doha, Pakistan called for an
emergency meeting
of the United Nations Security Council at Qatar’s request to discuss recent developments in the Middle East.
He also welcomed Qatar’s decision to host an Arab-Islamic Summit on September 15, saying that Pakistan had expressed its willingness to co-sponsor and co-organise the summit with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
“The prime minister also thanked his highness the emir for Qatar’s strong support for Pakistan during India’s unjustified aggression against Pakistan earlier this year. The emir of Qatar thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for visiting Doha to express solidarity.
“Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination in promoting regional peace, upholding international law and supporting the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. During the visit, both leaders reaffirmed the deep brotherly relations between Pakistan and Qatar and their shared commitment to peace and stability in the region,” the statement concluded.
The prime minister later departed after wrapping up his visit. He was received earlier today and then seen off by Deputy PM and Minister of State for Defence Affairs Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman bin Hassan Al Thani.
The prime minister was accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Tariq Fatemi and others during the visit.
The Foreign Office earlier said that the visit underscored Pakistan’s “unwavering support for the security and sovereignty of Qatar and its commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East”.
Qatar and Pakistan share strong diplomatic ties, rooted in their shared faith and values.
Earlier this month, the two countries
reaffirmed
their commitment to regional peace and stability during a meeting between Pakistan’s top military official, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the Qatari military leadership on his visit to Qatar.",2025-09-11,Abdullah Momand,1099,0.000142

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942327,"Situationer: Come high water, Sindh and Punjab remain at odds - Newspaper - DAWN.COM","• Sindh officials claim discrepancies in data shared by Punjab authorities
• Punjab seeks proof, says auto and manual systems working accurately
AS THE swollen eastern rivers rage through Punjab towards downstream Sindh, there is some uncertainty about the total inflows at
Guddu Barrage
in Sindh, with different numbers circulated in the media, causing some measure of confusion.
When the rivers started overflowing last month, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had estimated that 1.3 million cusecs were expected to hit Guddu.
This claim probably came after over one million cusecs passed through Qadirabad Barrage on the Chenab River on Aug 27.
Guddu, in fact, had first passed a medium flood (390,107 cusecs on July 30) and a high flood (501,299 cusecs on Aug 23 at 12pm). On Aug 24, a peak of 510,798 cusecs flowed through at 12pm.
But statements about a ‘
super flood
’, high flows in Chenab and multiple breaches across Punjab, caused considerable consternation in Sindh.
Combined with inflows from the Indus, the amount of water heading towards Sindh was initially estimated to be around 900,000 cusecs.
These estimates were then
revised
downwards, with Sindh chief minister subsequently telling the media that a peak of 650,000 to 700,000 cusecs would be received at Guddu.
Discrepancies?

After hearing reports of discrepancies in flow data, a delegation of Sindh irrigation officials
visited
Panjnad on Sept 7.
The officials, who spoke to
Dawn
on condition of anonymity, attributed the confusion about flows to discrepancies in Punjab’s data.
They noted a difference in the gauge installed at Chacharan Bridge in Rahim Yar Khan district. The Chacharan gauge indicates river flow patterns to Sindh before they reach Guddu Barrage.
A Sindh irrigation official shared the correct reading of 11.3ft, in comparison with the 11.7ft reading shared by Punjab during monitoring. “We shared this image with our Punjab counterparts and they then corrected it. This was before Guddu attained its peak of Sept 14,” said an official.
A federal government official, who observes flows in the Indus river system outside of Sindh, seemed to agree with the assessment. “This can possibly be due to the fact that the rating table that helps understand staged discharges was not calibrated, especially at Panjnad, Islam and Sidhnai barrages,” he claimed.
A rating table is the tool used to ensure accuracy in recording stage-wise discharges, and it would appear that the tables at the concerned barrages were not updated to measure a quantum of water over 600,000 cusecs, since such high flows had not been seen here in quite a while. Therefore, an inaccuracy in the measurement of the flows cannot be ruled out.
“Rating tables were not calibrated to record a correct flow at Panjnad [875,000 cusecs designed discharge] so there remains a possibility that correct discharges weren’t shared,” the official said. In his view, there was perhaps no malafide intent behind this error, rather attributing it to administrative inaccuracy.
Another official pointed to “differences” between the automated and manual readings at Panjnad.  “We noted SCADA [Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition] had different readings (at Panjnad) while flows recorded manually were different. To us, those readings had an upward variation of 60,000-70,000 cusecs. But this was corrected when the barrage passed the peak of 600,000 cusecs on the evening of Sept 7,” he said.
‘Everything is accurate’
Officials in Punjab, however, rejected the claims made by Sindh officials, saying their automated and manual systems were accurate and that there were no discrepancies recorded at Panjnad, as claimed by Sindh.
“Please ask them whether or not they (Sindh government) have communicated this issue in writing to date? Why are they not writing to us if the discharges are more than the inflows,” Punjab Irrigation Department’s Additional Secretary (Technical) Khurram Amin told
Dawn
on Monday.
To a question, he said that a high-level delegation from Sindh, including the minister, secretary and other officials had visited Head Panjnad in recent days and checked everything, including the automated and manual reading systems.
He revealed that automated readings in high flood season vary slightly because they are recorded in real-time, so the irrigation department also relies on manual readings for accurate flows.
“To gauge the flows in the high flood season, we always use the left portion of the rivers. This spot is called a gauge well to accurately measure the flows. We chose this area since the rivers flow smoothly here, unlike the flow in the central creek and the right area, where ripples are created, making the officials unable to take manual readings,” he explained.
Rejecting the Sindh team’s claims, he questioned them to explain their observations in writing, telling which reading, manual or sensor, they are talking about. “And even if there is some difference that should not be more than 4/5000 cusecs and is very minor…must not be taken as a big issue,” he said.
Talking to
Dawn
, Faisal Mushtaq, Bahawalpur irrigation region’s Superintending Engineer, who also deals with the affairs of Head Panjnad, also disagreed with the Sindh observations. “This is very simple to check within a very short time. Gauge inflow and discharge first at Panjand (where Ravi, Chenab and Sutlej gather), then at Chachran Sharif (where these all join the River Indus) and finally at Guddu Barrage.”
“If there is any major difference in the reading at Chachran and Guddu, it means the problem exists on our part. And if there is no difference, it means the problem exists on their part,” he explained. To a question, he said the Sindh team during its visit to Panjnad didn’t express any reservations.

In the letter dated September 16, a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
, Imran expressed grievances over several matters, including the conditions he has been kept in inside jail,  and urged CJP Afridi to direct the Islamabad High Court to fix some “critical petitions” that had been “hanging in the doldrums” for hearing.
The petitions he was referring to pertain to Toshakhana and Al Qadir Trust cases.
Speaking to the media after delivering Imran’s letter, Khosa said the CJP had sought the ex-premier’s complaints regarding the conditions in jail in writing and assured that his grievances would be addressed and responded to within 24 hours.
He said, “We will inform you about whatever happens in [the next] 24 hours.”
Khosa said he had also expressed “our reservations” about the judiciary to the chief justice and raised the matter of jail reforms.
“The CJP has sought suggestions over jail reforms,” he said.
Earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum had reached the court with the PTI founder’s letter, where she was reportedly barred from meeting the CJP by police. Khosa was later allowed access to the chief justice.
The letter
Imran began his letter with complaints about jail conditions, saying: “For over 772 days, from a cage measuring 9 x 11, from a dungeon of enforced silence, isolation and incommunicado, I have endured continued solitary confinement … All access to books and newspapers has been denied to me.”
“Meetings with my lawyers and family are “arbitrarily cancelled at the whims and wishes of one man”, Imran claimed, referring to the army chief.
He also alleged that his sons were barred from talking to him on phone and political workers were also not allowed to see him.
“It is not lawful imprisonment since its inception; it is only calculated psychological torture, crafted to break my will … It is an ongoing assault on the  Constitution, the rule of law and the democratic future of my beloved homeland, Pakistan,” he continued.
The PTI founder also complained of “inhuman and degrading treatment” being meted out to his wife, Bushra Bibi, in jail, alleging that she was being denied medical treatment and access to books and television.
He pointed out that superior courts have held that “female prisoners are entitled to leniency through bail as a matter of right”.
Yet, in Bushra Bibi’s case, “this principle has been suspended”, he said.
The former premier then went on highlight that “thousands of my supporters and party workers continue to languish in jails” and had been “abducted, beaten and subjected to military trials in flagrant violation of constitutional protections”.
He also expressed grievances with regards to the “
political victimisation
” of his family members.
“Courts that should stand as guardians of liberty have been weaponised to dismantle Pakistan’s largest political party,” the further said.
Imran maintained that his PTI secured a “landslide victory” in last year’s
general elections
“despite the brutal tactics, the suppression of all bold voices, despite my own imprisonment”.
“Yet, the mandate of the people was stolen overnight, turning democracy into [a] farce and the Constitution into a casualty. The same has been sanctioned and rubber-stamped by the leaked report of Commonwealth 2024,” he wrote.
Although the Comm­on­wealth Observer Group’s (COG) report on Pakistan has yet to be officially released, news outlet
Drop Site News
claimed
that the group had “buried their report” after finding those polls to be riddled with problems.
Imran further said that “the so-called
26th Constitutional Amendment
has been used as a tool to sanctify this electoral dacoity, while
petitions
challenging it lie unheard in your (CJP’s) court”.
CJP Afridi had
ignored
a decision made last year by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full apex court, according to minutes of the communication exchange between the chief justice and two senior SC judges.
Imran also wrote about the allegedly “questionable conduct of the Islamabad High Court under its chief justice, a byproduct of the 26th Amendment; Justice Sarfaraz Dogar, who deliberately refuses to fix my Al-Qadir trust petitions and the Toshakhana revision petitions”.
“He has fully abandoned impartiality and reduced Islamabad High Court to a facilitator of unjust and tyrannical campaign against me and those associated with me,” Imran alleged. “I remind him to fulfil his oath, instead of hiding behind frivolous ‘policy reasons’ to justify not hearing my petitions.”
He then urged the CJP to direct the IHC to fix the aforementioned petitions for hearing. He added, “I, as the patron-in-chief of Pakistan’s largest political party, seeks only what the Constitution guarantees: justice, dignity and equality before law. I therefore request immediate hearings of the pending petitions before all courts. Allow all telephone calls to my sons as mandated by the jail manual, grant access to Bushra Bibi’s doctors for her medical treatment, and ultimately restore judicial independence of the judiciary in Pakistan.”
Imran concluded his letter, saying: “The courage of the verdicts you inscribe in the book of this nation’s destiny will go down in history … I urge Your Lordship to uphold the oath of your office and show the people that the Supreme Court of Pakistan remains their final refuge of justice.”",2025-09-18,Umer Mehtab,1388,0.000164

On the directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the CDA will also conduct a feasibility study of the project. The rail service will be launched from Margalla Railway Station to Saddar Rawalpindi to facilitate citizens.
Sources said utmost care is required to make this project a success, as a similar service launched in the 1990s from Margalla Station to Saddar Rawalpindi was closed within three months after being declared a failed project.
“In 1996, a train service was started from Margalla Station to Saddar (Marir), but it was closed due to a shortage of passengers, as barely two dozen passengers used to travel per trip. I still remember passengers were also provided coach and wagon services from Margalla Station, yet the desired results could not be achieved,” said an official source.
The Margalla Station is located in Sector H-9, an institutional sector.
Project aims to launch electric train with feeder bus network to improve connectivity and reduce traffic in twin cities
Meanwhile, the metro bus service is already in operation from Saddar Rawalpindi to Pak Secretariat, accommodating a large number of passengers daily.
However, officials of Railways and the CDA said that with the help of feeder bus services, the new project would be made successful. They said that instead of a traditional train, a high-speed electric train would be launched, while feeder buses would help citizens reach both stations.
Sources added that if required, Railways could extend the track from Margalla Station to 7Up Chowk, linking it with 9th Avenue, the same avenue where the metro bus service already operates.
“This service will be a success, as a number of universities and colleges are also located in Sector H-9, so I don’t think there will be any issue of ridership,” said an official.
Though the MoU has yet to be made public, many believe the CDA will import the trains and operate the service, while Railways will provide the track and handle its maintenance.
Recently, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif gave the go-ahead to Railway Minister Hanif Abbasi and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi for launching the service, with the government aiming to start operations on March 23 next year.
“Draft MoU has been finalised and hopefully it will soon be signed between Railways and CDA,” said an official after a meeting held at CDA headquarters.
The meeting, chaired by CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa, was also attended by officers of Railways.
“In line with the directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, a meeting was held to review progress on the operation of a modern and high-speed train in Islamabad and Rawalpindi,” read a press release issued by CDA.
It said the meeting was held to finalise the draft MoU for operating a train between the twin cities.
“CDA and Pakistan Railways will soon sign the MoU regarding this project. The meeting featured a detailed discussion on the contents of the MoU,” it said.
“The meeting reviewed in detail the proposed route, layout plan, optimal business model, and eco-friendly technology for the train project.”
Chairman CDA Muhammad Ali Randhawa said the completion of the train project would significantly reduce traffic flow in the twin cities. He mentioned that the train service would be integrated with feeder electric bus services to ensure easy access for citizens to key locations in Islamabad. He added that the project would provide affordable, safe and comfortable travel for citizens.

The protesters warned that if their demand was not met, they would stage a strong protest outside the deputy commissioner’s office.
Addressing the gathering, elders, including Maulana Noor Saleem, Dr Riazuddin, Johar Ali and others, alleged that contractors had been extracting precious stones from Katan mountains for the past eight years, causing environmental pollution.
They said lives of students of seminaries and schools situated just across the mountain were at risk. A day earlier, they added a huge rock had fallen on a house, but fortunately no major damage occurred.
Kohat admin launches crackdown on placer gold miners
The speakers complained that trucks weighing up to 45 tonnes, instead of the permitted eight tonnes, were plying the area daily, damaging roads. They added that natural springs had dried up and the local graveyard was also being affected due to constant mining.
The elders claimed that neither the relevant departments were taken into confidence nor public consultation was held before awarding the lease. They warned that if the ‘irresponsible mining’ was not stopped, they would shift their sit-in to the DC office and even consider boycotting national immunisation campaigns, including the anti-polio drive.
Later, the Timergara assistant commissioner visited the site, reviewed the situation and assured the residents that their grievances would be addressed.
However, the protesters announced that their sit-in would continue until their demand was accepted.
Meanwhile, the Kohat district administration launched a crackdown on illegal mining, particularly placer gold extraction, following a high-level meeting chaired by deputy commissioner Rahimullah Mehsud on Tuesday.
The meeting, attended by the police officials, assistant commissioners, representatives of the minerals and forestry departments and leaseholders, was briefed that unlawful mining was causing heavy losses to valuable resources while damaging agricultural land and the environment.
Mr Mehsud said illegal mining would not be tolerated anywhere in the district, directing law enforcement agencies to take immediate action against those involved. Officials said special teams will be formed to keep a check on the illegal practice.
Separately, minority leader and provincial advisory committee member Riaz Rahi met DC Rahimulla Mehsud and discussed issues faced by religious minorities.  He highlighted the issues, including security of worship places, implementation of job quotas and access to education and health facilities.
The deputy commissioner assured him that the administration was committed to resolving minority community’s issues on a priority basis.

serial rapist
in police custody for five days in cases pertaining to subjecting minor girls to sexual assaults.
The suspect, a fruit vendor, was arrested by the Defence police from Qayyumabad a day before.
The matter came to the authorities’ attention after one of his alleged victims managed to obtain a USB drive from the suspect, took it to a video shop for the purpose of downloading music onto it. However, the shop owner detected the presence of explicit content on the drive and informed area residents, who apprehended the suspect and beat him up before handing him over to the police.
On Friday, the investigating officer of the case produced the suspect before a judicial magistrate (South) and sought his physical custody for further interrogation.
Suspect initially booked in four FIRs for sexual assault on five children
He stated that the suspect was initially booked in four FIRs regarding rape of four girls and one boy. He added that Section 22 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, pertaining to child pornography, had been added to the case after police seized his mobile phone and a USB containing over a hundred explicit videos.
The IO requested the court to grant police custody of the suspect for further interrogation and for conducting the medical examination of both the suspect and the survivors.
After hearing the IO and examining the remand paper, the court remanded the suspect in police custody for five days and directed the IO to submit a progress report at the next hearing.
According to the prosecution, the suspect told investigators that he had moved from Abbottabad to Karachi in 2011. In 2016, he shifted to the Qayyumabad area, and started luring and trapping children around 2019. He first opened a grocery shop, and then a juice cart.
Police have claimed to have recovered a mobile phone from his custody containing hundreds of videos filmed in his room that show graphic scenes involving children.
The parents of the five victims registered four FIRs against the suspect.

flooding
from the overflowing Malir River, officials said.
With these key routes shut down, traffic was diverted to a single lane on Jam Sadiq Bridge, which caused clogging of roads across the city.
The Korangi Industrial Area was also hit hard by the traffic mess as traders said that the road closures disrupted industries’ operations by up to 30 per cent.
The situation turned worse as repair work on the Jam Sadiq Bridge left only one of its seven lanes open, which severely limited the flow of vehicular traffic.
DIG Traffic Karachi Pir Mohammed Shah told
Dawn
that rainwater from Malir River had flooded both the Causeway and EBM Road. With both roads closed and only one lane available on the Jam Sadiq Bridge, traffic blockages are inevitable, he said.
The DIG added that the district administration was working to clear the roads, but if not done by Friday, commuters should expect continued traffic chaos.
Meanwhile, Junaid Naqi, president of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry, said in a statement that the recent rains in Karachi had severely disrupted industrial activity.
Whenever it rains, industrial operations come to a standstill, and exports are delayed, he added.
Mr Naqi further said that more than half of the workers couldn’t get to the factories because roads were closed, and many stayed away due to safety concerns.
The disruption also caused delays in export orders and shipping schedules, putting the country’s foreign exchange earnings at risk, he added.
He pointed out that had the projects like an alternative road and a flyover at the Korangi Causeway and Main Korangi Road been completed on time, the crisis could have been avoided.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940026,"Nine judicial officers terminated for misconduct, corruption - Newspaper - DAWN.COM","PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court Chief Justice SM Attique Shah has dismissed from service nine judicial officers, who were restored early this year, as they were found guilty of ‘misconduct, corruption, and inefficiency’ in a fresh inquiry against them.
The dismissed judicial officers include four additional district and sessions judges Malik Amjid Rahim, Manzoor Qadir, Qaiser Rahim and Ms Riffat Aamir; four senior civil judges named Safeer Qaiser Malik, Adil Akbar Khan, Rashid Rauf Swati and Shah Hussain, and a civil judge Tasawar Hussain.
The high court had initiated disciplinary proceedings under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2011 on charges of misconduct, corruption, and inefficiency against the said officers, according to a press release issued here on Friday.
The inquiry into the charges was conducted by a PHC judge, who found the officers guilty and recommended the imposition of a major penalty.
PHC CJ imposes major penalty after inquiry
“Upon receipt of the inquiry report, the chief justice, being the competent authority, issued final show-cause notices and afforded each officer an opportunity of personal hearing,” the release stated.
“After hearing the accused officers, the chief justice found them guilty of the charges and imposed the major penalty of dismissal from service,” it concluded.
It merits a mention here that the said officers were reinstated in April this year after eight years of their removal from service orders, which were set aside last year by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Subordinate Judiciary Service Tribunal.
A notification was issued for their reinstatement by the high court stating that in pursuance of the judgment of the Subordinate Judiciary Service Tribunal of July 26, 2024, and recommendations of the administration committee of the high court given in a meeting on April 8, 2025, the competent authority (chief justice) had reinstated the said judicial officers.
However, the notification provided that their reinstatement would be without any back-dated benefits and would be subject to the outcome of de-novo inquiry proceedings against them as well as pending appeals filed by the high court before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
While terminating their services along with two other judicial officers in April 2017, the high court had announced that those judges had violated the disciplinary law.
At that time, Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi was the chief justice of the high court.
The high court had declared that after those judicial officers were found guilty, the chief justice with the concurrence of the administration committee had imposed the major penalty of removal from service on them.
Last year, the service tribunal had ordered reinstatement of 11 judicial officers, including the present nine officers and a district and sessions judge, Sardar Mohammad Irshad and an additional district and sessions judge, Abdul Hakeem Hashmi.
However, as Sardar Irshad had attained the age of superannuation and Abdul Hakeem had passed away, therefore, their names were not included in the reinstatement notification.
These judicial officers had contended before the tribunal that merely over allegations about their general reputation, social contacts and conduct they could not be removed from service.
Full court meeting
A full court meeting of the judges of the Peshawar High Court was held here on Friday under the chairmanship of Chief Justice SM Attique Shah.
The chief justice apprised the judges of the initiatives undertaken to ensure expeditious and comprehensive dispensation of justice.
He emphasised the vigorous application of information and computer technology-based solutions to address challenges relating to court and case management, enhance facilitation for litigants, and safeguard people’s fundamental rights.
The judges reaffirmed their commitment to translating the chief justice’s vision into reality within the shortest possible time.
The chief justice expressed satisfaction over the performance of the district judiciary, acknowledging both the quality and quantity of their output as well as their sense of duty and commitment.
He also appreciated the constructive role of the bar as an integral partner in the administration of justice.
He also recognised the contribution of the court staff, and said that individuals found indulging in malpractice would soon be dealt with firmly.
A comprehensive agenda comprising 20 items was deliberated upon during the full court meeting.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940603/pkmap-protests-suicide-attack-on-quetta-public-meeting,PkMAP protests suicide attack on Quetta public meeting - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"PESHAWAR: The Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) on Monday staged rallies across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa against a
suicide blast
targeting a public meeting in Quetta on Sept 2.
The Quetta gathering was attended by PkMAP chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Balochistan National Party president Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal and senior leaders of other parties.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders and workers joined protest rallies on the instructions of their detained leader, Imran Khan.
In Peshawar, a protest was staged outside the Peshawar Press Club, with PkMAP leaders Haji Inamullah and Niazbeen and PTI MNA Shandana Gulzar, leader Irfan Saleem and MPA Haji Fazal Ilahi in attendance.
Warns if its leadership targeted again, entire province will be ‘shut down’
The speakers denounced the Quetta attack as an act against democratic values and praised Mr Achakzai as a voice for the oppressed and a symbol of constitutional resistance.
MNA Shandana said that the PkMAP chief was targeted with a suicide bomber because Imran Khan had trusted him and he was making a struggle for the constitutional supremacy in the country.
She demanded those behind attacks on political leaders be exposed.
“Some forces are trying to seize the mines and minerals in Pakhtun areas, so they’re spoiling the situation to grab those natural resources,” she said.
Afzal Khan Khamosh, the central leader of the Mazdoor Kisan Party, said that unfortunately, the blood of Pakhtuns was being shed through bombs, but no one was bothered about it.
“We [Pakhtuns] say that we are peaceful people, but no one listens to us,” he said.
Addressing a large gathering in Swat, PkMAP provincial president Dr. Mohammad Ali said that such cowardly tactics could never silence Mehmood Achakzai or his party, according to a statement issued here on Monday.
He described the blast as an attack on the democratic voice of Pakhtun and Baloch nations.
Dr Ali called Achakzai a symbol of democracy and federalism in Pakistan.
“Bombs attacks are actually attempts to silence him,” he said.
In Swabi, senior deputy chairman of PkMAP Arshad Khan termed the Quetta blast part of a conspiracy to suppress progressive voices.
He warned that if PkMAP leadership was targeted again, the party would shut down the entire province in protest.
“These repeated attacks reflected a systematic effort to keep oppressed nations voiceless. They [perpetrators] want to silence Achakzai because he speaks the truth about democracy, exploitation of our resources, and the supremacy of the Constitution. Pakhtunkhwa’s streets will always echo with resistance,” he said.
In Kohat, former MPA and PkMAP senior vice president Mir Kalam said no amount of force or bombings could suppress a democratic movement.
“Achakzai is our red line. Any attempt to target him is an attack on the entire Pakhtun nation’s rights,” he said.
Protest rallies were also organised in Charsadda, Mardan and other cities of the province.

deportation
of an Afghan refugee married to a Pakistani woman, and directed National Database and Registration Authority to decide his case regarding issuance of Pakistan Origin Card (POC).
A bench consisting of Justice Wiqar Ahmad and Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel disposed of a petition jointly filed by a Pakistani national, Ms Husna, and her Afghan husband, Masood Khan, seeking directives for the government to issue the POC to him.
“Since the second petitioner is a family member of Pakistani nationals, therefore he shall not be deported till Nadra decides his case for grant of POC,” the bench ruled.
The bench also directed the petitioners to apply for registration of their Nikahnama with the village council concerned whose secretary should issue the said certificate on verifying that the nikah had actually taken place and that the nikahnama was not a mere paperwork.
Directs Nadra to issue Pakistan Origin Card to him
The bench referred to an
earlier judgment
of the high court delivered on Dec 1, 2023, observing that this matter had already been decided by this court in that judgment, where the process and method for granting such citizenship and issuance of POC were clearly explained.
Presently, several Afghan nationals married to Pakistani women and having children have applied for POC amidst the ongoing deportation drive of Afghan refugees following expiry of their ACC (Afghan Citizen Card) and PoR (Proof of Registration) cards.
The high court is also seized with scores of such petitions filed by Pakistani women seeking POC for their Afghan husbands, which serve as a permanent residence document in Pakistan.
Saifullah Muhib Kakakhel and Nauman Muhib Kakakhel appeared for the petitioners and stated that the couple was also having two children out of wedlock.
They argued that the Afghan husbands of the petitioning Pakistani women were entitled to POC under the law, as the right to family life was constitutionally guaranteed under articles 4, 9, 14 and 25 of the Constitution of Pakistan.
They further said that such marriages had resulted in children who are undisputedly Pakistani citizens by birth under Section 4 of Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951, and that the state was under a constitutional and international obligation to protect the sanctity of the family unit.
They argued that the law enforcement agencies, however, had commenced large-scale deportations of Afghan refugees after expiry of their refugee status, and that ACC/PoR cards were no longer recognised as legitimate documents for stay in Pakistan.
In such circumstances, they said Afghan husbands—despite being eligible for POC by virtue of marriage to Pakistani citizens and having children — were being subjected to deportation and harassment while their POC applications remained pending due to lengthy and cumbersome security clearance processes.
The lawyers also referred to international human rights law, arguing that Pakistan, being a signatory to international conventions such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, was obliged to ensure that family life was not disrupted arbitrarily.
They said that deporting Afghan husbands of Pakistani women with Pakistani children amounted to violation of these fundamental rights.

Smoke quickly spread throughout the building in the early hours of Sunday.
According to witnesses, young residents escaped by jumping onto the rooftops of adjoining buildings, while elderly people were rescued by Rescue 1122 staff using ladders as thick black smoke engulfed the building.
Rescue services and firefighting crews were called to the affected building, which contained residential apartments, shops and a basement parking area.
The fire erupted before dawn, and the firefighting operation continued for more than two hours.
Ten vehicles, including six fire engines and two ambulances, took part in the operation.
Panic and fear spread among residents of the surrounding areas and the shop owners in the building. Shortly after firefighters arrived, police reached the site and cordoned off the area to keep people away while the operation was underway.
Mohsin Khan, who owns a photocopier shop in the building, told
Dawn
that he lives with his brother in an adjacent building and saw smoke everywhere around the site.
“All of my copier machines, computer and other equipment have turned into ashes,” he said, adding, “my brother tried to go inside to remove the printing and photocopy machines, but I stopped him because his life was precious than the equipment.”
Another resident said more than a dozen shops suffered smoke and fire damage. However, the fire department has yet to establish the cause.
An eyewitness, Amir Shahzad, told
Dawn
that when he reached the spot, he found thick black smoke everywhere and young people running across rooftops to save themselves.
Others, he said, were rescued by Rescue 1122 staff using a long ladder.
Another area resident said Rescue 1122 had earlier distributed notices to residents and shopkeepers, urging them to keep access ways clear, maintain fire extinguishers, and adopt other safety measures.
However, no one followed up to ensure compliance. The multi-storey building had no fire extinguishing system or equipment.
It was located only a few metres from the Liaquat Road U-turn, where former prime minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in a gun and bomb attack outside Liaquat Bagh in December 2007.
The cause of the fire is under investigation.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939549/supreme-court-bar-association-for-open-hearing-of-plaints-against-judges,Supreme Court Bar Association for open hearing of plaints against judges - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: As the scheduled full court meeting of the top court is fast approaching for giving a
final approval
to the
Supreme Court Rules
, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has proposed open inquiries into complaints by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against superior court judges.
In a set of proposals, the SCBA highlighted that open hearings will not only ensure internal accountability but also reaffirm the constitutional guarantee of equality before law under Article 25 and the right to fair trial under Article 10A of the Constitution.
Once a complaint is admitted, the SJC should conduct open proceedings subject to reasonable safeguards of dignity and decorum while deciding references within a fixed timeframe, preferably six months.
The 12-page set of proposals seeking to amend the SC Rules-2025 was furnished by SCBA President Mian Mohammad Rauf Atta and senior advocate Hafiz Ehsan Khokhar and were made known to the media at a press conference on Wednesday.
Set of proposals made public ahead of SC full court meeting
Considering the adverse reaction by the top lawyer’s bodies including the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and SCBA, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi had constituted a committee under Rule 1(4) of the new rules to suggest recommendations for addressing any difficulty that may arise in giving effect to provisions of the new rules.
The proposals will be taken up by the full court on Sept 8.
The written proposals request immediate withdrawal of recent increase in court fees, setting up a timeline for lawyers representing different parties to present arguments, deciding every case filed in the Supreme Court within a year, issuing orders of court proceedings the same day and reserved decisions within a month.
According to the set of proposals, suggestions were made to ensure the implementation of legal provisions under Articles 4, 10A, 25, and 37(d) that guarantee equality before law, fair trial, and the right to inexpensive and expeditious justice.
It was noted that as SC’s sanctioned strength has been enhanced to 35 judges, including the CJP, this moment presents a unique opportunity for structural reforms.
The key reform proposals include rationalisation of court fees, stating the recent increase in court fees should be withdrawn to ensure inexpensive justice, as seen in Norway and Germany where only nominal fees were charged.
One of the proposals deals with the right of audience for counsel by ensuring uninterrupted opportunities for lawyers to present their case, similar to structured models in Norway, France and Germany, while another asked for increase in working hours and urgent benches of the court as practised in India, the UK and the US.
The right of access to justice enshrined in Articles 4 and 10A of the Constitution requires not merely the availability of judicial forums but also their effective and timely functioning, it was emphasised.
The pendency of cases before the SC that had reached unprecedented levels demands innovative approa­ches to maximise court’s productivity. One effective reform would be the extension of working hours for hearings and the creation of “late benches” dedicated to urgent matters such as bail, human rights petitions, election disputes and stay ap­­plications. Comparative practices il­­lustrate that this model has proven highly effective in other jurisdicti­o­­ns, the proposal said, adding the Su­­p­reme Court of India regularly constitutes vacation benches and late benches to address urgent relief during recess and after-hours sittings.
For Pakistan, the adoption of extended hours and urgent benches would not only address the backlog but also reinforce public confidence in the judiciary’s responsiveness, thereby fulfilling the constitutional promise that justice will be administered without delay or denial.
Another proposal stated the Arti­c­les 175 and 184 envisioned the Sup­r­e­me Court as the apex judicial auth­ority, with mandate to adjudicate ma­­tters of constitutional, tax, civil, criminal, and regulatory importan­­ce.
On cause list and adjournment of cases, the proposal asked for adopting India’s continuous listing and China’s AI-driven scheduling to curb adjournments.
It asked for the issuance of short orders the same day followed by detailed reasons, consistent with the practice in Germany, Turkiye, and France.
About digitisation, it asked for e-filing, online tracking, and automation modelled on systems in Singapore, China, and Norway.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939928/transitory-stay-of-afghan-refugees-in-pakistan-cant-be-indefinite-arrangement-fo-spokesperson,Transitory stay of Afghan refugees in Pakistan can’t be ‘indefinite arrangement’: FO spokesperson - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan on Friday said the transitory stay of Afghan refugees in Pakistan could not be an “indefinite arrangement”.
He further stated that it was Pakistan’s “sovereign right to decide who we allow into our country and for how long”.
Khan made these remarks during a media briefing, where he was asked about
Germany’s allegation
that Pakistan had deported more than 2,000 Afghan refugees who were waiting to travel to Germany.
The FO pointed out that Germany had committed to taking in a certain number of Afghan refugees and that the country had said that it took the matter of Afghan refugees seriously. He expressed the hope that “this seriousness will be translated into action, and that the German … will be expedited”.
Khan said, “We are willing to work with Germany because we have decades old relationship; on the basis of goodwill and mutual respect. We will see what we can do.”
But he also asserted that the transitory stay of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, waiting to travel to other countries, could not be an “indefinite arrangement”.
“It is our sovereign right to decide who we allow into our country and for how long. We are willing to work with our friends with empathy and with mutual understanding. But it cannot be an open-ended arrangement.”
In response to another question about the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees chief calling on Pakistan to halt the deportation of Afghan refugees amid relief activities following a deadly earthquake in Afghanistan, she FO spokesperson said: “Regarding this notion of expulsion of Afghans, I would say we have an overall policy and it is not targeting Afghans. Any person who is illegally [staying] in Pakistan will be sent back. It doesn’t matter where he or she is from. There is no targeting of Afghans.
“This is the global norm, and this is our sovereign decision regarding who do we allow to enter or stay in our country. So, any person, who’s illegal, we will repatriate that person.”
Last month, Pakistan started deporting up to one million documented Afghan refugees ahead of its deadline for them to leave, following the interior ministry’s July 31
announcement
that Proof of Registration (PoR) cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards
expired
on June 30.
“Germany should take in these refugees as soon as possible,” the spokesperson added. “Pakistani law will apply to those Afghans living here. We will decide what to do with refugees in Pakistan.”
Pakistan is not a signatory to the
1951 Geneva Convention
. Instead, it operates under the Foreigners Act, which empowers the authorities to arrest, hold, and deport foreigners, including refugees and asylum seekers, who do not possess valid documentation.
Additionally, the spokesperson said that Kabul would need to take the issue of terrorism in Afghanistan seriously, stating, “Terrorist safe havens still exist in  Afghanistan.
“Pakistan knows how to defend its territory and its people,” Khan said.
“An operation was carried out in the border area with Afghanistan against terrorists,” he added, referring to
drone strikes
allegedly carried out by Pakistan on August 28. “Afghanistan needs to stop allowing its territory to be used for acts of terrorism.”
Islamabad has repeatedly
warned
Kabul to prevent its soil from being used to stage attacks in Pakistan, and that it is fully capable of targeting terrorists who carry out such attacks.
During the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) meeting of the Council of Heads of State, members
reaffirmed
their commitment to the country’s establishment as an independent, neutral and peaceful state, free from terrorism, war and drugs, and expressed their readiness to support the efforts of the international community to ensure peace and development in the country.
“Member states reiterated that the formation of an inclusive government with broad participation of representatives of all ethno-political groups of Afghan society is the only way to achieve lasting peace and stability in the country,” the declaration said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945229,Digitising Balochistan’s finance - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"Balochistan records the weakest socio-eco­nomic indicators in Pakistan. As highlighted in the United Nations Development Programme’s Multidimensional Poverty Index Report, nearly 71 per cent of the province’s population lives in multidimensional poverty, the highest in the country.
Development outcomes in health, education, water, sanitation, and hygiene remain persistently poor, reflecting the province’s chronic underdevelopment and the urgent need for sustained policy attention. Poor management, especially Balochistan’s fiscal mismanagement, has perpetuated governance challenges, with inefficient fund allocation and under-utilisation hindering development despite increased federal transfers under the 7th National Finance Commission Award.
Balochistan has never seen full utilisation of funds in its history, except for the development budget 2024-25 when the province utilised 90pc of its funds. The federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP_ funds have unfortunately followed the same trend, wherein, historically, Balochistan has received approximately 8–10pc of the total federal PSDP allocations, often resulting in prolonged project timelines, slow releases and delayed completions.
Institutional incapacity, corruption and the province’s political economy, characterised by patronage-based politics and clientelism, have always hindered effective planning, timely execution of development initiatives and efficient service delivery.
If properly executed, the province’s digitalisation initiative could lead to increased transparency, data accessibility and resource management
In such a situation, Baloc­histan’s
recent attempts
at the digitisation of the system can be instrumental in putting the province on a path towards development and good governance.
Across the globe, digitisation of public administration has emerged as a foundation for enhancing efficiency, transparency, accountability and citizen-centric service delivery. Reco­nising this necessity, the Government of Balochistan has introduced the Digital Financial Management Information System, including the Finance GPT and E-Filing System. This initiative marks an attempt to transition towards digital governance along with the intent to reform.
Developed by the finance department under the Public Finance Management reforms, the initiative was formally launched by the Chief Minister of Balochistan Mir Sarfraz Bugti on September 16, 2025. This appears to be a potential positive step towards efficiency and regulation for development.
The initiative consists of e-filing and digital financial management aimed at streamlining financial systems and minimising bureaucratic delays and public oversight. The Finance GPT, obviously inspired by ChatGPT, is a take on the AI tool claimed to have been pioneered by the Balochistan government to understand and accordingly answer questions or prompts by individuals. The provincial public sector data, including human resources, budget, development projects and other related information, has been linked with the tool to provide a window for policymakers, officers and the common masses to seek any information they want.
This effort could be instrumental in minimising red tape bureaucracy and making civil servants accountable to the people. Above all, ease of business could become a reality for attracting investors to take part in Balochistan’s growth and development.
While the e-filing system, supported by the Finance GPT, represents a step toward e-governance, it will require continuous effort and time to fully mature; its potential to restructure governance and improve service delivery may be present, but unless decided effort is poured into the project, it may very well fall through.
However, if properly executed, the programme could display many benefits. By placing information directly in the hands of citizens, the initiative can foster greater public participation in policy formulation, budget processes, and accountability mechanisms. For policymakers, the system could become a powerful tool to collect data, conduct analysis, and make informed and evidence-based decisions in a province that otherwise suffers from a crippling lack of useable data.
In terms of monitoring and supervision, authorities could track human resource availability and performance in real time, identifying gaps and ensuring timely redressal. Furthermore, universities and research institutions could take advantage of this digital system to advance research, policy studies, and development initiatives.
The journey toward e-governance in Balochistan is not and will not be without hurdles. Scaling the system across all departments and down to the grassroots level will require overcoming deep-rooted inefficiencies, lack of capacity among lower-tier officials, resistance from segments of the civil bureaucracy and vested interest groups.
Added to this are intrinsic structural barriers such as the energy crisis and limited internet accessibility in the districts, which can slow down implementation. Addressing these challenges demands strong political will, administrative commitment, institutional strengthening, and continuous capacity building.
If pursued with consistency and determination, these reforms can transform Balochistan into a digitally enabled province where good governance, inclusive growth, and efficient service delivery can become a reality.

The development came after a Wednesday
incident
when the transgender people and participants of a music programme used “abusive language” against the police over the latter’s bid to stop the event.
The police later launched a crackdown, leading to the arrest of 226 people, including two transgender persons.
The 11-member committee comprises tehsil president of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl Maulana Abdul Samad Haqqani, religious leader Maulana Abdul Hadi, Gul Nabi Khan, president of Islahi Jirga Maneri Payyan, Bakhtiar Khan, general secretary, Bashir Khan, president, Islahi Jirga Maneri Bala, Gul Rehman, general secretary, Yasir Khan, president of Anjuman-i-Dokandaran, Swabi city, Irsalan Khan, senior vice-president, Zamin Shah Bhutto president of traders Link Road Swabi and two transgender.
Maulana Haqqani said: “We don’t want our youth to get involved in wrong activities and wish to create an environment where everyone earn livelihood with dignity and honour.”
Maulana Samad said the committee wanted transgender persons to leave the district peacefully and earn their livelihood elsewhere because as long as they lived here, music shows would be arranged, negatively impacting youth.
Yasir Khan said that in the first phase, transgender persons would ask peacefully to leave the district and if that act didn’t work, then the district police would be involved for the purpose.
“We are determined to achieve our target,” he said.
Meanwhile, the transgender persons said in a video message that they respected elders and treated everyone with respect and did not speak against anyone but the circumstances forced them to raise their voice.
They said the explusion would never happen.
They warned elders against taking the law into their own hands and said they respected and followed local norms and values while earning livelihood.
They complained that the people blamed them for their children’s act of watching their performances.
The transgender persons said they were aware of the law and the Constitution and if they were given government jobs, they were ready to stop dancing in functions.
They said that none of transgenders was involved in the sale of ice-drug or liquor but various illegal activities continued in the district, needing attention.
They said elders should look at them from the perspective of humanity as they’re part of the Pakhtun society. Meanwhile, members of the committee said that they were expected to meet in the next few days and would also hold a meeting with district police to discuss a strategy for “expelling” transgenders from the district.

A picture of the moon on September 7. — Tanveer Shahzad
According to Suparco, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are completely safe to observe with the naked eye, binoculars or telescopes.
In a press release on Saturday, the space agency had
said
that the eclipse will be visible in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe, with clear visibility expected in most regions of Pakistan if the weather permits.
“The event will start at 8:30pm and reach its maximum at 11:57pm,” the press release read, stating that the eclipse will conclude at 1:55am.
Sunday’s eclipse is also known as a “
blood moon
”, due to its red hue during the event. When the Sun, Earth and Moon line up, the shadow cast by the planet on its satellite makes it appear an eerie, deep red colour that has astounded humans for millennia.
The Moon appears red during lunar eclipses because the only sunlight reaching it is “reflected and scattered through the Earth’s atmosphere”, said Ryan Milligan, an astrophysicist at Northern Ireland’s Queen’s University Belfast.
The last total lunar eclipse was in March this year, while the one before that was in 2022. A rare total solar eclipse, when the Moon blocks out the light from the Sun, will be visible in a sliver of Europe on August 12, 2026.",2025-09-07,Dawn.com,470,9.5e-05

The
case
, which dates back to October 2016, accuses the PTI leader of possessing illegal arms and liquor after Islamabad police claimed they recovered five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol, and three tear gas shells from his car outside Bani Gala.
Gandapur has denied the police allegations, asserting that he was travelling with two licensed Kalashnikov rifles and that the vehicle contained a valid arms licence. He further claimed that the liquor bottle in question actually contained honey.
According to the court order — a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
— Judicial Magistrate Mubashir Hassan Chishti directed that the KP CM be arrested and presented in the court on September 17.
The judge issued the order after no representative appeared on behalf of the KP chief minister.
Later, however, Gandapur’s lawyer, Raja Zahoor-ul-Hassan, appeared before the court and sought the suspension of the arrest warrant.
To this, the judge said, “If you present the accused, I will withdraw the warrant,” and rejected the request.
The arrest warrant was issued under Sections 143 (punishment for joining unlawful assembly), 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon), 145 (joining or continuing in unlawful assembly, knowing it has been commanded to disperse) and 440 (mischief committed after preparation made causing death or hurt) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Sections 13 (penalty for breaching sections 4, 5, 8 and 11), 20 (power to confiscate) and Section 65 of the Arms Ordinance, 1965.
Sections 4, 5, 8 and 11 of the ordinance deal with the prohibition of the unlicensed sale and repair of firearms, the prohibition of transporting them, the prohibition of being armed without a licence and the power to make rules as to licences.
On July 19, the court
issued
an arrest warrant for the KP CM in relation to the same case, after he failed to appear in front of the judge. However, on July 29, after the KP CM made an appearance at the court, the arrest warrant was
withdrawn.
The court acknowledged that his official responsibilities as the chief minister had hindered attendance.
On the same day, outside the courtroom, Gandapur, while talking to the media, dismissed the case as “politically motivated.”
“There is nothing in this case. I wasn’t even present when it was filed, and the vehicle in question wasn’t mine,” he claimed.
“These are false, fabricated cases meant to pressure us. But we are not afraid and have always respected the law.”",2025-09-10,Tahir Naseer,685,0.000111

It added that the office “strongly rejected recent media reports alleging miscalculations in the federal audit reports, terming them entirely unfounded and misleading.”
The DAGP also denied that the reports had been released bypassing the constitutional process, which requires their submission to the president and then laying before parliament.
According to the statement, the audit reports, appropriation accounts and financial statements for the fiscal year 2023-24 were duly submitted to the president and routed through the prime minister, strictly in line with constitutional provisions and the Rules of Business 1973. “The president approved the submission, and the reports were subsequently transmitted to both houses of parliament,” it said.
The DAGP explained that as the supreme audit institution of the country, it functions under a constitutional mandate laid down in Articles 168 to 171 of the Constitution.
Article 171 states: “The reports of the Auditor General relating to the accounts of the Federation shall be submitted to the President, who shall cause them to be laid before both Houses of Majlis-i-Shoora (parliament). The reports relating to the accounts of a Province shall be submitted to the Governor of the Province, who shall cause them to be laid before the Provincial Assembly.”
The statement further said that the app­r­oval of the reports from the president was duly communicated through the President’s Secretariat on April 12, 2025. Following this, the required number of federal audit reports were printed for laying before both houses of parliament.
On the AGP’s request, the motions were included in the National Assembly’s Orders of the Day issued on August 13, 2025. However, the National Assembly Secretariat, through its deputy secretary (legislation), informed the same day that the assembly session had been prorogued. As a result, the motion for laying the reports could not be included in the Orders of the Day.
The secretariat further asked that the reports be collected from the legislation branch, with due observance of confidentiality until they are formally laid before the house. “It is further clarified that the audit reports transmitted to the Senate remain in the custody of the Senate Secretariat,” it added.
Based on this record, the DAGP said: “The news currently circulating in different sections of print media alleging miscalculations in the audit reports and claiming that these reports were returned to the Department of the Auditor-General of Pakistan by the National Assembly Secretariat are entirely unfounded and misleading.”
It stressed that the audit reports, appropriation accounts and financial statements were sent to the NA Secretariat after the president’s approval on the prime minister’s advice to lay them before both houses of parliament.
Defending the integrity of its audit findings, the AGP asserted that the reports were prepared after proper quality assurance and “did not contain any errors”. It explained that the figures cited in the media came only from the executive summary of the consolidated federal audit report for 2024-25, which is prepared as a reference document to help stakeholders access and review sector-wise findings.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943377/thousands-gather-in-swat-for-peace,Thousands gather in Swat for peace - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"SWAT: Residents of Swat on Friday announced that there would be no place for terrorists in the valley, warning that if the provincial government and police failed to expel terrorists present in the border areas of Swat and Dir, they would confront the terrorists on their own.
The announcement was made during a large public gathering held by the Swat Qaumi Jirga at Matta Chowk here under the slogan
Swat Aman Pasoon
(Swat Peace March).
Speakers included MNA Dr Amjad Ali, Swat City Mayor Shahid Ali Khan and elders Rahmat Ali Khan, Sher Badar Khan, Bahadar Sher Afghan, Ayoub Asharey, Sher Shah Khan and Mukhtar Yousafzai, Provincial minister Fazal Hakim Khan Yousafzai, PTI MNA Dr Amjad Ali Khan, MPAs Ali Shah Khan, Sultan Rom Khan and Mohammad Naeem Khan, and chairman of the Kabal tehsil council Saeed Khan were also in attendance.
Thousands of people from all walks of life showed up, filling the adjoining roads of Matta Chowk. Many participants climbed rooftops to listen to the speeches due to a lack of space. Scores of women and children also attended the march.
Warn they’ll challenge terrorists if govt fails to oust them
The speakers emphasised that today’s Swat was no longer a place where terrorists could find refuge.
They said they knew who brought terrorists to the mountains of Swat. They asked the terrorists to leave the valley to prevent a stern action by residents. The speakers pointed out that Swat had more than 7,000 policemen equipped with modern weapons but they are not authorised to launch operations against terrorists.
They said the Matta gathering should be taken as a “referendum against terrorism” as thousands of residents voted against violence.
The jirga leaders described terrorism in Bajaur and southern districts “artificial” and rejected by the people. They demanded lasting peace across the province, reminding the state that it was responsible under the Constitution to protect every citizen.
The
Aman Pasoon
gave the provincial government and police a one-month ultimatum to take decisive action against terrorists and warned that if no operation was launched within that period, protest rallies would be staged across Swat not only against terrorism but against the provincial government and police as well.
Leaders and office-bearers of political parties and organisations, including Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), joined the peace march.
According to local peace activists, the Aman Pasoon gathering at Matta Chowk was unprecedented in the region’s history. In 2022, when terrorists re-emerged in Swat’s mountainous areas, the Swat Olasi Pasoon staged a historic rally at Nishat Chowk.
Two years later, the Swat Qaumi Jirga’s peace march at the same venue was even bigger.

• House offers Fateha for APHC leader Abdul Ghani Bhat
MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Legislative Assembly on Thursday warned that, as custodian of the legal and constitutional rights of the Kashmiri people, it would crush any attempt by disruptive elements to undermine the state’s Constitution.
“The house stands firmly behind the government in thwarting every conspiracy to dissolve the geographical, constitutional and political setup of the liberated territory of Jammu and Kashmir, and reiterates its resolve that the people will not be left at the mercy of anarchist groups,” said a resolution, moved jointly by regional heads of PPP, PML-N and Muslim Conference, along with eight cabinet members from PPP, PML-N and PTI ‘forward bloc’.
The session, convened after a gap of more than 40 days, was presided over by Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar. From the six-member opposition, PTI’s Hamid Raza and Jammu Kashmir People’s Party’s sole lawmaker and its regional head, Sardar Hassan Ibrahim, attended the session.
The resolution endorsed Tuesday’s declaration adopted at a multi-party conference in Kashmir House in response to the
strike
call by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), though it referred to the body only as a “pressure group” without naming it directly.
However, Mr Ibrahim objected to the third and fifth paragraphs after Raja Farooq Haider, also among the movers, had completed its reading. Those paragraphs suggested that any forum or pressure group formed with India’s facilitation would be denied a role in decisions concerning public interest, and that the assembly fully reposed its trust in the AJK cabinet and in the steps the AJK and federal governments might take to maintain peace and curb provocation.
Mr Ibrahim argued that while subversive elements existed within the civil society alliance, branding the entire platform as an Indian creation was unjust. He recalled that the treasury had agreed to revise the contentious clauses, failing which he would not support the resolution. The chair then allowed him to read out amended paragraphs, which stated: “Any attempt to disturb the atmosphere in Azad Kashmir through any covert or overt support from India will be vigorously resisted. This house demands that the government exercise its constitutional and legal powers to take necessary measures for the restoration of law and order.”
The revised version was unanimously approved.
In another unanimously passed resolution, PPP regional president Chaudhry Yasin said the AJK legislature would not hesitate to make any sacrifice for the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law.
“This house is the supreme institution, enjoying sole rights of legislation in the interest of the state and its people. Anarchy is being spread under a conspiracy in this peaceful and sensitive region. This house assures that neither the state nor its people will be left at the mercy of mobs, and that constitutional rule will be ensured at all costs,” it read.
The assembly also adopted a resolution moved by Minister for Mangla Dam Affairs Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, paying tribute to the late All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leader Abdul Ghani Bhat, who passed away in occupied Kashmir the other day. The house offered Fateha for him and other martyrs from armed forces as well as those who lost lives in recent floods.
Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq and PML-N regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir, speaking on the floor, congratulated the government of Pakistan for its defence pact with Saudi Arabia, saying it would go a long way in ensuring regional peace and stability and serve as a deterrence against Israel and India.
Other resolutions lauded the armed forces for their performance during escalations with India and operations against terrorists, condemned Israeli aggression in Gaza and its attack on Qatar, and decried atrocities in occupied Jammu and Kashmir.

: “The arrested leaders of the BYC were presented before Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen of Quetta ATC -1, who extended their physical remand in police custody for 15 more days on the police’s request,” adding that apart from Mahrang, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Gulzadi and Beberg Baloch were presented in the court as well.
The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Its chief Mahrang, along with other BYC members, was
arrested
on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”. The arrests were made a day after the group faced a
police crackdown
while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
Mahrang was taken into custody under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order —  for a period of 30 days (first term). Thereafter, her detention was
extended
for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a
fourth extension order
, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
Following their detention under the MPO,
cases were also registered
against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.
While in custody, Mahrang and other BYC leaders’ remand has been extended multiple times.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942351/reviving-the-rural-economy,Reviving the rural economy - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE recent floods have resulted in misery, displacement, death, loss of property and livestock,
crop destruction
and damage to infrastructure.
While the total losses are yet to be calculated, it is critical to understand their economic repercussions and the urgent need to initiate damage limitation measures.
The
2022 floods
, which affected only Sindh and Balochistan, had displaced 33 million people, submerged their homes, destroyed livestock and crops and damaged infrastructure including the irrigation network. That deluge killed over 1,100 people and caused economic losses to the tune of $30 billion, or 10 per cent of GDP. Clearly, global warming has taken firm root in the form of droughts, glacier melt, floods, torrential rains, heatwaves and rising sea levels. Our response capacity must match the challenge.
No other economic sector has such strong backward and forward linkages for national well-being as agriculture. The situation, therefore, requires a holistic rather than a narrow sectoral approach. In the immediate term, the IMF’s ongoing review warrants a revision of performance indicators and structural benchmarks in light of projected changes in the underlying variables. At least, seven important linkages can be identified.
GDP growth rate: Although agriculture’s direct contribution to GDP is only 23pc, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, transportation and storage and other ancillary services rely on its inputs such as raw material, processing, marketing, distribution of crops, livestock, dairy, fruit and vegetables, pulses, oil seeds, etc. A guesstimate of this indirect contribution would add another 25pc arising from these non-agricultural activities. Thus the rate of GDP growth rate is highly dependent not only on agricultural performance but also allied activities. Together, they account for 50pc of the economy.
Employment: The proportion of labour force employed directly on the farm is almost 37pc, including non-farm incomes. A rough guess is that about 60-70pc of total employment can be attributed to the rural economy. A significant drop in rural employment would result in a decline in purchasing power and the increased incidence of poverty.
What steps should be taken to minimise the impact of flood losses?
Inflation:
Shortage of grains, vegetables, pulses, and
disruption of the supply chain
would
push up
the consumer price index causing inflationary pressures. Coming on top of rising wheat flour and sugar prices the likelihood of higher inflation in the months ahead cannot be ruled out.
The lowest income quintile spends about 40pc of their income on food. Floods would thus hurt the poor who cannot afford higher food prices.
Poverty and income distribution:
Income poverty estimates show that rural poverty is 28pc compared to 11pc in the urban areas. Income distribution is also skewed in favour of the big landlords.
The recent agriculture census shows that the top 4pc of landholders own one-third of the total farm area while the bottom 80pc of farmers possessing less than five acres own another third, with the remaining one-third belonging to medium landholders. Negative changes in poverty headcount and income distribution are the result of flood losses.
Exports:
Eighty per cent of Pakistan’s merchandise exports derive their raw material, such as ginned cotton, husked rice, leather and food products, from rural sources. Cotton and yarn are already being brought from abroad. This volume is likely to rise in the floods’ aftermath, affecting our current account balance.
Food security and nutrition:
In Pakistan, 38m people face moderate to severe
food insecurity
(18pc of children are malnourished). These numbers must have risen after the floods.
Wheat is the main crop in Pakistan — thus, policies and incentives for sowing on a greater area during the coming Rabi season should be assured through a coordinated federal-provincial strategy.
Output of manufactured goods:
The production of goods such as motorbikes, bicycles, fertilisers, pesticides, tractors and other farm equipment as well as light consumer items are dependent on the demand of rural household. The manufacturing sector is already under stress and a drop in demand is likely to result in decreased production, shedding labour and intensifying unemployment and poverty.
What steps should be taken to minimise the impact of flood losses in the short and medium term?
Provide farmers with less than five acres of land access to good quality certified seeds, fertiliser and pesticide at subsidised rates through
Kissan Cards
; 2) use the BISP database to identify affected households for additional
cash transfers
; 3) accelerate agriculture credit disbursement and reschedule payments of old, outstanding
loans for small farmers
; 4) set up mobile veterinary services in areas where
livestock
has suffered most; 5) conduct an audit of national waterways to clear
riverbeds
and pathways of
encroachments
, and develop shelters on elevated land for residents of low-lying areas; 6) prepare projects for strengthening
embankments
and flood protection works, desilting channels, and managing afforestation and soil conservation; 7) encourage
contract farming
between the processors, extractors and buyers of commodities and the producers to ensure stable and predictable prices; 8) minimise conveyance losses by lining water courses and promoting
drip and sprinkler
, instead of flood, irrigation. Pres­e­n­tly, only 41MAF out of 145 MAF of water from the Indus irrigation system reaches the crops; 9) rehabilitate, restore and expand wetlands, develop
small dams
and reservoirs to store rainwater, recharge groundwater storage in farms, and promote the use of solarised tube wells; 10) allocate funds for R&D institutions to
develop seeds
resistant to heat, drought and cold temperatures, which can withstand pest and disease caused by climate change; 11) incentivise the private sector to invest in warehousing, storage and
cold chain facilities
and refrigerated vans; 12) while
wheat trade
should be deregulated, the provinces should hold strategic reserves for release in lean months when prices rise.
Inter-district movement
and fixed flour and end-product prices should be discouraged. Allowing imports and exports should depend on the situation.
As the
National Water Policy 2018
recommends, an integrated water resource management system that takes into account surface water conveyance, groundwater recharge and usage, drainage, flood protection works, barrages, drinking water, industrial water needs and water conservation should be established.
As I’ve pointed out previously: ‘the changing weather patterns will significantly affect temporal distribution and availability of water in the coming decades and accelerated melting of glaciers and overloading of rivers will affect food, water and energy security, posing a grave threat to living standards’.

In an announcement here on Tuesday, the Supreme Court clarified that a letter regarding provision of security to retired SC judges, which was addressed to the secretary interior, has revised its security protocols to the extent of widows of retired judges. The inclusion of the widows in the letter was inadvertent, the announcement clarified, adding that the reference to widows has accordingly been withdrawn since they were not covered under the Presidential Order No 7 of 2018.
However, the apex court reaffirmed that retired SC judges remain entitled to lifetime security strictly in accordance with the presidential order and the applicable rules and protocols. This entitlement reflects the sensitive nature of their past office and the continuing security concerns that accompany it, the announcement explained.
On September 13, the court had
announced
that the SC, in a bid to streamline and rationalise the security of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, had scaled down the number of official vehicles from eight to two, resulting in the release of a considerable number of security personnel for routine policing duties.
The security regime for serving judges has also been regulated suitably, making it rational and aligned with the entitlements under the rules. In the same spirit, the security for retired SC judges has also been regulated in accordance with applicable rules, established security protocols, and entitlements, including the relevant presidential order that provides lifetime security to retired judges, considering the sensitive nature of their past office and continuing security concerns.
In order to operationalise these security protocols, without conferring any extraordinary benefit, added concession or privilege, a circular has been issued to scale down deployment of force in excess of entitlement, reaffirming compliance with rules, and to facilitate coordination between the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Interior, and provincial authorities for implementation.

Flood-affected
communities in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), particularly in  Ghizer district, are facing a growing mental health crisis, prompting the regional government to plan psychological rehabilitation efforts in the disaster-hit areas.
According to mental health professionals, a rising number of individuals from flood-affected regions have reported trauma-related psychological issues, highlighting the urgent need for post-disaster mental health support.
Israruddin Israr, a social activist from Ghizer and the regional coordinator for the Human Rights  Commission of Pakistan, told
Dawn
that mental health issues have been widely reported in areas severely affected by recent floods. “The suicide rate in Ghizer is concerning and may be linked to trauma from past disasters,” he said.
Experts note that displacement and direct exposure to disasters often result in psychological stress and trauma. Mr Israr cited findings from a study conducted in Bubar Valley,  devastated by floods in 2022, where many children began exhibiting symptoms of trauma whenever it rained. “They would cry and be unable to sleep, haunted by the memory of the disaster,” he explained.
GB govt plans joint efforts for psychological rehabilitation in disaster-hit areas
Mental health symptoms often emerge weeks after the initial disaster, and Mr  Israr pointed out that the government has historically failed to prioritise mental rehabilitation for affected populations. During the recent floods, around 5,000 people were displaced in Ghizer alone. Many of them are now showing signs of psychological distress.
The GB government has acknowledged the problem, noting that flood victims — particularly children, women, and the elderly — are suffering from serious psychological challenges as a result of the disaster.
To address these issues, a high-level meeting, chaired by Additional Secretary for  Social Welfare Arif Tahseen, decided to devise a coordinated strategy for psychological rehabilitation in flood-hit areas.
The additional secretary noted that the recent floods had caused not only physical and economic devastation but also deep emotional and psychological damage.

The concerns were raised during events held in the capital on Thursday to pay tributes to Nisar Osmani and CR Shamsi, two veteran journalists and trade unionists, who fought for press freedom and journalists’ rights during martial law regimes.
At a seminar at the National Press Club, current and former office-bearers of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) and Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists (RIUJ) paid tribute to
Nisar Osmani
and
CR Shamsi
, highlighting their struggles for a free press.
Another event was held outside the
Dawn
offices where the journalists, politicians and rights activists also held a candlelight vigil to pay homage and remember the two trade union leaders.
The speakers emphasised the need for unity among journalists to collectively resist the government’s measures to suppress freedom of expression. They also vowed to resist the curbs in media and put up struggle against the controversial laws, such as the recent amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, known as Peca.
The speakers noted that the current climate of fear and intimidation was stifling independent journalism, with many reporters facing harassment, abduction, and assault for doing their job. They were of the view that a free press was essential for a functioning democracy.
The speakers highlighted that late Osmani was a vocal critic of authoritarian governments, especially General Zia Haq’s dictatorship, when most voices were silenced, and he advocated consistently for press freedom, democracy, and civil liberties, even at great personal risk.
The speakers also expressed concerns over the closure of roads leading to the NPC and also termed it an attempt to “besiege” the journalists.
Those who attended the two events included PFUJ president Afzal Butt, former secretary general Nasir Zaidi, NPC president Azhar Jatoi, RIUJ president Tariq Virk, senior journalists Fauzia Shahid, Asif Bashir Chaudhry, Mubarak Zeb Khan, Tariq Usmani, former NPC president Shakeel Qarar, head of the PPP Human Rights Cell Farhatullah Babar, and information secretary Tariq Ghouri.

Dawn
has learnt.
The accused, a 26-year-old young man, had been
arrested
on October 30 last year on blasphemy charges.
Despite police taking permission from the court for the medical examination of the accused on November 4, 2024, official lethargy delayed the process, with the officials of the Jhelum Jail taking more than nine months to write to the medical superintendent (MS) of the hospital for the mental examination.
According to the documents, the superintendent of the Jhelum Prison had written a letter to the MS of the hospital on July 23 seeking constitution of a medical board.
The three-member medical board, comprising a consultant psychiatrist, a senior clinical psychologist and a senior official of the institute, conducted mental examinations of the accused on August 5 and August 18.
According to the medical report, the medical board examined the accused thoroughly and advised some lab tests, the results of which are still awaited.
The board stated that “the accused is suffering from Bipolar Disorder Type I, a remitting and relapsing psychiatric disorder characterised by multiple episodes of mania and depression with intervening periods of remission.”
The family of the accused man and some neighbours had claimed at the time of his arrest that the accused was mentally-retarded.
The poverty-stricken family couldn’t hire a lawyer, and a state-appointed lawyer has been assigned to the case. The family has also been struggling to visit the accused in Jhelum prison due to financial constraints.
The accused’s mother, who was in good health before her son’s arrest, is now confined to her bed with multiple health issues. The family is worried about the accused’s condition, which they believe is worsening, and are seeking proper treatment and care for him.
“We have visited him [the accused man] in the prison hardly for four times as we could not afford to visit him on every Thursday due to our poor financial condition,” said the younger brother of the accused while talking to
Dawn
, adding that they paid last visit to the accused a month ago.
When this correspondent inquired the woman about the condition of her jailed son, she started crying.
“We do not know whether he is being treated and looked after as recommended by the medical board. We are not even aware of his medical report as I could not access it”, said the younger brother.
The state-appointed lawyer said he hadn’t visited the accused yet, and the trial couldn’t commence without the forensic report of the video, which is still pending.

Dawn
on Sunday.
Dr Rasool said that previously, the possession of these endemic (local) parakeets, like
rose-ringed
, which are comparatively smaller, was banned.
He says that the department has legalised captivity of four parakeet species, which are endemic to Pakistan, through licencing and registration.
These species include rose-ringed (psittacula krameri),
Alexandrine
(psittacula eupatria), plum-headed (psittacula cyanocephala) and grey-headed (psittacula finschii).
He says that exotic species like African grey, Macaw etc have not been been covered by any separate licencing procedure.
For the parrots kept at home, the licence fee will be Rs1,000 per bird per annum, while for the breeders having farms on three marla to one kanal land, to be registered as ‘small cottage breeders’, the fee would be Rs30,000 annually. Those having land above 1 kanal would be registered as ‘large cottage breeders’ and they will pay a Rs50,000 annual fee, Dr Rasool says.
All parrots, he says, whether licenced or registered, shall be ringed with a unique code by the department. The wild population of these parrots shall remain protected under schedule 3 of the
Punjab Wildlife Act
and no one would be allowed to capture or net these parakeets, he adds.
He says that the possession fee for the parakeets has been notified, while a detailed mechanism is to be announced very soon.

report
from the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) on polio.
According to GPEI, the report hi­­gh­lighted the geopolitical shifts imp­acting all global health efforts, inclu­ding the GPEI.
“The programme agrees with the IMB that the reduction in historic donor support — if realised — will create new challenges.
In response, the GPEI is identifying ambitious, operational shifts that will help countries fully leverage and align more limited resources to address the resurgence of wild poliovirus in the final endemic countries and counter longstanding barriers to reaching children with polio vaccines in subnational regions facing humanitarian crises,” it stated.
“The IMB rightly recognises the challenges in Pakistan and Afghan­istan that drove a surge in transmission in 2024. Each national programme — alongside the GPEI Technical Ad­­v­isory Group — has developed tailored strategies to address persistent risks and obstacles. This includes building trust with communities and frontline workers to address vaccine hesitancy, implementing tactics to reach children in hard-to-access areas, strengthening monitoring mechanisms, and continuing to collaborate closely with local authorities to strengthen cross-border coordination and disease surveillance efforts,” it stated.
IMB report highlights geopolitical shifts impacting all global health efforts
“The GPEI agrees with the IMB’s emphasis on renewed political commitment and improved accountability measures to help facilitate rapid, high-quality outbreak response effo­rts. Regional planning and cross-border collaboration are critical to containing virus spread in outbreak cou­ntries.
For example, a comprehensive Lake Chad Basin coordination plan has received support from seven key countries that aims to synchronise ca­­mpaigns, enhance surveillance activities, and reach mobile and border po­­pulations. Countries in the Horn of Africa and Yemen are also ta­­king co­­ncrete steps to intensify co­­or­dination to end protracted variant po­­­liovirus spread in this bloc,” it stated.
“Integrating polio services with other health programmes will help boost overall immunity and meet the bro­a­der health needs of communities now. In 2024, the GPEI’s integration efforts were strengthened, with more than 40pc of campaigns delivering ‘plu­­ses’ — other childhood vaccines, nutritional supplements, or other health interventions.
“The GPEI is also working with ministries of health and Gavi to boost IPV coverage and support country efforts to improve routine immunisation and integrated delivery systems — a cornerstone of the eradication strategy,” it stated.
“GPEI values the IMB’s ongoing oversight and its shared dedication to eradicating polio worldwide. The programme is carefully reviewing each recommendation and will provide a comprehensive response. We will continue working closely with the IMB, affected countries, and partners to enhance the programme’s effectiveness — strengthening immunisation efforts, mainstre­aming gender-sensitive approaches, refining disease monitoring, reinforcing health systems, and ultimately ensuring that no child is paralysed by polio ever again,” the GPEI stated.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944687/govt-closes-last-afghan-refugee-camp-in-mianwali,Govt closes last Afghan refugee camp in Mianwali - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: The federal government has denotified the last Afghan refugee camp in Mianwali as Punjab claims to have
repatriated
around 42,913 Afghan nationals since April 1, 2025.
The Punjab government had set up holding centres under Pakistan’s Illegal Foreigner Repatriation Plan (IFRP) and began identifying Afghan nationals who lacked valid documents or had overstayed in Pakistan for more than a year.
Undocumented Afgh­ans were placed in these holding centres until they were transported to the Torkham border for crossing into Afghanistan.
Punjab Home Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi told
Dawn
that no Afghan refugee camp was operational in the province following the closure of Mianwali’s Kot Chandna camp. He said that Afghans intercepted by law enforcement agencies were taken to district-level holding centres, where the Punjab government, through deputy commissioners, provided board, lodging and food. From there, they were transported to Torkham at the government’s expense.
“All Afghans residing in Pakistan have to leave except those holding valid visas,” he asserted.
According to the UN refugee agency, more than 3.5 million Afghans were living in Pakistan, including some 700,000 who arrived after the Taliban
takeover
in 2021. About half of them were undocumented.
While Pakistan hosted Afghans for decades during successive conflicts, the government argued that the rising number of refugees posed security risks and strained public services. Following the repatriation policy, many Afghans voluntarily left the country, while others were identified, taken to holding centres, and later transported to the border.
In its notification denotifying the Mianwali camp, the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and States and Frontier Regions said all land and non-movable assets in the area would be handed over to the Punjab government or the district deputy commissioner concerned by the respective Provincial CAR through written handover.

Aunty Sonnu
in the twilight of the Zia years, through my friendship with her youngest daughter, Laila Rahman. What began as her good-humoured acceptance of a young outsider in her home, gradually deepened into a bond of genuine connection, moored in three common passions: a profound love for Laila, her youngest, most passionate and creative child; a deep attachment to Lahore; and an enduring affection for Government College — the institution that shaped so much of who she became.
After Laila and I wed, that bond grew into a shared life. Together, we weathered seasons of joy and passages of grief, during which I came to understand the many worlds she gracefully inhabited. She was Babijan to her husband’s family in Mardan, Aunty Sonnu or Sonnu Khala to friends and relatives, and Mrs Rahman to the generations of students she guided and mentored.
Sohni Sondhi was born, raised, and educated at Government College, where her father, Professor G.D. Sondhi, taught. It was within those familiar halls that she met Abdul Rahman Khan and entered into a bond so profound that she embraced Islam and left her beloved Lahore to marry him, making a new home in his ancestral town of Mardan.
There, she found belonging, forming lasting ties with both family and community. She became fluent in Pashto, bridging a language divide that still fragments our communities today. Through all these years, she remained a voracious reader and gifted storyteller — a passion she passed on to her children, her grandchildren, and to the many young people she encountered.
While much is being written about the many journeys that defined her life, I wish to reflect on Mrs Rahman, the educator. The truest way to honour her, I believe, is to pause and ask what her life reveals about the mission of education in Pakistan; a cause she served with rare distinction.
When questions mattered more than answers
To grasp the scale of her impact on generations of young people, we must first return to her own educational beginnings at Government College Lahore in the mid-twentieth century. At the time, the College was more than an academic institution — it was a bastion of the humanist tradition, dedicated to preparing its students for the responsibilities of civic life.
Its mission extended beyond the narrow confines of disciplinary instruction, insisting instead on the cultivation of eloquent speech and writing, the practice of persuasive and reasoned argument, and the habits of critical and creative thought. Students were trained not only as specialists in their fields but also in the arts of debate, literature, and performance, with a special emphasis on drama.
The humanist tradition came alive through pioneering teachers like A. S. Bokhari, Sufi Tabassum, Thapar, Sirajuddin, Verma, Latif, Chawla, Kashyap, and G. D. Sondhi. They believed education was not about cramming facts but about sparking ideas. Their classrooms buzzed with debate, where students learned to think independently and creatively and teachers welcomed being challenged in turn.
Their pursuit was never about teaching to the test; it was its outright rejection, a refusal to reduce education to rote drills and mechanical instruction. Instead, they fought to nurture curiosity, imagination, and the courage to question and create: the very qualities that exam-driven schooling, with its drills and memorisation, so often drains from young minds.
They also instilled in their students the value of tolerance. The College’s student body, though drawn largely from the elite, was a blend of ethnicities, sects, and faiths. Within its classrooms, differences were respected and coexistence was treated as a principle to be embodied rather than preached. They offered a striking counterpoint to the narrow and exclusionary forces that, then as now, work to fracture our society.
A legacy written in minds, not titles
Mrs Rahman realized the very spirit of this tradition, never more alive than when she was with her students. Although she took up teaching at the age of 60, for her it was never a job, it was a vocation. She taught history, not as a set of dates and facts but as a living story of how societies evolve and how those shifts have shaped human lives.
Beyond the classroom, she was an avid explorer travelling to historic sites, wandering through museums, and seeking out conversations with scholars and fellow travellers. What she discovered, she carried back to her classroom —  every journey fed her passion for teaching and became a story to share. In this way, she gave her students more than lessons; she gave them a sense of wonder.
The classroom was her canvas, and her students the co-creators. Her vitality and love of learning made her not just a devoted teacher, but an unforgettable one. She embodied the very curiosity, wit, and spirit of tolerance and coexistence that she sought to awaken in her students.
Her education in the humanist tradition at Government College paved the way for this vision. It gave her a lifelong resolve to transcend the boundaries of narrow disciplinary instruction, putting language, argument, and the art of critical thought at the heart of education.
As a founding faculty member of the Lahore College of Arts and Sciences (LACAS), she spearheaded the revival of debates and theatre at the school level — a bold undertaking during Zia’s authoritarian era, when censorship stifled expression and the humanities languished in once-vibrant institutions like Government College.
At LACAS, she helped equip students from diverse backgrounds with the tools of creative and critical thought. Her efforts culminated in the revival of debating at the national level, nurturing a new generation of students who went on to distinguish themselves in remarkable ways. And she did it all from the ground up, through unrelenting effort within the strictures of the system.
The outpouring of messages from her former students and mentees till date, stands as a quiet testament to those efforts. She changed lives, without holding high office or title in the education system, but through sheer passion for learning and kindling in others the joy of questioning, discovery, and expression.
How learning has become an atomised enterprise
Yet, ironically, instead of building on such examples, much of the global education system has moved in the opposite direction. It has become increasingly grade-obsessed, killing the desire to learn and narrowing horizons at the expense of the broader critical skills essential for civic life. Teachers are reduced to functionaries, bound to pre-set rubrics, stripped of the autonomy to shape learning.
The rise of exam-driven academies and limited subject choices have left scant space for the study of languages, rhetoric, and the art of critical and creative thought. In the process, education has been hollowed into an atomised enterprise — alienating both teachers and students from the pursuit of knowledge, and producing citizens deprived of the very skills needed to question, to challenge, and to imagine alternatives.
What Mrs Rahman’s legacy as an educator makes clear is that Pakistan’s much-touted rise as a “knowledge economy” will remain an empty claim unless we build a culture that truly empowers teachers who value the enterprise of learning and the production of knowledge. Education must prepare the young to question, to create, and to step confidently into public life.
Seen against this backdrop, Mrs Rahman’s example shines all the more brightly: she embodied a humanist tradition, and through her life and work, offers a living reminder of what education in Pakistan could, and should, be.",2025-09-12,Ali Cheema,1920,0.000204

to Palestine’s Gaza, where Israel continues its offensive.
Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, who signed the agreement on Pakistan’s behalf with the Ambassador of Palestine Dr Zuhair Dar Zaid, remarked during the ceremony: “The purpose of this agreement is to foster closer collaboration for improving the health and well-being of the people of both brotherly nations.”
According to a press release by the health ministry, the ceremony was attended by Secretary of Health Hamid Yaqoob, the additional secretary of health and the director general.
Highlighting the details of the agreement, Kamal said, “A Pakistan-Palestine Health Working Group will be established within the next 30 days to oversee the implementation of the agreement and provide guidance for practical collaboration.”
The key areas of cooperation between the two countries under the agreement will focus on “enhancing capacity in advanced medical fields such as interventional cardiology, organ transplantation, orthopaedic surgery, endoscopic ultrasound, burn and plastic surgery”.
“Joint efforts will also be pursued in the fields of infectious diseases, ophthalmology, and pharmaceuticals,” the press release quoted Kamal as saying, adding that “opportunities for collaborative research will be explored.”
Underscoring Pakistan’s commitment to supporting Palestine, Kamal assured the Palestinian ambassador of continued support to “Palestinian brothers and sisters in the field of health.”
“The hearts of the people of Pakistan beat with Palestine, and we stand ready to assist them in every possible way,” he added.

The BYC chief is currently in police custody on
physical remand
, which was extended for 15 more days by an ATC in Quetta on Thursday. Mahrang was arrested on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence” and has been remanded several times.
According to a copy of today’s court order available with
Dawn.com
, the state prosecutor “vehemently” opposed the court granting bail to the BYC chief because the allegations against Mahrang are of a serious nature and the investigating officer collected sufficient evidence which could be presented in court.
Last October, Mahrang was
booked
in a terrorism case as a first information report (FIR) was registered by Malir district’s Quaidabad police on the complaint of a local resident who claimed that the BYC leader was inciting violence in his area.
“She (prosecutor) further argued that the accused has incited hatred against state institutions, and spread seditious material with [the] intent to cause public unrest. Therefore, [the] accused is not entitled for the concession of bail,” the order read.
The order added that the complainant in the October FIR did not produce any independent witnesses to corroborate the allegations, nor did he appear in court despite the investigating officer (IO) being instructed to produce him.
“Moreover, during [the] investigation at the time of visiting place of incident, neither [the] IO called any private/independent witness from [the] locality nor made [any] query from area people regarding alleged incident,” the order read.
The order added that the IO submitted a report to declare Mahrang an absconder in the case, but the defence counsel submitted the Quetta ATC’s remand order, which showed that she is in police custody.
“Moreover, FIR regarding alleged incident was registered against the applicant/accused on October 11, 2024, while [the IO] submitted [a report] before [the] … Anti-Terrorism Courts Karachi Division on August 16, after the delay of 10 months and in this regard IO has not furnished reason why he submitted [a report] against the accused after delay of 10 months,” the order read.
“In view of the above, I have come to the conclusion that [the] applicant/accused has made out her case for further enquiry,” it added, quoting the ATC judge. “Therefore, I hereby admit the applicant/accused on bail subject to furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs100,000 in the like amount to the satisfaction of this court.”
Mahrang was taken into
custody
under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order — and remains in custody.
Following her detention under the MPO, cases were also
registered
against her and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.

Sources said that a cle­arance operation was bei­ng carried out in the Matta area when the clash took place, adding that two personnel lost their lives in the exchange of fire.
The clearance operation was carried out in the Dopsar area, a hilly part of Matta tehsil, they said, adding that the operation was conducted on reports of the presence of militants in the area.
Sources said the area was cordoned off immediately and a search operation was launched. Howe­ver, there was no official word from the military’s media wing, until going to press.
A security official confirmed the presence of up to 60 militants, including their support network, in Khawazkhela and Matta tehsils of Swat.
He said the militants had first appeared in the area in 2022, but withdrew after the Aman Pasoon (peace uprisings), and had only now returned to the area.
He added that since the militants were present on hilltops and could spot the movement of security for­ces from the heights, flu­sh­­ing them out was a challenging job. Besides, their ability to monitor troop mo­­vements was also enabling them to plan ambushes.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1938766/flood-prone-housing-schemes-along-ravi-rife-with-irregularities,‘Flood-prone’ housing schemes along Ravi rife with irregularities - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: The area declared as “prone to floods” by the Punjab irrigation department is rife with violation of rules and regulations, absence of requisite infrastructure as well as weak enforcement led to the
massive devastation
in private housing schemes along a long stretch of River Ravi in Lahore.
The rules defined for the approval of private housing schemes by various authorities are either not being implemented or enforced when it comes to the area prone to floods.
In recent days, billions of rupees of residents have been lost in various housing schemes and katchi abadis after floodwater entered their houses and business premises. This area comes under the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project being executed along a 46km long stretch of Ravi by the Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda).
There is also a disparity in the approval mechanism between different authorities, especially Ruda. The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) follows the Private Housing Scheme Rules 2014 (updated), under which (rule-7) says the land proposed for any housing scheme or land subdivision cannot be approved if it doesn’t fulfill certain requirements. One of them is that the land must be out of the flood-prone area. The tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) also follow the same rules in areas within their jurisdictions.
Disparity muddies the water in different authorities’ approval mechanisms
But on the other hand, Ruda — an authority having territorial jurisdiction carved out in 2020 by the then PTI-led government covering a 46km stretch along the river with 132,000 acres and 960 sq-km land — interprets its Ruda Private Housing Scheme Rules 2021 differently. However, it has the same conditions for the approval of housing schemes as the LDA or TMAs.
“It is very confusing that Ruda may accord approval to housing schemes in flood-prone zones without an NOC from the irrigation department. But the LDA and TMAs don’t approve schemes if its land exists in flood-prone regions identified by the irrigation department,” wonders an official source in the Punjab government.
The recent flooding in various housing schemes approved by Ruda shows that if its own rules were followed in true letter and spirit, the massive devastation seen in various approved and unapproved housing schemes could have been averted.
“I think Ruda’s focus is on approving and regulating housing schemes instead of on one of its most important jobs i.e. building river training works, embankments, barrages, river channelisation among others. In my opinion, Ruda should have developed the aforementioned infrastructure first and then accorded approval to housing schemes,” deplores an officer, who requested not to be named.
“I am really surprised as to how the housing schemes in Ruda, which already exist in the flood plains as per the irrigation department, can be developed,” he said. He also criticised LDA and TMA for keeping mum on the mushroom growth of housing schemes, mostly illegal, in the flood-prone areas near Ravi before the existence of Ruda. “Why had the LDA and TMAs failed to stop such malpractice?” he questioned.
However, an LDA officer, on the condition of anonymity, claimed the authority had taken stern action against illegal housing schemes. “We took very serious action against various housing schemes in the past. These included declining approval for illegally extending portion of a housing scheme on the Multan Road. Similarly, we carried out several demolition operations in another illegal housing scheme near Chuhng on Multan Road,” he argued.
A spokesperson of Ruda, when contacted, said, “Ruda, having land in Lahore and Sheikhupura, inherited as many as 103 illegal housing schemes and land subdivisions from LDA and the TMAs. Besides these there were some other schemes that already had approval for a phase or the initial piece of land measuring 100, 200, 300 kanals, but hadn’t obtained approval for their extensions. Such societies developed extensions unlawfully that showed weak enforcement by their then regulators”.
When asked about development of housing schemes in the area prone to flooding, he claimed that the ongoing river training works and embankments would completely eliminate the risks of floods. He said the authority also bound developers to ensure construction of flood protection embankments on their before giving them the final approval.
On the question of giving approvals to housing schemes without the NOC from the irrigation department, the spokesman said, “There is no need for an NOC from the irrigation department as the authority gives approval as per its master plan that guarantees safeguards from floods.”
The spokesperson said that despite Ruda inheriting already existing housing schemes, its teams were doing their best to regulate all of them. Several illegally developed schemes have huge populations that could not be relocated due to various legal, administrative and livelihood issues.
When asked why Ruda focused on according approvals instead of focusing on quickly completing river training works to mitigate floods, he said that the river training works had already been completed in a 7km area onward from Ravi Syphon. He claimed, “You can see that wherever we completed our works, the flood didn’t affect anyone”. The fees received from housing scheme developers were being spent on the ongoing development works in Ravi, he added.
To another question, he said enforcement teams had carried out several operations in the Ruda project area against illegal housing schemes. He claimed that when Ruda’s flood adaptation work was completed, the remaining area would be completely safe.
Meanwhile, Federal Minister for Communications Aleem Khan, who has been under fire after his housing scheme — the ParkView Housing society — was flooded from Ravi, released a
video
on social media on the issue. He said that he acquired the housing scheme through a bank auction in 2010 along with all the NOCs and approvals from relevant government bodies, including LDA as Ruda was established later.
He also criticised Ruda for not completing the barrages, embankments and other protective structures in the area. He said that it was Ruda’s responsibility to safeguard the area from floods. He said the authority charged housing societies for building protective structures.
He claimed that despite collecting all the charges, Ruda had not made a single road, embankment, lake or barrage in the area.According to former LDA chief engineer Dr Habib ul Haq Randhawa, who also specialises in environmental sciences, river routes whether old or new should not be blocked through urban development, commercial regeneration or for any purpose whatsoever. During normal flow, he said, a river could be temporarily diverted with the help of embankments.
“But extreme flooding will damage such structures, besides increasing the intensity of the flood. Therefore, we should refrain from all kind of developments in the river-influenced areas which are prone to flooding even only once a decade,” Dr Randhawa said while talking to
Dawn
.
“In the river routes adjacent to cities, a delicate relationship exists between humans and the ecosystem. Government agencies should only allow sustainable town planning having the least impact on the river ecosystem and its flow,” he said.
He suggested to conduct a comprehensive report delineating each riverbed and flood influence. He said intensive plantation should be done in the vacant riverbeds as it curbed flash flooding from the rivers. “The riverbeds must have margins wide enough to grow and shrink without endangering the population. Native vegetation and classic riparian forests should be grown there. These steps help to reduce the waterflow and flooding,” Mr Randhawa said.

He was speaking to participants of the 8th Pharma Summit, which was organised by Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA). The event brought together leading pharmaceutical exporters, industry leaders, policymakers and international experts.
Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani noted the early adoption of artificial intelligence, digital health platforms and advanced manufacturing technologies, along with supportive institutional efforts such as reducing duties on Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and the launch of PharmEx Pakistan.
“The way forward lies in a progressive approach that links innovation, collaboration, and sustainability,” he stressed, adding that with resilience and determination, Pakistan’s pharmaceutical industry could claim a much larger share of the trillion-dollar global pharmaceutical market.
Speaking at the ceremony, the Senate chairman termed it a matter of national pride, emphasising that Pakistan now meets the vast majority of its pharmaceutical needs through local production.
Speaking at the event, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal said the government had to take effective steps to increase exports.
“We have to achieve the set development targets in the next five years, and take effective steps to boost exports,” the minister said.
He added that the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) and the health ministry were fulfilling their responsibilities together.
Further, he stated Pakistan faced many serious health challenges, adding that the burden of patients on hospitals was excessive, which was increasing pressure on the system.
“In view of the increase in population, there is a dire need for small hospitals and dispensaries. We have to establish a health system that minimises the number of patients,” Mr Kamal said.
On the occasion, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan said pharmaceutical exporters were Pakistan’s ambassadors, promoting the country’s name worldwide.
Haroon Akhtar highlighted that industrial policy and regulatory reforms were the foundation of Pakistan’s economic future.
He emphasised that the pharmaceutical industry played a vital role in ensuring the health and well-being of Pakistan’s 250 million people.
Reaffirming the government’s support, Haroon Akhtar Khan said: “The government stands firmly with the pharmaceutical industry. Our policies are aimed at strengthening the sector while ensuring the availability of affordable and quality medicines for the people.”
At the Pharma Export Awards, the top 50 pharmaceutical exporters were honoured for their contributions.

He strongly criticised his political opponents while announcing a development expenditure of Rs28 billion by the KMC this year, accusing his critics of spreading negative propaganda instead of working for the city.
Speaking to the media in Korangi district, the mayor said: “Some people wake up at 11am just to hold press conferences and spread despair among the public, while we are working day and night for the city”.
“I will not let anyone engage in hypocritical politics. We are not sitting in Islamabad but are among the people of Karachi, serving them,” he added.
Mr Wahab, providing details, stated that Rs28bn has been allocated in this year’s budget for urban improvement, while the total volume of the city’s projects stands at Rs400bn.
Wahab criticises opponents for ‘spreading despair’ instead of serving citizens
He highlighted major ongoing works, including a Rs70bn investment in the
K-IV water project
and the construction of bridges at Murghi Khana, Shah Faisal Colony and Cattle Colony. He also confirmed that work on the ICI Bridge would commence shortly.
Accompanied by City Council Parliamentary Leader Karamullah Waqasi, the mayor defended the administration’s strategic decisions, such as the installation of costly paver blocks in areas prone to drainage issues. He described it as a “sustainable solution” and stressed that political will was more important than financial constraints.
“Money is not the issue; the real issue is intention. Words accomplish nothing; we must take practical steps,” he said.
Mr Wahab reiterated that the KMC is restoring 106 roads across the city following the recent rains, with work to be completed within 60 days. “When our people wake up in the morning, they will find newly built roads. Even at 2am our teams are working,” he said, adding that repair projects were active in all districts of Karachi.
Highlighting his personal commitment to the projects, he said: “Wherever work is being carried out late at night in the city, I will inspect it.”
Later, the mayor visited Empress Market in Saddar to personally inspect the reconstruction of Shahrah-i-Liaquat. He said that work had already begun at Empress Market, Preedy Street and Sharea Faisal, while KMC had also constructed roads at Malir Kala Board and Khokhrapar.
Appealing to the public for vigilance and participation, the mayor urged citizens to report any negligence they observed. “We request citizens to contact us wherever they see any shortcomings,” he said.
He also underscored his administration’s commitment to accountability, stating: “I am answerable to the people of Karachi, and there will be no compromise on transparency.”
Mr Wahab pointed out that KMC was also working beyond its jurisdiction. “The people of Karachi have the right to question us, and we are bound to answer them, because this is our city and we are its real custodians,” the mayor added.
Although the roads of Model Colony Town fall under the town administration, KMC was undertaking this work as well, he said. If a few billion rupees were allocated to Model Colony Town and utilised properly, he added, the area’s condition could improve significantly. Sewerage work would also begin soon, with the foundation to be laid next week.
The mayor also said that funds were being provided to institutions such as Indus Hospital, SIUT and NICVD so that citizens could have access to the best healthcare facilities.
Declaring that he was proud to be a Mohajir, Mr Wahab said the people of Karachi were his own. He appealed to all institutions and representatives to avoid negative politics and to work together for the development of the city.
On site, staff from the KMC Engineering Department gave the municipal chief a detailed briefing on the scope and progress of the ongoing restoration works across Karachi.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1938763/floodwater-inundates-relief-camps-in-kot-momin,Floodwater inundates relief camps in Kot Momin - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"SARGODHA: The relief camps set up by the administration in the
flood-affected
areas of Kot Momin tehil have also been filled with floodwater as the rescue and relief efforts entered the sixth day on Sunday.
As per details, thousands of people have been displaced by the floods along the River Chenab in Kot Momin tehil of Sargodha district. The administration claimed that more than 8,000 people had been rescued and shifted to safer areas.
However, majority of the residents of the affected area were still living in their submerged homes along with their cattle. These people are at risk of snake and insect bites, particularly while trying to cut fodder from the inundated fields.
According to the district administration, Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Waseem was present in the affected areas with his entire field formation. Assistant commissioners distributed breakfast to the flood-affected people in relief camps and homes. The administration said that food, clean drinking water, medicines and other necessary facilities had been ensured for the flood affectees.
The DC said that public health facilities were also being ensured in the affected areas under the leadership of Health Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr Sara Safdar. While, he said, agriculture director was ensuring uninterrupted supply of fodder for cattle. He said the Pakistan Army, Rescue 1122, police and other institutions engaged in the rescue and rehabilitation operation were the real heroes.
Dr Sara said that for the provision of free medical facilities, about 1,000 doctors and paramedical staff were working in three shifts at two field hospitals, 28 mobile clinics and nine campuses in the affected areas.
Majority of residents still living in their submerged homes along with cattle
The Livestock department had also deployed three veterinary camps, seven mobile dispensaries and 17 veterinary doctors in the affected areas. Six deputy directors and an additional director had been deployed in the field to monitor the situation. So far, the administration claimed that 12,475 animals had been vaccinated.
Meanwhile, a group of people, claiming to bring food for more than 1,000 people, had been stopped by the administration. When this correspondent contacted the administration, an official said the private citizens were stopped to ensure provision of safe and hygienic food for the flood affectees.
Meanwhile, Pakistan People’s Party Central Information Secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan  and PPP District Sargodha President Malik Hamid Nawaz Awan along with  their team visited the flood-affected areas of Kot Momin.
Speaking to the media on this occasion, Mr Chan alleged the administration comes to the embankment, takes pictures and then goes back. The residents of the  area are worried, their crops and houses have been destroyed and are  currently waiting for help from the government, but the administration  is limited to photo sessions only.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944436/nab-starts-online-transfer-of-recovered-money-into-victims-accounts,NAB starts online transfer of recovered money into victims’ accounts - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: Taking a step towards digitalisation and facilitate victims of fraud cases, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has devised a system for disbursing their recovered money from the fraudulent through online.
“Addressing difficulties faced by victims of various financial scams in receiving their amounts, NAB has decided to transfer recovered funds to victims online,” says an official press release issued by the NAB headquarters on Wednesday.
The new payment system was launched at a ceremony presided over by NAB chairman retired Lt-Gen Nazir Ahmed. In the first phase, recovered funds were directly transferred online to victims of the B4U fraud.
The NAB chief himself initiated the online transfer of funds directly into the bank accounts of victims.
In the past, NAB used to return money to a limited number of victims at a time via pay orders, a time-consuming process that required victims to physically visit NAB offices to receive their money. Now, NAB has completely digitised this process so that funds can be transferred directly to the victims’ bank accounts, eliminating the traditional, time-consuming method, the press release said.
At the ceremony, NAB Islamabad/Rawalpindi region transferred Rs878.709 million to accounts of 5,008 victims of the B4U fraud in a single day
NAB began its investigation into the B4U fraud in Feb 2021 based on complaints from the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the victims.
The investigation has now been completed after which the accused have admitted a liability of Rs7.3 billion, of which an initial amount of Rs3.7 billion has been recovered and it is being distributed among 17,250 victims. The remaining amount will be distributed among victims after its recovery.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939809/flood-accountability,Flood accountability - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"IN just a few weeks, Pakistan has been struck by its
worst flooding
since 2022, with Punjab facing
devastation
on a scale not seen in decades. In eastern and southern Punjab,
millions
have been displaced, villages submerged and relief systems overwhelmed. KP is grappling with flash floods and landslides that have claimed hundreds of lives, while Sindh, Balochistan and Azad Kashmir remain on
high alert
, vulnerable to rising waters and weak infrastructure.
With an escalating humanitarian crisis on our hands, the need for transparency in flood mitigation is urgent. While federal and provincial authorities clamour to reassure the public that rehabilitation efforts have started, on-the-ground realities are vastly different.
In Punjab, communities along the Sutlej, Chenab, and Ravi rivers recount harrowing tales: hundreds of villages inundated, families evicted from their homes without essentials, and relief camps devoid of clean water, medical aid and sanitary facilities. Women and children share two washrooms among thousands, meals arrive once and livestock go starving. Such reports are an indictment of a relief system undermined by inefficiency, complacency and a dearth of oversight.
Compounding the crisis is the controversy surrounding Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif. She posted a ‘portable toilet’ image as part of flood-relief operations, only for critics to unveil it as a recycled stock photo. She has also drawn flak for ration boxes stamped with her image and an ill-judged gaffe on rainfall. In short, Punjab’s
flood response
has been marred by missteps that risk eroding public trust at a critical time. Relief must be real, not staged.
However, the point is not to scapegoat one province, but to demand accountability everywhere. In Sindh, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has
called for
transparency, urging authorities to “leave no stone unturned” in relief efforts and long-term rehabilitation planning. Words, however, must translate swiftly into action.
Federal lawmakers must also be held to account for their role — not just in rhetoric, but in presence. Are they visiting their flood-ravaged constituencies? Is anyone monitoring the quality of aid? Are funds and supplies reaching the needy rather than being siphoned off by bureaucracy?
All political parties must recognise that disaster is not a moment for politicking, but a test of governance. Every province must issue transparent, auditable data on relief distribution, evacuation figures, camp facilities, and rehabilitation plans. Independent monitoring bodies — journalists, civil society, even volunteers — must be welcomed, not restricted. Floods respect no banners or borders. Our collective response must match the scale of the tragedy — not with posturing, but with precision. Only when transparency becomes the rule, not the exception, can the nation begin rebuilding — not just homes and fields, but trust.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940091/balochistan-takes-priority-over-flood-discussion-in-na,Balochistan takes priority over flood discussion in NA - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: The ‘worsening’ law and order situation in Balochistan overshadowed the ongoing debate on the flood situation in the National Assembly on Friday as the lawmakers belonging to the province protested over the alleged government’s failure to protect life and property of the citizens in the wake of recent spike in terrorism incidents.
The house also passed a resolution “condemning in the strongest words” the recent
suicide bombing
at the public meeting of the BNP-Mengal in Quetta and “demanding of the provincial government to bring the perpetrators to justice.”
The resolution, read out by Pullain Baloch of the National Party (NP), said that 15 people died and more than 75 people were injured in the incident.
The blast took place near Shahwani Stadium in Quetta’s Sariab area on Tuesday night, shortly after the conclusion of the public meeting of the BNP-M held to mark the death anniversary of late Sardar Attaullah Mengal.
Lawmakers slam govt’s handling of situation in the province; cite ongoing ‘military ops’, failure to address missing persons’ issue
BNP President and MNA Akhtar Mengal, who presided over the gathering, remained unhurt as the blast occurred when he was leaving for home. PkMAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Asghar Khan Achakzai of the ANP, and former senator Mir Kabeer Muhammad Shai of the National Party were also present, but escaped unhurt.
Speaking in the NA, Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri of the JUI-F said that since he was a child, he had been witnessing “military operations” in the province. He alleged that the government was not ready to pay heed to the genuine grievances of the people of Balochistan, and was unable to satisfy the family members of the missing persons.
“Instead of stopping the [military] operations, lawlessness and cruelty, the rulers are unfortunately sprinkling salt on the wounds of the people,” said Mr Haideri while referring to a reported statement of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi in which he had stated that the Balochistan issue could be handled even by a police official of the rank of station house officer (SHO).
The JUI-F leader cited a number of recent terror attacks in the province, including the one on his own convoy, claiming that over 1,000 people and security personnel had so far lost their lives in these incidents. He asked the government to convene an all parties’ conference on the Balochistan issue.
The JUI-F lawmaker regretted that some 40 relatives, mostly woman and children, had been staging a protest sit-in outside the press club in Islamabad, but the government had not sent any delegation or team to hear their grievances. Instead, he regretted, the authorities were bent upon declaring them “traitors”.
“How can you call these people traitors and rebels when they have been sitting in the capital right under the nose of the parliament and the judiciary” requesting the government to tell them the whereabouts of their missing family members.
Another JUI-F MNA Usman Badini in his speech hit out at the opposition PTI over the party’s alleged silence on the issues of Balochistan.
“On one hand, the PTI people are making Mehmood Khan Achakzai their head and on the other hand, they are not ready to talk about the suicide attack in Balochistan,” he said.
Responding to the speeches of Balochistan MNAs, State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry reaffirmed the government’s readiness to engage with Balochistan’s leadership and political representatives to find practical solutions to the province’s issues.
About the ongoing protest outside the NPC in Islamabad, the minister said the authorities had been providing security and necessary facilitation to them despite the fact that they had been staging protest on a road inside the Red Zone. He claimed that the government as well as the district administration officials had been in continuous contact with the protesters, and “trying to address their concerns through proper channels.”
He alleged that some individuals were exploiting the ongoing protest for their personal gains or political point-scoring.
The minister informed the house that nearly 2,000 missing person cases had been registered and the relevant commission had been monitoring these matters according to rules.
Interestingly, the minister indirectly put the blame of the Quetta blast on the organisers of the public meeting, stating that holding political gatherings without proper clearance created soft targets.
PTI’s walkout
At the outset of the sitting, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan regretted that the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was not helping the flood-affected people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Mr Khan announced that the PTI members had decided to boycott the NA sitting, stating they could not be a part of the “unco­nstitutional proceedings”.
The PTI members staged a walkout from the assembly after making a failed attempt to disrupt the proceedings by pointing out quorum.
Speaker Ayaz Sadiq declared the house in order following a headcount and continued proceedings without the PTI members.
The speaker castigated them for boycotting the NDMA briefing and offered them that he could arrange a separate briefing of the NDMA officials for the PTI members.
He said after staging a walkout from the house, the PTI members would now tell the press outside the Parliament House that they were not being given opportunity to speak. The PTI members held a “public assembly session” outside the Parliament House.
The NA session, which began on Monday, has been prorogued for an indefinite period.

Well-placed sources told
Dawn
that the present
flood situation
in the riverine areas was one of the key factors behind the dacoits’ willingness to surrender.
They said that the development was discussed during the inaugural meeting of the Katcha Areas Monitoring Committee (KAMC), which reviewed the ongoing anti-bandit operations, the security situation and the provincial government’s broader strategy.
The sources said that the Larkana police have informed their high-ups that more than 260 dacoits in the Katcha area have expressed their willingness to surrender in view of the impending flood threat.
Over 260 dacoits contacted Larkana police, sought reintegration support from govt, meeting told
Talking to
Dawn
, Home Minister Zia-ul-Hassan Lanjar, who chaired the KAMC meeting, said that the surrender process would be handled strictly according to the law. “The law is already there empowering the government to deal with those who are willing to surrender,” he added.
He also said that the Sindh government was “extremely” sincere and determined to eliminate the bandits in the Katcha area. “However, any bandit or group of bandits surrendering peacefully and presenting themselves before the law will strictly be subject to rules and regulations, as the law is clear on matters of surrender,” he added.
Plan underway to ensure dacoits’ surrender
Informed sources said that the authorities were working on a plan to provide an exit route for those willing to surrender, while hardened criminals involved in serious crimes like murder and kidnapping for ransom may face strict action.
They said that a plan was also under deliberation to encourage dacoits and their abettors in the riverine areas to surrender, provided they give up their sophisticated weapons unconditionally.
A report on this development has been submitted to the provincial government, which is currently examining the legal framework for handling hardened criminals in the Katcha area involved in serious offences like murder and kidnapping for ransom, said the sources.
They said that the provincial government was exploring possible legal provisions that could offer a way out for these outlaws if they choose to surrender.
They also said that some law enforcement agencies were considering offering a general amnesty to dacoits who agree to surrender. However, the provincial government was reportedly hesitant to extend leniency to hardened criminals involved in serious crimes like multiple murders and kidnapping for ransom.
Police seek equipment, weapons to combat bandits
During the KAMC meeting, Additional Inspector General of Police Zubair Nazir Sheikh provided a briefing on the law and order situation and ongoing operations in the Katcha areas. He emphasised the urgent requirement for modern equipment, advanced weapons, and secure vehicles to effectively combat the bandits.
Additionally, he highlighted the need to enhance facilities at existing checkpoints in the riverine areas and outlined plans to equip police with cutting-edge technology and professional training to boost their capabilities.
The home minister directed that detailed and practical recommendations for providing necessary resources to the police be submitted promptly.
He stated that after the construction of bridges at Dadu, Moro, Larkana and Khairpur, crimes had decreased, but it is vital to accelerate work on the Ghotki and Kashmore bridge projects so they are completed at the earliest. The construction of these bridges on this route will also significantly reduce crime.
Mr Lanjar also asked the schools & education and health departments about the number of schools, educational institutions, hospitals, and dispensaries in the Katcha areas.
He said the purpose of this inquiry was to establish temporary campuses during operations to ensure that the provision of education and health facilities does not get interrupted.
He acknowledged that delays in the past had prevented the operation from being completed but emphasised that the anti-bandit operation must be brought to a successful conclusion under all circumstances.
He appealed to all stakeholders to demonstrate collective determination and stand as strong partners.
The meeting was attended, among others, by the IGP Sindh, senior members Board of Revenue, education and law secretaries, representatives of the health and forest departments, Additional IG of CTD and Special Branch, and representatives of Sindh Rangers and other security agencies.

repatriation
.
The administration constituted committees comprising officials of the district administration and elders with some other stakeholders in Bara, Jamrud and Landi Kotal to convince Afghan refugees about dignified and honourable repatriation in line with the government’s policy instead of forced return.
It also compiled particulars of all Afghan families living in Khyber, mostly in Landi Kotal and Jamrud areas, to ensure easy access to them in the future.
Deputy commissioner Rao Bilal Shahid told
Dawn
that the provincial government had clearly informed all DCs that there won’t be forced repatriation of Afghans.
DC says 6,500-7,000 families returning daily
“We have been directed by the provincial government to determine and ascertain the current status of the Afghans living in our districts through local elders and those who have any trading relationship with them and convey to them the government desire of an honourable and dignified return,” he said.
The DC said that though no deadline was fixed for the return of Afghans whose Proof of Registration cards and Afghan Citizen Card had been “deregistered” but those living in Khyber tribal district were conveyed the message through the nominated committees to be prepared for their voluntary return.
He said 150 families, whose PoR cards were revoked since the expiry of the August 31 deadline, have voluntarily returned to Afghanistan, while the local communities were in constant contact with the remaining families by reminding them about the official repatriation procedure.
“At present, 6,500-7,000 families are going back to Afghanistan on a daily basis as the return process has gained momentum since the expiry of the August 31 deadline for all types of registered and illegal Afghans,” he said.
However, Afghan nationals residing in Landi Kotal denied they’re approached by anyone or got any verbal or written message about their repatriation.
Requesting anonymity, they said a majority of them had been living in Landi Kotal since late 60s, with many born in Pakistan.
An Afghan shopkeeper and a fabric trader told
Dawn
that he was born in 1974 in Landi Kotal but didn’t remember when his father or grandfather had migrated to Pakistan from Nangarhar province of Afghanistan.
“I have 42-year experience of trading in Landi Kotal and cultivated deep business and social relationships with locals,” he said.
He said never in the last five decades, he or other Afghans living here faced such an uncertain situation.
“I along with other Afghans living in Khyber are now contemplating winding up their businesses despite the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government’s repeated pledges that Afghans living in the province won’t be forced to go to their country of origin as they do not see any hope of the reversal of the recently announced repatriation policy,” he said.
Another Afghan national in the restaurant business said he and his family had no intention to go back to Afghanistan as they had been living in Pakistan since 1971, with most of them happily settled here since then. He added that all Afghan children were enrolled in local educational institutions.
“Neither my heart nor my soul allows me to desert Pakistan as we have invested all our capital here and our children do not even know which province or district of Afghanistan they belong to as they belong to the fourth generation of our family which has been residing here since decades,” he said.
Both these Afghan businessmen told
Dawn
that they had only thrice visited their native province of Nangarhar since their migration to Pakistan and they also had family members buried here.
Traders in Bara said around 3,000 Afghan shopkeepers were running their businesses in Bara, while 1,800 were registered with the Landi Kotal Bazaar Union.
They said that almost all Afghan traders and shopkeepers lived in the bordering localities of Peshawar as they’re expelled from Bara in 2009 when a military operation began against the outlawed terrorist groups.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1932302/when-women-need-permission-to-heal-everyone-pays,"When women need permission to heal, everyone pays - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","Maryam, a 28-year-old university lecturer and researcher, lives with endometriosis — a condition that causes debilitating pain. She has made multiple visits to the doctor, knows the procedure required to fix the pain and has the money for it as well. Yet, her days and nights are spent in agony because a private hospital in Lahore, located in her neighbourhood, refuses to treat her.
Why? Because she does not have a man’s consent — her ‘non-existent’ husband’s. Maryam is unmarried, and so, she continues to suffer.
Unfortunately, Maryam’s story is not unique.
Across Pakistan,
women are routinely told to get a man’s approval before receiving medical care, from reproductive health to diagnostic procedures and even emergency surgeries.
Such practices by healthcare providers don’t just reflect a larger societal thinking, but also disempower women, beginning with households and eventually seeping deeper into the system.
Gatekeeping healthcare
As per the
2024 UN National Development Report
, only 12 per cent of women in Pakistan can themselves decide about getting medical treatment in case of a health issue, while 17pc said the decision was taken by the head of the household. Another 28pc said that the matter was decided upon in consultation with other women of the family. On the other hand, a staggering 42pc of women said that everyone in the house, except for the patient in question, got to decide whether a medical treatment was necessary.
This gatekeeping is even more severe in rural areas, where access to basic healthcare is scarce.
But what seemingly looks like social or moral injustice — which it definitely is — is also an economic crisis in disguise. When women are denied bodily autonomy, it is not just a violation of their rights; it is also a denial of economic agency. And when half the population of the country is excluded from making decisions about their own health, the cost is borne by not just women, but by their households and by the country at large. This cost is counted not only in lives lost, but in lost productivity, higher poverty, and stalled national growth.
According to 2025
estimates
by the World Health Organisation, 27 mothers and 675 babies under a month old die every single day from preventable complications in Pakistan. That accounts for over 246,000 newborn deaths, nearly 10,000 maternal deaths, and 190,000 stillbirths annually. While maternal mortality has
fallen
, from 276 deaths per 10,000 live births in 2006 to 155 in 2024, we still rank among the worst in South Asia.
A system built to fail
The denial of healthcare autonomy is not simply a result of outdated thinking, but is in fact enabled by a structural failure in our healthcare system. There is no national law requiring spousal consent for adult women, yet the absence of a clear enforcement framework allows hospitals to impose their own arbitrary rules, thus infantilising women.
These arbitrary practices thrive within a broader system that is chronically underfunded and blind to gender-specific needs. Pakistan’s public health spending has
hovered around 1pc
of the gross domestic product (GDP) for the last five years.
Source: Finance Division, Government of Pakistan
This chronic underinvestment has left rural clinics understaffed and urban hospitals overcrowded and costly. Despite high maternal and neonatal mortality rates, there is limited state-level investment in gender-sensitive infrastructure, staff training, or outreach. Reproductive health services — particularly for conditions like endometriosis, PCOS, or miscarriage — are rarely available at the primary healthcare level, despite their prevalence.
Even when legal frameworks exist to support women, access is far from guaranteed. Pakistan’s penal code permits abortion to save a woman’s life, and in early stages for “necessary treatment”, yet stigma, moral policing, and provider bias routinely block care. Without enforcement and sensitivity training, legality remains meaningless for those who need it most.
When facilities are accessible, cultural norms pose another barrier. Women are more likely to seek medical care from female healthcare providers, yet only
46.9pc of registered doctors
are women. For patients, a shortage of female doctors deters care-seeking among female patients, particularly where
purdah
norms prevail.
Unsurprisingly, Pakistan ranks last on the global gender gap index calculated for 146 countries by the World Economic Forum in 2025, and ranked 131st in health and survival, though a slight improvement from its 132nd place in 2024. These are not just rankings — they are reflections of how we’ve built our systems and who we have left out.
The price of denied autonomy
When women are unable to access timely medical care, their participation in the economy suffers. Untreated health issues, particularly reproductive ones, can lead to chronic conditions, lost workdays, and long-term dependency.
According to
data
by the International Labour Organisation, Pakistan’s female labour force participation is among the lowest in South Asia — rising from 13.95pc in 1990 to just 21.67pc in 2019 — with the lack of reproductive health access being a key, though often overlooked, contributor. Women experiencing undiagnosed or untreated reproductive health issues may be forced to withdraw from both formal and informal employment.
Moreover, women also shoulder disproportionate out-of-pocket medical costs, and delayed treatment often leads to health complications, requiring costlier interventions or prolonged care. Women from underprivileged backgrounds, especially in rural areas, may resort to borrowing, asset sales, or foregoing treatment altogether — further perpetuating cycles of poverty.
On a macro level, a high fertility rate,
3.6 births per woman in 2024
, combined with weak maternal health indicators, means Pakistan risks missing its demographic dividend — the economic growth potential that arises when a country has a relatively large working-age population and fewer dependents.
If women, especially young and healthy ones, are unable to access timely healthcare or participate in the labour force due to poor reproductive health outcomes, this window of opportunity closes before Pakistan can reap its full benefits. Countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia have leveraged investments in women’s health and education to grow their economies. Pakistan, without similar investments, may fail to capitalise on its expanding working-age population.
What needs to change
For women in Pakistan, the right to decide about their own health is far from guaranteed. A national protocol affirming that every adult woman can give informed consent for her own medical care is long overdue — one that leaves no room for interpretation and penalises institutions that flout it.
But legal clarity alone won’t help if care remains out of reach. Reproductive health services for common, and often debilitating conditions like PCOS, miscarriage care, and endometriosis are concentrated in big city hospitals. At the primary healthcare level, these are either missing or handled without privacy, dignity, or trained staff. Raising public health spending above the current 1pc of the GDP and earmarking resources for women’s health could make these services accessible to millions.
At the same time, it is important to understand that the people providing healthcare matter just as much as the facilities. Training healthcare workers to provide respectful and non-judgmental care, especially for young, unmarried, or marginalised women, would restore trust in a system many avoid until it is too late.
Retaining female doctors is equally crucial. While they make up the majority of medical graduates, unsafe workplaces, rigid schedules and and the lack of support drive many out of the profession. Flexible hours, secure facilities, and re-entry programmes would keep them in service and improve access for female patients.
Perhaps, the hardest shift will be in social attitudes. Women should not have to justify a hospital visit, nor seek permission to protect their health. Public awareness campaigns, built on empathy, could help dismantle these norms and affirm that adult women are capable decision-makers.
Denying women the right to make decisions about their own bodies weakens households, burdens the healthcare system, and constrains national growth. This is not just a health crisis or a gender issue — it is a national development failure.
The question is no longer whether women should have autonomy. The question is: how much longer can Pakistan afford the cost of denying it?

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944069/isnt-hindutva-embarrassing-india,Isn’t Hindutva embarrassing India? - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"THE Beatles needed to breathe again after a traumatic experience with Imelda Marcos. They found solace in India even if they were not eventually convinced of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s healing powers.
Nelson Mandela needed to thank those who with their moral courage stood by him through the thick and thin of apartheid. He visited India at the top of the list just to express his deep gratitude. India was regarded as a spiritual Alamut and a politically upright comrade, not calculating or self-regarding, but an earnest friend.
It has taken 11 years to sully the image. Hindu Nepal or Muslim Saudi Arabia, Christian US or Buddhist Sri Lanka and, closer to home, the marooned Sikhs in Punjab — the message from everyone is unmistakable and loud. Hindu nationalism has humiliated India and has put it on a slippery slope to a catastrophe.
All the tight and usually unwarranted embraces the Indian prime minister unleashed on foreign dignitaries over a decade or so and got photographed for a captive media to sing paeans to, ring hollow today.
Indians abroad are increasingly enduring the slings and arrows of racism, jingoism and slur, all because they know that returning home holds even more dire prospects for them. How many Indian prime ministers before the advent of Narendra Modi needed to lunge at heads of state or government to hug them at any opportunity? Or which of them would even remotely consider committing electoral
support
to a foreign leader as Modi did, least of all to “my friend Donald Trump”?
Indira Gandhi comes to mind for famously ducking a fraternal bear hug from Fidel Castro when he handed her the gavel at the 1983 Non-Aligned Summit in New Delhi. And yes, she did make personal intervention with a foreign government, albeit when she was not in office. That’s when she pleaded with Gen Zia to spare Z.A. Bhutto’s life. She held Nusrat Bhutto’s hand from her rented home in Delhi throughout the traumatic denouement.
As for Modi’s halcyon days with Saudi Arabia before the rippling events of last week, he has much to thank Manmohan Singh for setting it right. During the Cold War, India had scant interest in the Saudi monarchy. In fact, Giora Becher, the Israeli envoy to India in 1992, shared a handy insight. “At any time the United States sold arms to Saudi Arabia, Indian and Israeli ambassadors made a beeline to the State Department to protest. They might have saved money by sharing a taxi, it was so regular.”
It can’t be blamed on terrorism that Modi’s India struggles to find stable relations with other neighbours too — of varied religious hues.
Singh broke the taboo by inviting the Saudi king as chief guest for the 2006 Republic Day parade. It had the high symbolism of A.B. Vajpayee visiting Lahore’s Minar-i-Pakistan in 1999. Why then the brouhaha when Saudi Arabia
signed
a defence pact with Pakistan?
Riyadh has always had special and equal ties with Islamabad. When the Saudis asked Pakistan to join the war against the Houthis in 2015, Pakistan’s parliament turned down the proposal. But after what Israel did with Qatar, it was a different story. Nobody in the South Asian neighbourhood is as worried as India is. It needn’t have been this way.
The thought is conditional. Had there been routine good neighbourly ties with Pakistan, the Saudi pact wouldn’t have amounted to anything more than its purpose — to vacate any threat to the Gulf state from Israel. Terrorism is cited as a factor for bad ties with Pakistan, which doesn’t wash. It can’t be blamed on terrorism that Modi’s India struggles to find stable relations with other neighbours too — of varied religious hues.
According to Manmohan Singh, both neighbours were close to clinching a win-win closure on Jammu and Kashmir. It was stalled when Musharraf was removed from power.
Which is to say that peace was possible despite the Mumbai carnage of 2008. The idea was to remove terrorism from its roots, and the reflection was discussed in Sharm El-Sheikh. Moreover, Xi Jinping told Modi precisely that during their meeting at a retreat in Tamil Nadu. For India to be truly prosperous, it would require normal ties with China and Pakistan, Xi said. Instead, Modi poked Xi in the eye with what China calls a cartographic
aggression
over Ladakh in August 2019.
The Galwan episode put paid to any further hopes. The good news is that the recent SCO summit in its
statement
condemned the horrific killings in Pahalgam, and slammed terror attacks in Pakistan, namely the Jaffar Express slaughter. Ergo: the world is ready to be guarantors against the scourge. It was this confidence that spurred Singh to be positive, which Modi will find difficult to be. He must play to the Hindutva script targeting Muslims and Christians much of the time, Pakistan all the time. The fallout is that India’s image stands dented enormously by its shocking isolation in Operation Sindoor.
In the Middle East, Hindu nationalism has played both sides of the street, embracing a genocidal Benjamin Netanyahu while hugging the sheikhs simultaneously. After the
Qatar incident
, this luxury may not exist.
Other questions remain though: Netanyahu had a reason to attack Qatar because it was host to the Hamas leadership; Saudi Arabia is inherently anti-Hamas. It’s, therefore, excessive to fear an imminent Israeli attack. But why should India worry about the defence pact? Discussion in the Indian media suggests the ‘suspended’ Operation Sindoor could be adversely impacted. How will Hindu nationalism negotiate that?
Yes, Donald Trump called to greet Modi on his birthday last week. Then he proceeded to give what some cartoonists vicariously described as birthday bumps. Trump
slapped
prohibitive costs on visas for Indian IT professionals to work in the US with the option of staying on. An all-round humiliation from the one who believes Modi is the father of the Indian nation.
“Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,” The Beatles song from 1965 tugs the heart ever more.

MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, accompanied by Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, visited Shaheed Benazirabad district on Wednesday to review preparedness and response measures in areas at risk of flooding.
During her visit, she was briefed by the commissioner, deputy commissioner and senior police, irrigation, rescue and health officials She was informed that under a super flood scenario up to 80,000 residents across 95 villages in nine union councils (UCs) could be affected.
Daily monitoring is being carried out with regular updates to assess and respond to the evolving situation. Officials also reported that approximately 64,000 livestock may be at risk, with evacuation efforts currently in progress.
Areas in Qazi Ahmed and Sakrand, including Saeed Kando, Phullel, Khad, Gehram Mari, Bahawal Shah, Mehrabpur, Mari and Morya Lakho have been identified as particularly vulnerable.
To support relief efforts, 59 relief camps have been identified and 11 medical camps have been activated so far. Arrangements for life jackets, boats, fire brigades, ambulances, dewatering pumps, and ventilators have also been made.
Commending the ongoing efforts, the first lady appreciated the authorities for their commitment to safeguarding lives and livelihoods.
Assuring the people of Shaheed Benazirabad that they would not be left alone in this hour of crisis, Ms Bhutto Zardari emphasised:
“This is not a moment for political division but rather a time to stand together as one nation.”
She directed all stakeholders to intensify relief work and continue working collectively to support flood-affected families, ensuring that every possible step is taken to protect lives and provide timely assistance.

4 million
people in Punjab, heavy monsoon
rains and floods
may lead to water, food and vector-borne diseases as the reports of overwhelming burden of the patients in most hospitals have started surfacing.
There are reports that diarrheal outbreaks during the floods may leave dire consequences followed by the dengue.
As per the figures so far, 158,000 flood affected people are suffering from various diseases, including diarrhea and skin, eye, chest-related ailments.
Quoting the official figures, a senior health official said 49,500 cases of chest infection, 43 of temperature with flu and 20,945 cases of diarrhea have been reported, mostly in the worst-hit districts of Punjab so far.
158,000 flood-hit people suffering from diarrhea, skin, eye, chest-related issues
Similarly, 143 cases of dogbites and 88 of snakebite have also been reported in the public hospitals.
The official claims that the Punjab government has initiated many measures to fight the expected outbreak of the diseases but the steps look insufficient.
“The Punjab health department delayed the process of the procurement of the medicines and other items, ignoring the challenging situations.For the procurement, it has sought applications from the interested firms on Sept 22 for the purchase of 50,000 nets, 1,150 mosquito spray machines and three million water purifying tablets.The delivery/supply and distribution of the above-mentioned items being purchased by the provincial health authorities may take further two months.”
The official says a comprehensive approach was required to prioritise the prevention, early detection, and prompt therapy to lower the morbidity/mortality rates for flood-hit areas affected by floods.
Talking to
Dawn
, Dr Masood Sheikh, a senior public health expert, says Pakistan is currently one of the most frequently flood-affected nations in the world, devastated by flooding and torrential rains. He says that the increasing frequency of flood disasters has significantly impacted community health and wellbeing in Punjab.
“Its consequences can be felt immediately, in the form of fatalities caused by injuries, or later, due to the localised spread of infectious diseases.”
Mr Sheikh says that the flood followed by massive monsoon spells has started taking heavy toll on Punjab.
Though, the health authorities were finding it too hard to collect true impact of diseases due to the prevailing challenging situations, the number of the affected people may reach beyond the expectations, he warns.
He expresses fears that Punjab may witness the rapid spread of the other diseases, including polio, measles, leishmaniasis, HIV, and Covid-19, which are easily preventable by vaccination.
“These figures will undoubtedly rise further due to the disruption in vaccination campaigns,” Mr Sheikh says, adding that the epidemics and outbreaks are most common affecting a larger population.
People may face various problems amidst floods like infectious diseases, reproductive health, and even mental health issues.
Dr Masood Sheikh says that a large number of flood victims are currently afflicted with skin and waterborne infections, including but not limited to diarrhea, a typical outbreak in floods.“The reasons for these common skin infections in such areas are the humidity and prolonged contact with contaminated water.”
He explains that the flooded areas act as the major source of mosquito breeding, as well as the lack of protection against mosquitoes and other insects leads to mosquito-related illness.
“As per the reports emerging from various parts of Punjab, there is an alarming rise of gastroenteritis cases in addition to cholera in certain flood affected areas. The battle against other illnesses such as dengue fever, polio and Covid-19 is also getting worse, especially in camps and places where there is a lack of clean water supply and sanitation while infrastructure is destroyed.”
He adds that following the flooding, there is a significant increase in the number of trauma cases in most parts of Punjab.
According to Dr Sheikh, women and children may be the most vulnerable victims of the floods while the pregnant women flood victims are significantly under threat of hepatitis (A and E) and nutritional deficiencies.Menstruating and pregnant women are in a dire situation since they have no access to menstruation supplies or a hygienic washroom.
“The pregnant women in flood-affected areas are likely to give birth within the next month need maternal health services.In addition to those giving birth to babies, the Punjab health authorities are struggling hard to ensure the access of such women to clinics and hospitals due to the massive damage done to the roadways and communication systems.”
Dr Masood Sheikh says that mitigating the spread of diarrheal diseases after floods requires a multi-pronged approach, including promoting hand hygiene by providing access to soap and water or hand-sanitizer, can make it easier for people to practise good hand-hygiene.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939507/parliament-to-take-up-bill-to-give-legal-cover-to-employees-regularised-during-ppp-govt,Parliament to take up bill to give legal cover to employees regularised during PPP govt - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: While the parliament may consider a bill in coming weeks to give
legal cover
to employees regularised by a cabinet subcommittee headed by Syed Khursheed Shah some two decades ago, a brief shows that around 20pc of 5,000 employees
regularised
in Basic Pay Scale (BPS) 16 and above have already retired.
Moreover, there will be no additional financial impact as all the employees have already been drawing salaries they were entitled to.
As mover, Syed Khursheed Shah is unwell and unable to personally present the bill in parliament, employees have tied their hopes on Raja Pervaiz Ashraf who may table the bill on Khursheed Shah’s behalf.
During the PPP government in 2008-13, the cabinet subcommittee headed by Syed Khursheed Shah was established for the regularisation of daily wage and contract employees. Tens of thousands of employees were regularised in dozens of ministries and divisions.
However, the Supreme Court, last year ordered the authorities to restart the process under Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) as the employees were regularised without tests and interviews. Majority of employees, regularised by the cabinet subcommittee, were non-gazetted, so they did not need to be referred to the FPSC.
Brief shows move will not have any additional financial impact on national kitty
According to the data collected by
Dawn
, around 5,000 employees of BPS-16 and above were regularised.
According to the brief, the bill titled: “The Protection of Rights of Regularised Civil Servants and Employees Bill, 2024” has been introduced by Syed Khursheed Shah. It claimed that employees were regularised by the subcommittee of the Cabinet and notified by the Establishment Division.
It claims that the matter involves no additional financial burden on the exchequer as all employees were regularised against sanctioned posts with allocated budgets and have been serving in the positions they were regularised since then.
“The current directive for these officers to qualify through the FPSC examination for ‘re-regularisation’ presents an insurmountable challenge. Having devoted 15 to 25 years of continuous and dedicated service, many are at an advanced stage of their careers. Notably, nearly 20pc have already retired and are drawing pensions, while over 30pc are above the age of 55. For them, the test and interview requirement is not only impractical but a source of profound anxiety and mental trauma,” the brief states.
A doctor of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Dr Saifur Rehman, said during the PPP government (2008–2013), the then prime minister, Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, constituted a subcommittee, which regularised thousands of employees, and the Ministry of Finance allocated the required budget sanctioned for each post during 2011 to 2025.
“However, after 16 years, the government is now seeking to send these employees home, directing that all officers from BPS-16 and above must once again qualify through the FPSC examination for their regularisation. At this stage of life, after having served most of their careers it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for them to undergo this process again,” he said.
“To address this serious issue, Syed Khursheed Shah has submitted a Private Member’s Bill to give legal cover to employees regularised between 2008 and 2012, just as all provincial assemblies have already secured similar protections for their employees. The Cabinet Committee has also recommended that the bill may be laid before the National Assembly. However, the federal government appears reluctant to pass it, which could render thousands of senior officers — who have served diligently for decades — jobless,” Dr Saif claimed.
“Thousands of affected employees, including senior doctors, professors, teachers and staff serving in federal ministries, are under immense stress and depression,” Dr Saif revealed.
Prominent orthopaedic surgeon at Pims Dr Asfandyar Khan, while talking to Dawn, urged the parliamentarians to play their role so that the bill regarding protection of employees sails through the parliament.
In September 2024, some employees approached the Supreme Court for seniority and other benefits, but the apex court ordered them to be sent to the FPSC.
On March 9, 2025, the Establishment Division issued an order under which all ministries and divisions started working to send regularised employees to FPSC. Now the passage of the bill through parliament can remove the looming sword on permanent basis.

The prime minister made the remarks during a meeting with Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, on the sidelines of the 80th Session of the
United Nations General Assembly
in New York.
According to a Topline Securities’
report
, Pakistan is on track to meet all seven Quantitative Performance Criteria (QPC) set by the IMF ahead of the September 25 review of its $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF),  which was
approved
in May this year. The review will assess Pakistan’s performance for the March–June quarter of 2025.
However, massive
floods
in the country have struck both the rural heartland and industrial centres for the first time in decades, causing billions of dollars in damage while straining food supplies, exports and a fragile economic recovery.
A statement issued by the Press Information Department (PID) following today’s meeting between PM Shehbaz and Georgieva said: “While emphasising that Pakistan was making steady progress towards meeting the various targets and commitments under the IMF programme, the prime minister said that the impact of the recent floods on Pakistan’s economy must be factored into the IMF’s review.”
The government had been optimistic about 2026, pencilling in 4.2 per cent growth on the back of a rebound in farming and manufacturing after the economy was stabilised under the IMF bailout. Instead, record monsoon rains since late June, amplified by dam releases from India, have submerged large swathes of Punjab and Sindh.
While waters have yet to recede in many districts, officials and analysts warn the hit could be deeper than in
2022
, when a third of the country lay under water, due to dual shocks to agriculture and manufacturing.
A report from the agricultural monitoring initiative GEOGLAM estimates at least 220,000 hectares of rice fields flooded between August 1 and September 16. In Punjab, 1.8 million acres of farmland have been inundated, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority.
According to the PID statement, Georgieva expressed her sympathy to all people affected by the floods.
“She noted the importance of the damage assessment to underpin recovery priorities,” the statement said, adding that the official commended PM Shehbaz’s commitment to pursuing sound macro-economic policies and reiterated the IMF’s continued support as Pakistan advances the necessary economic reforms to ensure sustainable long-term economic growth.
During the meeting, the premier also appreciated the IMF’s longstanding constructive partnership with Pakistan.
He acknowledged the IMF’s timely support under various instruments, including the Stand By Arrangement for $3bn in FY 2024, followed by the EFF of $7bn and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) of $1.4bn, per the statement.
“Today, with the institution of deep-rooted structural reforms, Pakistan’s economy [is] showing positive signs of stabilisation and is now moving towards recovery,” the premier was quoted as saying.
Premier meets World Bank president
Separately, PM Shehbaz also met World Bank (WB) Group President Ajay Banga and praised the bank’s support to the country, according to a separate press release issued by the PID.

While appreciating Banga’s leadership, the premier briefed him of the government’s “comprehensive reform agenda, encompassing resource mobilisation, energy sector reforms, privatisation and measures to build resilience against climate change”.
“He reiterated that the reform agenda had steered Pakistan towards macroeconomic stabilisation, restored investor confidence and promoted sustainable and inclusive economic growth,” the statement added.
PM Shehbaz also appreciated the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF), providing $40bn for Pakistan, reaffirming commitment to ensure its effective implementation in close coordination with provincial governments, it added.
The WB president appreciated Pakistan’s reform measures and reaffirmed commitment to the country’s development agenda. “He emphasised the bank’s readiness to extend continued support for advancing economic reforms and undertaking long-term initiatives on climate resilience under the new CPF,” the press release added.
It further stated, “Both sides reiterated their resolve to further strengthen cooperation under the CPF in order to advance Pakistan’s development priorities.”

There has been a recent
uptick
in terror attacks in Pakistan over the past year. The CTD regularly carries out operations to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence.
During the three months, 14 terrorists were arrested in Lahore, 14 in Rawalpindi, seven each in Faisalabad and Bahawalpur, six each in Jhang and Sargodha, five in Sahiwal, four from Gujranwala and three each from Bahawalnagar and Gujrat, the statement read.
“Of the arrested terrorists, 55 belong to
Fitna al Khawarij
, five are from ISIS (Islamic State), and two each are from Al-Qaeda, Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Jeay Sindh,” the statement added.
The state uses the term
Fitna al Khawarij
to refer to terrorists of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to the CTD, items seized during the raids include 20.2 kilogrammes of explosive material, 85 detonators, 183 feet of safety fuse wire, 717 pamphlets belonging to a banned organisation, magazines, detonating cord, mobile phones and cash.
The CTD added that 87 criminal cases have been registered against the arrested suspects, and investigations are underway.

The two parties, who are coalition partners in the Centre, have recently been arguing over the means for flood relief, with the PPP insisting on the use of BISP and the PML-N disapproving of the proposition. On Wednesday, after the PML-N questioned the transparency of  BISP, the PPP accused its senior partner of showing an “irresponsible attitude” by refusing to use the programme’s data to compensate flood-affected people in Punjab.
BISP is a national safety net programme in Pakistan that provides cash assistance to poor and vulnerable families, particularly targeting women.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi today, Bilawal said: “Across the country, the agriculture sector was already struggling, but after the floods, it has been badly affected. Our national food security may also be at risk.
“I had appealed to the federal government to declare a climate emergency and an agriculture emergency to address the losses caused by the floods,” he said. He added that he had also called for the power bills of farmers in affected districts to be waived.
He appreciated the federal government and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for following through on his requests.
Talking about the Sindh government, he said that he had spoken to the Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah about ways to support small farmers and landowners.
He said that through the Benazir Hari Card, the provincial government would support small farmers who owned between one and 25 acres of land. He added that the Sindh government would also support farmers with fertiliser.
“Our effort is to support the wheat crop so that we do not need to import wheat,” he said.
“If provincial and federal governments take timely action, we can not only mitigate the losses from this flood but also avoid a heavy import bill. It is better to spend our resources on our own farmers and the agriculture sector so that Pakistan’s economy can reach a position where we export instead of importing.”
Bilawal highlighted that the effects of the floods were ongoing. He said that while it had impacted the low-lying areas of Sindh, “the scale of loss in Punjab, especially south Punjab, is historic“.
“While it is very important to consider what you will do going forward, the most important thing is what you are doing today,” he said. Therefore, the support provided by the provincial government will be amplified if the BISP is used to reach those areas that are still underwater.
“A natural calamity is not the responsibility of any one province; across the world, the federal government plays the leading role. It is also the responsibility of the federal government to deliver relief to the affected people through BISP,” he said.
He said that while the most damage had been sustained by Punjab, it should not be forgotten that Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had also suffered.
“So, BISP is the sole method through which the federal government can provide immediate relief to the affected people. This has been the standard practice,” he said, adding that the Centre had done the same in the past and during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“If we don’t do this today, I must ask: what is the fault of the people of South Punjab when they face such devastating floods, their homes are destroyed, and they are living on the road?” he said, calling on the federal government to “review its policy”.
He further said the federal government should have sought international help from the outset.
“When the floods began, the federal government should not have waited for any provincial help. It should have issued an international appeal immediately. I am not criticising […] but if you are spending Rs100, you could have spent Rs200; if you were helping 100 people, you could have helped 200,” he said.
“By talking to the international community, by seeking a review of International Monetary Fund (IMF) restrictions, your hand would have been stronger if you had made a timely global appeal as you did previously. This time it should have happened, and it did not,” he said.
‘PPP politicising floods’
’Later in the day, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif accused the PPP of “politicising” the floods.
“The PPP is our ally and I respect them, but unfortunately, they have been politicising the floods in Punjab,” the CM said, addressing a ceremony in Dera Ghazi Khan.
“I don’t know their agenda, but I want to tell [President] Asif Zardari and [PPP Chairman] Bilawal … please help your party’s spokesperson understand that if, Gob forbid, there is a disaster in Sindh, Punjab would stand with it.”
The chief minister then turned her attention to BISP.
“Nowadays, people are talking about distributing aid through BISP. I do not want to criticise them … but they only give Rs10,000 [under this programme]. On the other hand, I will give them (flood victims) Rs1 million.”
Maryam termed flood relief through BISP a “very simplistic solution” and went on to say, “What will people who have lost their homes, cattle, and crops do with just Rs10,000?”
She said she wanted to rebuild the damaged houses and compensate for destroyed crops, but BISP “does not provide enough money”.
Reacting to criticism of not seeking international assistance for flood relief, she said, “The thing is, I am Nawaz Sharif’s daughter, and I will not beg for aid.”
“How long will Pakistan continue to beg the international community for aid? The NFC (National Finance Commission) gives billions to the provinces. What is this money being used for?” she said.",2025-09-25,Dawn.com,1464,0.00017
https://www.dawn.com/news/1944920/fresh-police-officers-replace-old-cohort-in-balochistan,Fresh police officers replace old cohort in Balochistan - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: The Establishment Division has dispatched a fresh batch of Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) officers to Balochistan, for-mally replacing a team deployed last year as part of a high-level security initiative triggered by a terrorist attack.
The move is a direct implementation of a rotational policy established by the federal government to maintain a sustained, enhanced administrative presence in the province.
The new group, consisting of seven officers from the 48th Common Training Program (CTP), is scheduled to assume their duties in the pro-vince from Oct 8 for a one-year term.
This administrative rotation stems from a decision made during a meeting of the National Apex Committee on Aug 29, 2024, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Deployment is part of federal rotational policy, initiated after Jaffer Express attack
The meeting followed the prime minister’s visit to Balochistan with Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir after an
August 2024 attack
on the Jaffer Express.
During that meeting, the prime minister issued a directive stating, “PAS and PSP officers of 47th CTP and above shall be posted in Balochistan in a phased manner.”
The Secretary of the Establishment Division was given a one-month deadline to execute the order.
In compliance, the government issued a notification on Sept 12, 2024, transferring 13 BS-17 officers of the 47th CTP to the Government of Balochistan.
Their mandate was for an “active period of 365 days,” excluding leave or training, to strengthen the provincial law enforcement and governance apparatus.
The necessity of the measure was underscored when the Jaffer Express was targeted again in March of this year, reaffirming security challenges in the region.
The initial one-year tenure for the first batch of officers concluded this month.
On Sept 25, 2025, the Establishment Division issued two notifications. The first officially relieved the 13 officers of the 47th CTP from their duties in Balochistan, instructing them to return to their original provincial allocations.
The second announced the posting of the seven new officers from the 48th CTP, ensuring a seamless transition.
In a parallel move, the federal government also extended the tenure of 35 PSP officers from the 49th CTP serving with the Federal Constabulary (FC) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for another year.
The FC is a key federal paramilitary force engaged in counter-insurgency operations in the province.
According to official notifications, the officers will serve for 365 days of active service.
The provincial government can request an extension for any officer, subject to the individual’s consent and approval from the Establishment Division.
It is also required to submit monthly reports on the utilisation of these officers’ services.

His came after the two leaders had their
first formal bilateral interaction
at the Oval Office in Washington on Thursday. During the meeting, they discussed regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism, among other matters.
The premier was accompanied by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, while the US President was joined by US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
The meeting itself was closed to the press — a break from President Trump’s usual modus operandi — as he is quite fond of Oval Office photo-ops and there was no press conference either; just a statement issued from Pakistan where the US president was described as a “man of peace” and stressing the need to enhance cooperation in security and intelligence.
During an interaction with the media in New Jersey, which was aired on
Geo News
on Saturday morning, the premier said the US was ready to share “techniques” with Pakistan in the areas of artificial intelligence, information technology and agriculture. The PM added that the US was also open to investment opportunities in the country.
“We have signed an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with one of their delegations,” he said, without sharing any further details.
PM Shehbaz said Pakistan’s economy has “stabilised at the macro level” and also credited overseas Pakistanis for their contributions and efforts. “No amount of gratitude is enough,” he said.
The premier also hailed Field Marshal Asim Munir for leading the nation “from the front” during a four-day
military encounter
between Pakistan in India in May.
“He led Pakistan with courage, boldness, and intelligence,” the PM said.

Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told
Dawn
that the fire erupted in a car showroom situated on the ground floor of the residential-cum-commercial building in Phase-II and spread rapidly to other floors.
He said six fire tenders rushed to the scene and managed to control the blaze. However, cooling work continued till late in the night.
The official said that with the help of a ladder, firemen broke windows and rescued eight residents, including women, and three workers of the showroom and shifted them to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) and the burns centre of the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.

The firm last week
decided to terminate
its offer to acquire up to 66.4 per cent of K-Electric Ltd due to changes in Pakistan’s business environment. It added that since the planning of the “major asset purchase”, the company had strictly adhered to relevant laws, regulations, and normative documents, actively promoting the various tasks involved in this major asset purchase.
“Given that the counterparty has consistently failed to meet the conditions precedent for closing and the changes in the business environment in Pakistan have rendered this transaction no longer aligned with the company’s international development direction, after careful study and analysis, in order to effectively safeguard the interests of the company and all its shareholders, the company has decided to terminate this major asset purchase,“ it had said.
KE is the only electricity generator, transmitter, and distributor for Karachi and its adjoining areas, and the only listed electricity supplier. It was privatised in 2005. Shanghai Electric Power had agreed to buy a controlling shareholding in KE from Abraaj Group back in 2016 for a sum of $1.77 billion. The transaction never materialised because the seller failed to obtain the required approvals from different authorities and liquidity constraints as a consequence of mounting circular debt in the country’s power sector.
President Zardari met Shanghai Electric Chairman Wu Lei today and later visited the company’s facilities in Shanghai while on a
10-day trip to China
.
“He invited Shanghai Electric to explore further investment in the modernisation of Pakistan’s transmission and distribution network. President Zardari assured Shanghai Electric that any outstanding issues would be resolved amicably and in a spirit of mutual cooperation,” said a statement from the PPP.
The president also thanked the chairman for the company’s contribution to meeting Pakistan’s energy needs, generating employment and supporting socio-economic development.
President Zardari further reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to enhancing security measures to ensure a safe and conducive environment for Chinese workers in the country, with CEO Lin Jigen expressing gratitude to the government for the security arrangements provided to its employees working in Pakistan.
The company chairman gave a briefing on its projects in Pakistan, including its work in Thar coal, nuclear energy, and coal-fired power plants.
President Zardari underlined the importance that Pakistan attached to the development of the Thar coal project, including the potential of coal-gasification, and witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the establishment of a coal gasification plant in Thar.
The MoU was signed between MFTC Coal Gasification & Manufacturing (Pvt) Ltd and Sino Sindh Resources (Private) Ltd/Shanghai Electric.
The statement said this was the first coal gasification and fertiliser project based on Thar coal, which would not only contribute to meeting the country’s energy needs but also play a vital role in supporting the agriculture sector.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941634,Confronting the 26th Amendment - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"IF there were ever a burning question, it would be regarding the
pending
26th Ame­ndment cases. In fact, there might be more. One of the questions, I suspect, may revolve around why such critical cases are being treated so uncritically.
Another would pertain to the reasons that compelled the Supreme Court to prioritise infructuous matters, or matters of dissimilar import, over those which hit the court’s credibility and integrity. Another may orbit around how the judiciary can even talk about judicial reform when it cannot decide the limits of its own judicial form.
Finally, one may ponder over what justice the Supreme Court can hope to deliver to others, when it evidently is unable to deliver justice to itself. All or any of these questions may be considered critical, and it can be debated which one deserves to be answered first. But what is beyond question is the silence of the court when it comes to answering any of them.
Whichever way one looks at it, the problem in the curious case of the challenges to the
26th Amendment
lies in its very fundamentals. In essence, the changes brought about by the amendment appear to touch upon the very scheme of the Constitution it seeks to amend. The Supreme Court has itself referred to this ‘scheme’ in different ways on different occasions — as a ‘basic structure’, or as ‘salient features’, or ‘prominent characteristics’.
Whichever permutation you prefer, the gist of the argument remains the same: the Constitution retains certain fundamental features that make it what it is, and without them, it would perhaps no longer be the Constitution of Pakistan. In layman’s terms, the salient features are the Constitution, or at the very least, it’s soul.
While there may be many salient features, democracy, a parliamentary form of government, and independence of the judiciary are three definite ones. A long history of cases previously has acknowledged the presence of such features in one form or the other. However, on whether a constitutional amendment itself can be struck down on the touchstone of the same, the case law has been less enthusiastic.
Interestingly, Pakistan’s courts have traditionally been seen as more resistant to striking down a constitutional amendment on the basis of the doctrine of salient features, as opposed to Indian jurisdiction’s accommodating and more welcoming position on the issue.
This, however, seems to have
changed in 2015
, when the Supreme Court, hearing matters relating to the vires of the
18th Amendment
, along with the
19th
and
21st Amendments
, specifically addressed this question. Out of a total of 17 judges, 11 not only upheld the presence of salient features in the Constitution in one form or the other, but also acknowledged and upheld the judicial review of a constitutional amendment on the basis of an infringement of the same. This is not to say that the judiciary retained unlimited powers to undo such amendments, which would be an overstatement.
Judicial independence is called a ‘principle’ of law for a reason.
However, in the context of the changes in the judicial appointment mechanism, as made by the 18th and 19th Amendments, and which revolved around the composition and functions of the judicial commission and parliamentary committee, the Supreme Court provided certain insightful observations.
In the context of Article 175-A of the Constitution, the court held that the litmus test for judicial independence appears to be that the power to initiate, as well as the primacy and decisiveness of the final outcome of the appointment process, must vest in the chief justices and members of the judiciary. Essentially, the judiciary must be given a decisive role in making such appointments and initiating them.
Earlier, in relation to the challenges to the 18th Amendment, and prior to the enactment of the 19th Amendment, the Supreme Court had articulated how the Constitution envisions a judiciary which is free from
executive influence
or oversight, and free from the shackles of legislative blackmail. It delineated such a principle on the basis of the constitutional provisions relating to a fair trial, separation of the executive from the judiciary, and securing an independent judiciary. It was actually in light of these principles that the need for the 19th Amendment was felt, which had whittled down the 18th Amendment in order to ensure that the executive and legislature would lack undue influence in judicial processes overall.
In my opinion, such influence would not merely be limited to considering the ratio of judicial officers to non-judicial representatives in the judicial commission, but would also have to consider the number of members, judicial or otherwise, being directly or indirectly appointed by the executive or legislature.
When the current challenges to the 26th Amendment are seen from this prism, the amendment does not seem to fulfil the above-mentioned litmus test or preserve the Constitution’s salient features. And that is perhaps why no one wants to deal with these cases. They have the potential to be messy, comes at an undesirable time, and is — for a lack of a better word — inconvenient.
That said, judicial independence is called a ‘principle’ of law for a reason. A ‘principle’ is a position one takes and stays committed to even in difficult times. If you remain committed to your principles only when it is convenient, it isn’t a principle, but a trend. In the past, the judiciary typically chose the path of least resistance when dealing with critical constitutional issues such as these, thereby being seen as facilitating power. Over the decades, it garnered criticism and lost much face.
One hopes that this time round, unlike its chequered past, it treats judicial independence as the principle it should be, and not as the trend it is now becoming.

• Experts fear catastrophe at Head Muhammadwala
• High flood warning for Kasur, Okara, Bahawalnagar and other cities
• Over 85 Sialkot villages cut off since Aug 26
• Fears of urban flooding as more rain expected from today
• Homes washed away, farmland destroyed in GB’s Deral valley
LAHORE: As the water level continued to rise in the Chenab River at Head Muhammadwala and Sher Shah bridges, the urban centres of Multan and Muzaffargarh were facing a
grave threat
due to the extremely high-level
flood
that had not subsided des­pite the passage of 36 hours.
The National Disaster Management Authority also issued a “high flood” warning for Kasur, Okara, Pakpattan, Burewala, Arifwala and Bahawal­nagar, as water levels continue to increase in the Sutlej River.
Multan Deputy Commi­ssioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said that the flood level in the Chenab River was continuously rising, due to which water had reached the Akbar Flood Bund and the Sher Shah bridge, inundating several villages.
“The situation is likely to worsen due to the joining of the Ravi River and the Chenab,” DC Sindhu said, adding that the water was above 414 feet at Greywala Chowk and showing a rising trend. He said the decision to breach the dyke at Head Muhammadwala would be taken if the 417-feet threshold was crossed. The DC said that a record 400,000 people were relocated to safer areas in the district.
Multan Commissioner Amir Karim Khan said that the water gauge at Head Muhammadwala was recorded at 413.66ft — just a few feet short of the critical level of 417ft. He said the decision to breach the embankment would be based on the water flow speed, intensity, and other factors.
‘Non-technical and incorrect information’
However, the experts ap­­peared alarmed by the situation at Head Muham­madwala, claiming that the critical level was actually lower than 417 feet.
The former irrigation department experts said the technical committee, comprising the irrigation department and other de­­partments, provided non-te­chnical and incorrect in­­­­formation to the administration regarding the bre­­aching section. Accor­dingly, the water level at Head Muhammadwala was set at 417 (above sea level), based on the 1992 flood flow.
However, the bridge had not been constructed at the time and the area was an open floodplain, with no controlled area of the bridge obstructing the flood flow, they said, adding that the 417-feet thr­eshold would increase the pressure on the Nawabpur and Akbar Flood embankments.
Since the government did not reassess the critical level at this gauge following the construction of the bridge, the situation at this head was precarious. The slow discharge from Head Muhammad­w­a­­la caused flooding from Jewana Bangla to Head Muhammadwala, they said, adding that the Ravi flood flow was also stagnant at Sidhnai Head­wo­rks for the same reason.
They urged the authorities to review the critical level to save Multan bef­ore the flood moving from Chiniot towards Trimmu Head­works could merge with the current flood flow.
According to PDMA, the Chenab at Marala Head­w­orks was flowing at 117,369 cusecs. Khanki Headworks was reporting a steady flow of 248,840 cusecs, while Qa­­dirabad Headworks was steady at 385,228 cusecs. The flow at Chiniot Bridge was steady at 554,998 cusecs. The water level at Rivaz Bridge was 520.50 feet; it was rising but remained below its maximum of 526 feet. Trimmu Headworks had a steady flow of 239,545 cusecs. At Head Muhammadwala, the level was steady at 414.00 feet against a maximum of 417.50 feet. The Sher Shah Bridge level was steady at 393.40 feet against a maximum of 393.50 feet.
Indian dams threat
Addressing a press conference, PDMA chief Irfan Ali Kathia said that the water level in Indian dams was continuously rising. He said that New Delhi had issued seven warnings to Pakistan about opening dam gates and three in the last 24 hours. He said that Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab would be affected after the release of more water from Indian dams.
Mr Kathia said that the situation at Head Sindhnai along the Ravi was “problematic” as water levels continued to increase at Jassar as well as Shahdara Headworks. He attributed the increase in the water level to the ‘backwater effect’. The DG said that as many as 3.8 million people had been safely evacuated from flood-affected areas in Punjab. “Massive evacuations have been carried out in the past 24 hours, mainly in Toba Tek Singh, Pir Mahal, Kabir­wala, and Khanewal.”
Sialkot villages cut off
As many as 85 villages of Bajwat, a rural area situated near the Pak-India border, remained cut off from the Sialkot district. Flash floods and incessant rainfall in the catchment area have swept away a bridge.
The residents had been without electricity since August 26 — the day when the devastating rain of over 500mm submerged Sialkot and adjoining areas, including Bajwat, and some other villages in neighbouring Chaprar town. Though the local administration temporarily constructed a Bailey bridge to connect Bajwat with Sialkot, recent flash floods in Tavi and Chenab rivers eroded its foundations, rendering it unusable.
“…Bajwat’s 85 villages are disconnected….despite the fact we have tried hard to restore mobility of the people,” Rana Iqbal Harnah, an MPA from Sialkot, told
Dawn
.
Sialkot Deputy Com­missioner Saba Asghar Ali said that Bajwat has some local markets from where the people were meeting their needs to some ext­ent. She said the administration was making all efforts to help the residents, adding that they were using bikes to access the area as boats could not be used due to the uneven terrain.
A local official, on condition of anonymity, said the situation was dire, particularly due to a prolonged power outage.  Cha­­­­prar town and its three villages have also been affected by floods and rains,” said Muh­am­mad Nafees, the Chaprar union council secretary, situated near Bajwat. Mr Nafees said the supply of various items from Sialkot to Bajwat continued to be disrupted due to the situation, leading to a shortage of essentials.
Flash flood in GB
Meanwhile, a flood

Deral Assistant Com­mis­sioner Waseem Abbas told

QUETTA: At least six people lost their lives in a powerful
bomb explosion
in the border town of Chaman, a suicide bomber targeted a convoy in Kech district, while security forces killed four militants in Khuzdar during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) on Thursday.
Separately, four people, including two Frontier Corps officials, were injured in a grenade attack and firing by unknown armed men in the Mangochar area of Kalat division late in the evening.
Officials said the Chaman blast ripped through a crowded taxi stand near the Pak-Afghan border in the evening, killing four people instantly and injuring two others. The wounded later succumbed to their injuries, raising the death toll to six.
“The explosion took place near makeshift shops,” Assistant Commissioner Chaman Imtiaz Baloch told
Dawn
. Police and Levies forces rushed to the scene and shifted the dead and injured to the district hospital.
“The blast left bodies mangled and body parts scattered,” eyewitness Asghar Achakzai, a local reporter, told
Dawn
by phone.
Police said initial investigations suggested explosives had been planted outside the shops at the taxi stand.
The Balochistan Home Depart­ment confirmed the casualties and ordered an inquiry into the incident.
It asked citizens to cooperate with investigation officials, stressing that the culprits would be brought to justice.
Kech suicide attack
Meanwhile, a convoy travelling from Gwadar to Turbat came under attack in the Dasht-i-Kuddan area of Kech district, around 60 kilometres from Turbat.
Officials said gunmen opened fire on the convoy before a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden pickup into one of the buses.
There was no official word from the local administration or Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) about the incident. It was not immediately clear whether anyone had been killed or injured.
The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack.
Khuzdar operation
Separately, the military’s media wing said on Thursday that security forces killed four militants linked to the “Indian proxy” group Fitna al-Hindustan during an intelligence-based operation in Khuzdar.
“During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in a statement. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the site, it added.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the ISPR said.
Thursday’s attacks come amid a surge in militant activity across Balochistan.
Earlier this week, five militants were killed in Khuzdar. Last week, four militants were also killed during an IBO in Mastung, according to ISPR.
A day earlier, two police stations and a Levies post were targeted in Sherani district, leaving one poli­ce­­man martyred and two Levies personnel injured.

“I have spoken to many bureaucrats who told me that nephews of the chief secretary are involved in occupying the board’s land in these three areas. All are naming an MNA and MPA who happen to be nephews of the chief secretary,” he claimed.
He said as the illegal occupation of the temple’s land story went public, work on it had temporarily been stopped but no heed was being paid to illegal occupation of the land in Bhera and Kot Momin by the board.
Mr Chan further said he believed that the chief secretary would not be directly part of it (illegal occupation of the land).
“However, if the chief secretary’s name is being misused then he should take action against the land grabbers. I want to say that I will not let anyone occupy the state land in my constituency.” When contacted, Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman asked
Dawn
to first go to the area concerned and ask the people (about the matter).
On the other hand, sources said the ETPB’s role remained dubious as how come illegal construction at the temple’s land was made possible.
ETPB secretary Farid Iqbal told
Dawn
that a notice had been issued to those involved in the construction at the site of the non-functional temple and a fine of Rs100,00 imposed on them.
Citing a report of the deputy administrator of the ETPB, he said political colour was being given to this matter because of rivalry among some political elements.

The bodies of three transgender individuals were
recovered
from Karachi’s Memon Goth area after midnight on Sunday, according to Edhi Information Centre. It said the bodies were found riddled with bullet holes and that the deceased were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medicolegal formalities.
The complaint was filed at Memon Goth police station on Sunday under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, registered by a transgender person who lived in the same building as the three victims, they told the complainant on Saturday evening that they were headed to Bahria Town on Super Highway.
“I tried calling them, but they did not answer. I kept calling them until 1am,” the complainant stated in the FIR. Ït was not until I opened WhatsApp that I found they were headed back to Karachi from Nagori Society in Hyderabad, when they were attacked in a forested area on the Super Highway.
“An unknown person, or persons, shot and killed them,” the complainant alleged. “I filed this complaint because unknown people killed them for unknown reasons and legal action needs to be taken.”

, servicing and adopting public-private partnersh­ips by Pakistan Railways were rai­sed during a meeting of the Sen­ate Standing Committee on Railways, which met in Islamabad on Tuesday.
Senator Rubina Khalid, who join­­ed the committee as a member, qu­­estioned the procedure and rationale behind adopting models not widely practiced internationally.
The committee asked the Min­is­try of Railways to provide a thorough briefing on its outsourcing pol­icies and practices in the next meeting.
She also expressed concern over the closure of trains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and called for uniform development of railway infrastructure across all provinces.
Senators express disappointment over minister, senior PR officials’ absence from meeting
Committee Chairman Jam Saiful­lah Khan announced that the next meeting will be held in Peshawar to specifically review railway projects and facilities in the province.
Additionally, Senator Khalid underscored the strategic importance of the Afghan transit trade and stressed that railway access must be extended to Torkham Pass to strengthen regional connectivity.
The committee called for a comprehensive briefing on railway gauges to evaluate which system would best connect Pakistan with neighbouring countries.
Members expressed their disappointment over the absence of the Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi and senior officials, despite prior assurances to ensure compliance.
They noted that the working papers submitted to them were neither complete nor provided 72 hours in advance, as required.
Senator Shahadat Awan said that details of a police report regarding the alleged corruption of billions of rupees were still missing, despite repeated directions from the committee. He termed it highly inappropriate that after 11 meetings, complete information was still not shared with the committee.
Senator Khalid and Senator Kamil Ali Agha endorsed these concerns, stressing that it was unjustified for members to travel from other cities when the ministry failed to provide relevant data.
The chairman reminded that the minister had earlier assured transparent provision of information and directed that in the next meeting, the minister, secretary, Inspector General and DIG Railways must be present to brief the committee in detail. He further instructed that all future working papers be prepared properly.
The committee also discussed the flood situation and was informed that while old bridges had largely withstood the impact, some sectors, including Narowal–Sialkot, were temporarily affected but had since been restored.
Senator Awan also raised the issue of restoring Budhal Express train between Rohri and Jacobabad and the Mandra-Chakwal railway line, stressing that people were forced to spend heavily on road travel due to suspension of these services.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941836/sc-overturns-bhc-relief-to-flour-mills-in-tax-case,SC overturns BHC relief to flour mills in tax case - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has accepted the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) appeal and set aside the Oct 17, 2023 Balochistan High Court (BHC) judgement that had granted tax relief to flour mills.
A three-judge SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi, conclusively settled the long-standing dispute over the tax obligations of flour mills operating across the country.
The controversy began when the Quetta Electric Supply Company, acting as a withholding agent, started collecting ‘Extra Tax and Further Tax’ from flour mills through electricity bills under SROs issued on June 12, 2013, and Sept 17, 2021.
Several flour mills challenged the levy before the BHC.
On Oct 17, 2023, the high court held that flour mills were exempt, relying on Section 13, read with Item No. 19 of the Sixth Schedule to the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
That verdict, however, conflicted with the Lahore High Court’s 2022 judgement in the Waqar Flour Mills case, where this levy on flour mills was upheld under Section 3(5) of the Sales Tax Act, with the SROs declared valid and enforceable.
To resolve the inconsistency, the FBR filed appeals before the Supreme Court.
Representing the FBR, Advocate Hafiz Ehsaan Ahmad Khokhar argued that exemption under Section 13 does not absolve flour mills from their statutory duty to obtain sales tax registration.
Mr Khokhar emphasised that under Sections 2(25), 2(41), and 3(1A) of the Sales Tax Act, every business consuming electricity must obtain a sales tax registration number, contending that the levy under the SROs are lawfully chargeable to non-registered persons and those not on the Active Taxpayers List, as envisaged under Section 2(1).
The mills were represented by Advocate Qamar-uz-Zaman Cheema.
After reviewing the statutory framework, relevant SROs, and the conflicting high court rulings, the Supreme Court categorically rejected the BHC interpretation and upheld the FBR’s stance.

appointment
of Asjad Imtiaz as Indus River System Authority’s (Irsa) federal member from Sindh as he did not possess province’s domicile.
A two-judge constitutional bench headed by Justice Muhammad Karim Khan Agha ruled that the ministry’s notification
issued
in 2022 to appoint Punjab-domiciled Mr Imtiaz as Irsa’s federal member for a period of three years was a flagrant violation of the SHC’s 2017 judgement that ruled that the executive order regarding appointment of the federal member from Sindh was protected under Article 270AA(2) of the Constitution and the federal government was bound to follow it.
The bench issued show-cause notices to the secretaries of establishment division and ministry of water resources for flouting an order of the bench issued last month.
The bench was hearing an application seeking contempt proceedings against both the secretaries for not complying with the judgement of SHC passed in 2017.
Issues show cause notices to secretaries of water resources and establishment divisions
At the outset of hearing, the bench noted that the judgement was passed on May 12, 2017 and the matter had reached finality before the Supreme Court in 2021, but the same has still not been implemented.
It said like the last hearing, both the secretaries and Mr Imtiaz did not appear despite specific directives issued by the bench.
The bench also noted that the secretary ministry of water resources Syed Ali Murtaza was directed to appear and not to be busy elsewhere or otherwise on leave, but it was quite surprising that on Sept 10, he was allowed eight-day ex-Pakistan leave.
It further observed that prima facie, such period/leave was deliberately given to him in order to avoid his appearance before this court and the establishment division was well aware that he had to appear before the bench on Tuesday.
Thereafter, the bench issued show-cause notices to Mr Murtaza and Establishment Secretary Nabeel Ahmed Awan for violating the last order of the bench issued on Aug 18.
It noted that the water recourses secretary had sent a reply to the show-cause notice which clearly indicated that he was aware of the 2017 judgement, yet he has failed to take any action about compliance and relied on an interim stay order passed by the Islamabad High Court despite the fact that the matter had reached finality before the apex court in 2021.
The bench rejected the reply as unsatisfactory and stated in its order: “It is quite astonishing that the Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Water Resources, despite the judgement 12.05.2017 being in field and this matter having reached finality by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, by re-appointing Asjad Imtiaz as Member Irsa (Federal) for a period of three (03) years vide notification dated 08.12.2022.
“We find this to be quite astonishing and flagrant violation of this Court’s orders. It appears that the Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Water Resources, has little interest in complying with this Court’s order as it is bound to do so. Accordingly, the notification dated 08.12.2022 of Asjad Imtiaz issued by the Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Water Resources, is suspended,” it added.
The bench warned if the 2017 judgement was not complied with by the next hearing, the court will have no option but to proceed in accordance with the law as the matter has attained finality before the apex court.
Adjourning the hearing till Oct 22, the bench again directed Mr Murtaza and Mr Imtiaz to appear in person at the next hearing.
Petitioner Ghulam Abbas Laghari had filed an application seeking contempt proceedings against the secretaries of establishment division and ministry of water resources for not complying with the court order passed in 2017.
Meanwhile, another two-judge bench of SHC headed by Justice Muhammad Faisal Kamal Alam on Tuesday summoned the advocate general Sindh for Oct 14 in an identical matter.
The bench was hearing a petition filed by a grower of Sindh, Qurban Maitlo, through his lawyer Barrister Zameer Ghumro against the appointment Mr Imtiaz and also impugned the water availability certificate issued by Irsa for construction of canals on the Indus River. The SHC had already suspended the impugned water availability certificate.

Following the
monsoon floods
across Pakistan, the ministry of national food security and research requested the FAO to lead a comprehensive national geospatial flood impact assessment. The floods have resulted in severe human and economic losses, with widespread casualties, mass displacement, and extensive damage to agriculture.
According to UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), the assessment will provide a district-wise cropland and crop type damage to support planning for disaster response and recovery.
The first assessment is expected to be available next week.
The UNOCHA says a Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) has been initiated in Punjab and data collection is almost complete in eight districts — Sialkot, Muzaffargarh, Kasur, Multan, Bahawalpur, Chiniot, Narowal and Jhang. Five additional districts — Okara, Bahawalnagar, Hafizabad and Gujrat assessments have also started.
The UNOCHA says an additional $500,000 from the Asia and Pacific Humanitarian Fund (APHF) has been planned to be allocated to humanitarian partners working in Punjab.
Last week, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) allocated $5 million for the provision of safe drinking water, food, shelter, hygiene kits, mosquito nets and cash assistance for access to health services, and psychological support.  CERF funds supplemented the $250,000 allocated by AFPH for local NGOs to deliver essential lifesaving interventions in Khyber-Pakhunkhwa.
According to the UNOCHA, with many UN agencies and NGOs having nearly exhausted their funds, there is an urgent need for funds to the Pakistan Humanitarian Fund to meet the most critical humanitarian needs of the affected population.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940424/urban-storm-water-management,Urban storm-water management - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"PAKISTAN has been ravaged by riverine and pluvial
floods
this monsoon season too.
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Hum­a­n­itarian Affairs reports that during the current monsoon season, 785 lives have been lost; the number is increasing with each passing day. July 2025 saw 82 per cent more rain than July 2024, reports the Pakistan Meteorological Department. In Punjab alone,
two million
people have felt the season’s impact; and visuals from KP and Sindh are grim to say the least.
Sadly, it will only
get worse
as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects 26pc faster warming rates till 2050. This means more frequent heatwaves, erratic weather, glacial lake outburst floods and riverine and pluvial floods.
Pakistan’s challenges are multifold; they include an aging infrastructure, fragmented institutions working in silos, and under-resourced local governments, to name a few. Most
urban areas
have non-existent storm-water management, often piggybacking on decaying sewerage systems, and leading to compounded fiascos. For the urban poor living in informal settlements on city margins, the situation is even more dire — when downtowns catch a cold, slums catch fever. Every year, the monsoon triggers disasters that result in life-threatening conditions for the less-privileged urbanites in particular.
As a developing country with limited resources, Pakistan must make smart choices to address the aforementioned ills while improving public service delivery too. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we can learn from global best practices, leading to customised solutions for our local challenges. Globally, there are two approaches when it comes to dealing with storm-water: get rid of it as soon as possible or treat it as an asset instead of viewing it as a threat. The latter approach is reckoned as more progressive, and cities adopting it are referred to as ‘
sponge cities
’. A sponge city essentially acts like a sponge: it absorbs water and can release it whenever needed. This property can resolve a problem faced by our cities: deluges and droughts throughout the year.
Sponge cities are based on blue-green infras­t­r­u­c­ture (BGI), comprising a specially designed network of water bodies and green spaces such as urb­an parks, wetlands, bioswales and water plazas.
The BGI model presents Pakistani urban centres with an opportunity to enhance livability.
BGI, unlike single-purpose grey infrastructure (storm-water drains), is multifunctional and provides ecosystem services through urban nature. This climate infrastructure is not buried underground and provides flood mitigation, storm-water management, urban heat island impact reduction, recreational opportunities as well as enhanced biodiversity.
We present Copenhagen’s example and how the city’s climate adaptation model can help Pakistani cities be climate-proofed for the future. Cop­enhagen has made great strides towards climate resilience using BGI over the last decade or so. The city was jolted by a cloudburst event in 2011, sending shockwaves and losing more than $1 billion in damages. Consequently, the city came up with its pioneer Cloudburst Management Plan, 2012.
The plan serves as a blueprint for the city’s climate adaptation and envisages urban nature as its fundamental pivot. The plan provides a robust system consisting of BGI to manage storm-water on the ground in addition to four underground tunnels. The city found out that its limited sewer capacity led to combined sewer outflows during intense downpours.
The Cloudburst Plan responded to this challenge through a unique idea. Relying on hydraulic modelling, experts divided the city into seven catchment areas based on where it would rain and where the city would want its rainwater to go. The surface system comprises more than 350 projects spr­­­ead over seven catchments. Further, each cat­chment area is divided into cloudburst branches comprising various BGI projects in diffe­rent neighbourhoods. These projects are meant to stop storm-water from entering the sewers as the city expects 30pc more than usual rain in the future.
A Copenhagen climate neighbourhood (building block of the system) comprises streets, courty­ards and parks acting as BGI. With a focus on the water in the neighbourhood, these urban spaces are all connected and have a dual function. The system ensures that rain falling in the neighbourh­o­od can flow through the BGI projects. The water, which cannot infiltrate, has an outlet to the next system. Therefore, the idea is not just to drain water quickly, but to slow it down, store it and use it, turning excess water into an urban asset. These functions to retain, detain and convey storm-water are performed by various cloudburst typologies. For example, parks and plazas are designed to ret­ain storm-water from surrounding rooftops. Green roads delay storm-water conveyance and clo­­­udb­urst boulevards ensure its speedy transportation.
Instead of relying solely on conventional drainage systems, the plan reimagines Copenhagen’s streets, parks and public spaces as dynamic tools for managing storm-water, reducing flood risks, and enhancing urban livability. These BGI projects in Copenhagen are expected to be completed over 30 years, aligning with the city’s broader urban development agenda.
The model presents Pakistani urban centres with an opportunity to enhance urban livability while managing storm-water and urban flooding effectively. It would create synergies amongst government agencies, break management silos as well as provide a systemic approach for cost-effective and integrated sustainable development. Every city with a peculiar water cycle, topography and public participation must chalk out its own unique plan to climate-proof itself through a multifunctional climate infrastructure. This is a crucial moment for Pakistan to propose pragmatic climate-adaptation projects for climate justice funding worldwide. The time to act was yesterday; let’s at least start today. n

According to the
World Health Organisation
, the CCHF, commonly known as Congo Virus, causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. There is no vaccine available for the disease.  Experts say the CCHF virus is primarily transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter.
As per the statement, a lab report confirmed that a 28-year-old butcher from Karachi’s Landhi area had contracted the disease. He developed symptoms on September 24, was admitted to the hospital the same day, and died within hours of admission.
His symptoms included a high-grade fever, cough, shortness of breath, and bleeding from the mouth and rectum, following which a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was carried out, confirming the presence of the virus.
The patient, who was isolated immediately after the test, had a history of animal and tick exposure due to his profession, according to the report.
“The case, reported on September 26, was verified by a surveillance team, which collected details of his contact history and risk factors,” it added.
Sindh Health Department spokesperson Meeran Yousuf told
Dawn.com
, “The case marked the sixth CCHF-related death in the province this year.”
Earlier, fatalities were recorded on
June 17
and 18 in Karachi’s Malir area, on June 30 in Thatta, and on July 17 and August 14, again in Malir.
The disease can spread via human-to-human transmission, from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons, according to the WHO.
The onset of the symptoms is sudden, with fever, muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes, and sensitivity to light.
On
June 18
, a 22-year-old animal handler from the North Waziristan tribal district died of CCHF at the Hayatabad Medical Complex.

Meanwhile, the US Geological Survey reported it as a 5.2-magnitude earthquake 34 kilometres northeast of Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province.
The epicentre of the tremor was close to where a magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit late Sunday night, devastating remote areas in mountainous provinces near the border with Pakistan.
The “quake was felt in the same areas which were affected in Kunar [province] in the first earthquake”, Ehsanullah Ehsan, the disaster management spokesman in the hard-hit province, told

Another dozen people were killed and hundreds were injured in neighbouring Nangarhar province.
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, with dwindling aid since the Taliban seized power in 2021, undermining its ability to respond to disasters.
The devastation could affect “hundreds of thousands”, said United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Afghanistan Indrika Ratwatte.
The PMD earlier reported three more minor quakes in the day: a magnitude 4 in southeastern Afghanistan at 2:50pm at a depth of 97km, a magnitude 5.4 in China’s Xinjiang at 12:59pm at a depth of 10km and a magnitude 4.4 in southeastern Afghanistan at 12:25pm at a depth of 20km.

• Spox avoids addressing Trump’s remarks, says SCO promotes multilateralism, peace
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday emphasised the seriousness of the threat posed to regional peace and stability by Afghanistan-based terrorist groups, calling it a common challenge that required collaborative efforts.
“Groups like Fitna Al-Khwarij represent a common threat to the peace and stability of our region, necessitating collective action to counter their malign influence,” Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said at a weekly media briefing.
The government uses the term to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorist group.
The spokesman was responding to questions about reported Pakistani strikes across the border and comments by Taliban acting Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob, who accused Pakistan of blaming Afghanistan for its own security shortcomings.
Pakistan has long maintained that it faces a persistent threat from militant groups operating out of Afghanistan, including the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). Multiple United Nations Security Council reports have noted the presence of sanctuaries for these groups in Afghanistan, which Islamabad says enable cross-border attacks.
Taliban officials, however, deny the allegations. In a recent media interview, Mullah Yaqoob said Pakistan’s security apparatus was to blame for failing to prevent militant infiltrations.
“If they cross into Pakistan from Afghanistan and travel deep inside Pakistani territory, why aren’t they stopped there? Instead of addressing this, Pakistan unjustly accuses Afghanistan,” he said.
Shafqat Ali dismissed the Taliban defence chief’s remarks as “an exercise in irony”. “It cannot mask the seriousness of this issue,” he said, adding: “The enormity of the matter cannot be diminished by whatever number of statements you issue.”
The FO spokesman said security forces and law enforcement agencies conduct “targeted operations in border regions to safeguard our citizens from terrorist threats”.
“These operations are meticulously planned based on credible and actionable intelligence and executed with precision,” he said, adding that Pakistan respects Afghanistan’s sovereignty and remains committed to dialogue and cooperation.
Expulsion of Afghans
FO spokesman rejected calls to pause the expulsion of Afghans following last weekend’s deadly earthquake in Afghanistan, insisting that deportations would continue and urging Germany to show seriousness in relocating vulnerable refugees.
“This is the global norm, and this is our sovereign decision regarding who we allow to enter or stay in our country. So, any person who’s illegal, we will repatriate that person,” Shafqat Ali said.
He was responding to an appeal by UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, who earlier this week urged Pakistan to suspend its ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’ because of the humanitarian crisis triggered by the earthquake.
“Given the circumstances, I appeal to the government of Pakistan to pause the implementation,” Grandi had said.
Shafqat Ali suggested there would be no extension of the Sept 1 deadline for Afghans to leave, noting that Pakistan already maintains a generous visa policy.
“We are issuing a large number of visas to Afghans under different categories, including visit, business, family, education and medical visas,” he said.
“For Afghanistan, we have a special category under which on-arrival visas are granted for certain medical emergencies. So, what I want to emphasise is that we already have a very liberalised visa regime in place.”
The FO spokesman also pressed Germany to accelerate the relocation of Afghans promised after the Taliban takeover. “We hope that they take it seriously. There is a large group of Afghans in Pakistan which the German side had committed to take to Germany. A number of deadlines have passed,” he said.
Trump’s criticism of SCO summit
The FO spokesman, while sidestepping direct comment on US President Donald Trump’s
criticism
of the gathering, said this week’s Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin promoted multilateralism and the pursuit of peace and prosperity.
“The recent Heads of States meeting and then in the expanded format meeting were very successful. The key message was of multilateralism, common prosperity, peace, security and development,” he noted.
He maintained that the SCO was not designed to work against any country.

They were discovered by the locals from Kuki Hill Torrent near the shrine of Hazrat Sakhi Sarwar Syed Ahmed Sultan in Dera Ghazi Khan.
Hazrat Syed Ahmed Sultan, who arrived in the area in 1077, was martyred along with his family and was buried here. He played a vital role in preaching Islam in the area. Historians note that an ancient temple already existed in the town before the arrival of the saint.
There were also two rest houses called Dhodah Ranas (local call sweet bread Dhodah) on the way towards the ancient temple for devotees or visitors in ancient times. However, now the building with unique architecture has been altered. The third Dhodah Rana was situated in the ancient village Wadore as this village was on the ancient route/road, which leads to Nighah-Moqam or Sakhi Sarwar and goes as far as Afghanistan. Mughal King Babur had also used this ancient route.
Some days back ruins of an ancient check post were also discovered along the bed of hill torrent Kuki or Sakhi Sarwar.
Deputy Commissioner Usman Khalid confirmed that the coins, belonging to different centuries/dynasties and eras, were recovered and they were handed over to the archaeology department. A departmental team, led deputy director archaeology Sulaiman Tanveer, visited the site and secured the discovery while preparations were also underway to begin excavations at the torrent bed.
Historians state that the present-day town of Sakhi Sarwar, once known as Nigaha and Moqam, has a rich Islamic as well as pre-Islamic history as it was located along an ancient trade route. Ghazi Ghat at Indus river, they add, was formerly known as Pattan Moqam.

PTI alleges rigging
The turnout remained very low at the start of the day in the metropolis as polling stations largely wore a deserted look, but voters started to come out of their homes when the polling time neared conclusion.
PTI Karachi president Raja Azhar accused the PPP of carrying out widespread rigging and said that its MPAs and elected local government representatives freely visited almost all the polling stations with their armed guards and supporters, disturbing the polling process and influencing the polling staff.
He alleged that while the number of votes cast at a polling station (Al-Hamza School) in UC-8 (Saeedabad) Baldia Town was 149, the provisional result showed that PPP’s candidate secured 282 votes from the same polling station.

Guddu Barrage
on Tuesday (tomorrow), bringing
flows
of more than 800,000 cusecs.
After receiving a briefing at the Flood Emergency Centre on Sunday, he told the media that preparations and the evacuation of vulnerable riverine populations had been accelerated.
He was accompanied by Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon, Rehabilitation Minister Makhdoom Mahboob, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah and other officials.
The chief minister said that commissioners had begun making announcements across katcha (riverine) areas to ensure residents vacated their homes and moved to safer locations.
CM says over 800,000 cusecs of water likely to displace 324,000 people; stresses unity, warns against misinformation during flood emergency
He confirmed that provincial ministers were stationed on both the right and left banks of the Indus to directly supervise evacuations.
Mr Shah revealed that approximately 324,000 people were likely to be displaced, of whom 128,000 had already left their homes. However, most evacuees had chosen not to stay at relief camps, with some relocating to embankments. So far, over 40,000 patients have been treated, while 900,000 livestock animals have been vaccinated.
He said measures taken to drain water from the Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) were expected to prove beneficial. He also noted that bridges were being constructed on the Indus Highway to facilitate movement.
Addressing the comparative flood situation in Punjab, the chief minister said that conditions there were far more severe.
“At this time, the real need for support is in Punjab. Our health minister has already offered medical assistance to them,” he said.
He clarified that reports of 40 villages being inundated in Sehwan referred to katcha settlements that are always at risk during floods.
Emphasising unity during national crises, Mr Shah recalled that the nation had stood together during the May border confrontation with India.
The chief minister assured that all relief and healthcare camps had been geo-tagged, with boats, supplies and staff in place.
“Our preparations are complete. The rain in Sindh is manageable, and rainfall in Koh-i-Suleman is not so intense as to immediately flood the river. But we remain cautious,” he noted.
Referring to recent rains in Karachi, he pointed out that drainage measures had cleared the city within hours on Aug 19.
He expressed confidence that Sindh would withstand the flood, while urging the public to avoid misinformation and cooperate fully with the authorities.
He acknowledged the active oversight of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and President Asif Ali Zardari, noting that both leaders were being frequently updated on the situation.
Mr Shah clarified that Sindh did not currently require federal financial aid, though the prime minister and chief secretary remained engaged in coordination efforts.
He added that urban flooding could not be entirely prevented, but the key was to drain water within hours — something the provincial government had managed to do successfully after the recent rains.
The chief minister concluded by urging the public to ignore misinformation, highlighting common challenges during flood situations, and noting action taken against criminal elements in katcha regions.
Over 128,000 shifted to safer locations: Sharjeel
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said all cabinet members, designated focal persons, and members of the provincial and national assemblies are also present in the field and personally monitoring the relief measures.
In a statement, he said that 128,057 people have so far been shifted to safer places from 167 UCs in 15 districts of the province.
He said that 6,288 people were relocated in the last 24 hours. He added that 39,576 victims have been provided medical assistance at 154 fixed and mobile health camps set up by the Sindh government, including 5,772 people treated in the last 24 hours alone.
He said that arrangements have also been made for the safety of livestock. In the past 24 hours, 9,384 cattle were moved to safe areas, bringing the total to 370,161 cattle. In addition, 70,267 cattle were vaccinated and treated in the last 24 hours, while a total of 878,796 cattle have been vaccinated and treated so far.

The development comes three days after a special judge central
completed
the cross-examination of the two key witnesses, an appraiser named Sohaib Abbasi and the former prime minister’s personal secretary, Inamullah Shah, in an over six-hour-long proceeding inside Adiala Jail.
The
case
pertains to Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi retaining an expensive Bulgari jewellery set gifted by the Saudi royal family — including a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings — at a low price, causing significant loss to the exchequer.
One of the witnesses, Sohaib Abbasi, confessed to undervaluing the Bulgari set at Rs5 million. He did so under the pressure of Imran Khan’s former personal secretary, Inamullah Shah, he claimed. Shah is the other key witness who has testified in the case.
In his testimony, Abbasi said that he was “handed over the responsibility of the assessment of the set on May 25, 2022 by the Section Officer of [the] Cabinet Division.”
Abbasi went on to say that Shah visited him and told him “that the two accused facing trial want to retain the jewellery set”, demanding that the assessment should be upto Rs5m.
Abbasi alleged that he was told by Shah that he would be blacklisted from every government department if he refused to cooperate, so he undervalued the jewellery set and submitted a false report.
Abbasi said that he joined the investigation on May 23, 2024 and requested a pardon in the case for undervaluing the jewellery set.
Shah confirmed the allegation, stating that, “I asked Sohaib Abbasi to make [an] undervalued assessment (of the set) and he agreed to that,” adding that he remained in Abbasi’s office for 30-45 minutes during his visit for the jewellery set under question.
The copies of both testimonies are available with
Dawn.com.
Shah also told the court that he was receiving double salaries while working for PTI and the government at the same time. In his testimony, he said, “I was appointed Comptroller of the PM house [from] 2019 to 2021,” but then Shah reveals that, “In that very time, I was also receiving salary additionally from PTI Central Secretariat.”
As per Shah’s testimony, he was removed from his post in the same year, not because of receiving double salary, but “due to Bushra Bibi’s disapproval”. Shah believed that Bushra Bibi suspected Shah’s brother of having close ties with former PTI leader Jahangir Tareen.
In July last year, an Islamabad court
prohibited
the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) from pursuing the Toshakhana reference against Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, transferring the case to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) court.
The case was transferred to a Special Judge Central, who will also decide on Imran and Bushra Bibi’s bail applications.
Imran Khan, imprisoned since August 2023, is currently serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case, along with his wife. He also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.",2025-09-18,Tahir Naseer,807,0.000121

“Any other interpretation of Section 182 of the PPC would re­­sult in multiplying criminal litigation arising out of the same proceedings and would open the floodgates for filing frivolous ca­­ses in every matter where the complainant could not succeed for reasons such as jurisdictio­nal defects, limitation, insufficient evidence, or benefit of dou­bt,” observed Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi in a 10-page order.
Justice Abbasi, sitting on a two-judge Supreme Court bench, was hearing an appeal filed by Ali Adnan Sheikha against the May 29 order of a judge of the Sindh High Court (SHC). The case essentially revolved around the question of who was competent to initiate proceedings under Section 182 of the PPC.
Rules action under Section 182 of PPC requires written complaint by public servant
The judge observed that cognisance by a magistrate in the given case could only have been taken on a written complaint from the concerned police officer, whereas the ex-officio justice of peace had no locus standi or authority to direct the filing of a complaint under Section 182 of the PPC. The ruling thus clarified the jurisdictional boundaries between magistrates, police officers, and justices of peace.
Through his appeal, Mr Shei­kha had sought action against respondents Muzza­mil Ali Sheikha and Mustansar Ali Sheikha, alleging they lodged a false FIR and gave false evidence against him and his late father some 20 years earlier, a matter which had caused prolonged litigation and personal distress.
The Supreme Court, however, upheld both the SHC’s May 29 ruling and the Sessions Court decision, which had refused to direct the police to register a case under Section 182 of the PPC against the respondents, making it clear that mere allegations of a false FIR could not automatically justify fresh criminal proceedings.
In its ruling, the SC emphasised that under Section 195 of the Criminal Procedure Code, courts are barred from taking cognisance of offences under Sections 172-188 of the PPC, including giving false information under Section 182, unless a written complaint is filed by the concerned public servant. The provision was described as a safeguard against misuse of the criminal justice system.
While dismissing the appeal, Justice Abbasi also imposed a cost of Rs25,000 on the petitioner, stating that the SHC judge had ably addressed all factual and legal issues in line with the law, and that the impugned judgement suffered from neither factual error nor legal infirmity.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943033/pakistan-iaea-sign-country-framework,"Pakistan, IAEA sign country framework - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) signed the fifth Country Programme Framework (CPF) for 2026-2031 on the sidelines of the ongoing IAEA General Conference in Vienna on Wednesday.
The framework was signed by PAEC Chairman, Dr Raja Ali Raza Anwar, and IAEA Deputy Director-General and Head, Department of Technical Cooperation, Hua Liu on behalf of their respective sides.
The CPF 2026-2031 stands as a testament to the enduring partnership between Pakistan and the IAEA. Its implementation will strengthen Pakistan’s socio-economic development and reinforce its role as a responsible member state committed to the global mission of the IAEA, a press release of PAEC says.
The country programme outlines national priorities where nuclear science and technology will directly support socio-economic development. It builds on decades of collaboration and aligns with Pakistan’s development agenda and international commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals.
CPF 2026-31 reinforces Pakistan’s role as responsible member state committed to agency’s global mission
Covering three technical cooperation cycles, it identifies five key areas: food and agriculture, human health and nutrition, climate change and water resource management, nuclear power, and radiation and nuclear safety.
In agriculture, which contributes nearly a quarter of GDP and employs more than a third of the workforce, nuclear techniques will be used to boost crop yields, strengthen pest control, improve livestock health, and enhance food safety. Pakistan’s participation in the IAEA’s Atoms4Food initiative demonstrates its commitment to food security and climate-resilient farming.
In health, rising cancer cases and non-communicable diseases make healthcare a central focus. Through the CPF, Pakistan will expand cooperation with the IAEA in nuclear medicine, radiation oncology, medical physics, and radiopharmaceuticals.
The network of 20 Atomic En­­ergy Cancer Hospitals (AECHs), already serving over a million patients annually, will be further equipped with advanced therapies, precision diagnostics, and locally produced radiopharmace­uticals for affordable treatment.
In the environmental domain, Pakistan is among the most climate-vulnerable countries and faces severe water scarcity and extremely unpredictable weather conditions. Nuclear techniques, especially isotope hydrology, will be applied to monitor water resources, improve irrigation efficiency, and support resilience against climate change. Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology, as an IAEA collaborating centre, will play a central role in applying these techniques.
In energy, nuclear power currently contributes over 18pc of annual electricity generation, with six operational plants and another under construction at Chashma. The CPF focuses on plant life management, waste management, non-destructive testing, and safe decommissioning,  while meeting Pakistan’s targets for greenhouse gas reduction by 2030.
In safety, the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority will continue strengthening oversight of nuclear activities. The IAEA support will enhance capabilities in emergency preparedness, radioactive waste disposal, safe transport, and the use of artificial intelligence in regulation. These steps safeguard workers, the public, and the environment, while ensuring compliance with international safety standards.
The CPF underlines Pakistan’s advocacy for gender equality, emphasising women’s participation in science.
At the signing ceremony, PAEC chairman said that the signing of Country Programme Framework reaffirms Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to the peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology.
Mr Hua Liu welcomed Pakistan’s strong engagement, describing the CPF as a shared vision for sustainable development through peaceful nuclear cooperation.

He was initially enga­ged by former Islamabad High Court Bar Assoc­ia­tion (IHCBA) president Riasat Ali Azad to defend the five judges’ case, but that petition was withdrawn by his successor. Mr Azad, however, retained him as counsel while filing another identical petition through four former IHCBA presidents.
The Supreme Court’s Registrar Office on Monday raised administrative objections to the petitions separately filed by the five sitting IHC judges. The judges had appeared in person before the Supreme Court last Friday to institute constitutional petitions challenging the exercise of administrative powers by the IHC chief justice.
In their pleas, the judges sought a declaration that the  administrative powers of the IHC chief justice could not be exercised in  a manner that undermined judicial authority. They argued that once a  bench was seized of a matter, the CJ-IHC was not empowered to transfer  cases, reconstitute the bench, or exclude available judges from the  roster at will.
According to the objections, the petitioners invoked the apex court’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but the grievances raised were of an individual nature and thus not maintainable in view of the 1998 Zulfiqar Mehdi case. In that judgement, the Supreme Court had held that Article 184(3) could not be pressed into service for redress of personal grievances.

In a statement, Nankana police said that the incident took place in Sangla Hill and that two people were killed and one was injured; the latter was moved to the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad.
“As soon as the incident was reported, Nankana DPO (District Police Officer) Faraz Ahmed reached the spot,” the statement read, quoting a police spokesperson. “The scene of the incident was inspected, and orders were issued for the immediate arrest of the suspects involved.”
The statement added that the DPO visited the victims’ families and vowed that the suspects would “be arrested and brought to justice as per the law”.
Later, another statement from Nankana Police confirmed that following an operation in Sangla Hill, two of the suspects were arrested.
“A successful police operation was carried out under the leadership of DPO Faraz Ahmed,” the second statement read. “Two suspects involved in the incident were arrested, and further action is underway.”
A first information report (FIR) was filed on September 7 against four nominated suspects and two unidentified assailants under Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (murder) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

.
The complainant, who was at the scene, alleged in the FIR that the suspects approached his sons’ fruit carts on Sunday evening to buy some fruit. The vendors refused to sell, claiming that the suspects would not pay for the items. This dispute escalated, with the suspects allegedly abusing the fruit vendors.
“The suspects drew their weapons and shot one of my sons in the hand and the left side of his chest,” the complainant alleged. “His brother was shot twice in the chest, while my third son was shot once in the arm and three times in the stomach.”
According to the FIR, the complainant and other people tried to transport the victims to THQ Hospital in Sangla Hill, but one of the deceased succumbed to his wounds on the way, while the other was pronounced dead upon arrival.
The third victim was in critical condition, so he was referred to Allied Hospital in Faisalabad for treatment.

Pakistan and Afghanistan have
witnessed
an improvement in bilateral relations after taking steps to improve ties, such as the
revival
of the Joint Coordination Committee and
upgrading
diplomatic ranks.
This is the first ever gathering of political opponents of the Afghan Taliban since their
takeover
of Afghanistan in 2021, which organisers insist is “not against the Taliban government.”
They argued that the primary aim of the moot was to “promote inclusive and constructive discussions among leaders, including men and women from diverse segments of society in Afghanistan, to develop a shared understanding and identify common principles for Afghanistan’s future stability, inclusivity, and peaceful settlement,” the organisers said in a statement.
The dialogue was previously
scheduled
on Aug 25-26 but was postponed, apparently over criticism by some known personalities, including Zalmay Khalilzad, the former United States special envoy. Khalilzad had termed the meeting “unwise” due to the participation of some who oppose the Taliban.
“Afghan citizens are entitled to their political views, but Pakistan’s seeming support of them by hosting their conference is hugely unwise and an intended provocation,” he wrote on X.
Former Afghan parliamentarian Fawzia Koofi opposed the remarks, saying, “Isn’t it time to let us craft what is good for us?”
The first day of the closed-door meeting was dedicated to Afghan leaders to “engage openly, exchange perspectives and define shared principles for stability, rule of law, and reaffirming the support to women’s rights and inclusion”, according to the organisers.
Dawn.com
has seen a list of 37 Afghans invited to the event. They were part of the previous governments of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, including governors, ministers, lawmakers and women activists.
A participant said some of the invitees were not attending the meeting due to visa issues.
“The aim of this timely and important dialogue is to promote an inclusive dialogue among diverse groups of Afghan leaders (women and men) alongside Pakistani counterparts to foster inclusive dialogue, mutual understanding and lasting cooperation,” the organisers said.
Women for Afghanistan (WFA) and the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute (Sassi) University jointly held the first Regional Dialogue titled “Towards Unity and Trust”.
Koofi, who leads WFA, lives in exile and has organised a series of meetings, mainly comprising
women
activists against the Taliban policies. She is one of the critics of Taliban rule. Dr Maria Sultan, a defence analyst, heads Sassi.
On the second day, on September 30th, a Joint Pak-Afghan Session will hold “focused discussions aimed at building trust, identifying common ground and advancing a people-centric approach to address regional challenges”.
The organisers, while explaining the objectives of the dialogue, say that the event is aimed at strengthening cooperation between Afghan and Pakistani leaders.
The dialogue will also promote sustainable development, stability and peace rooted in shared values and highlight the importance of women’s participation and inclusive governance. The gathering would encourage regional cooperation with a focus on economic development and trust-building, the statement added.
“The dialogue underscores a simple truth: peace between people leads to peace between nations. By prioritising dialogue, inclusivity and cooperation, WFA and SASSI University believe this initiative can pave the way for stronger, more mutually beneficial relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, grounded in unity and trust.“
In addition, the event will be helpful in fostering a deeper understanding between the people of the two nations for a more sustained development and peace in the region.
“The commonality and the importance of the dialogue and the process stems from the need that Afghans must have the space to speak, engage and think together to promote their common values and interests for their country and their people,“ it added.
The dialogue will also serve to identify common grounds for cooperation between Afghan leaders and their Pakistani counterparts on an engagement basis of developing people-centric approaches to find common solutions for regional challenges and to build trust and stability, the statement said.
“We believe that a more people-centric approach focused on economic development and regional cooperation will lead to an enhanced and meaningful relationship between the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.”
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar visited Kabul in July, where an
agreement
was signed for the Pakistan, Uzbek­istan and Afghanistan railway project to boost regional connectivity. Later that month, Dar said Pakistan received “recent assurances” from Afghan authorities that the neighbouring country’s soil would not be
used
for terrorism.

In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the operation was carried out in the Kulachi area upon the presence of “
khawarij
”.
The state uses the term
Fitna al Khwarij
to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as
Fitna al Hindustan
to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the
khwarij
location and [as a result], seven Indian sponsored
khwarij
, including three Afghan National
khwarij
and two suicide bombers, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.
The statement added that Pakistan expects the interim Afghan government, run by the Afghan Taliban, to uphold its responsibilities and deny the use of its soil to carry out acts of terror.
Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have soured over the use of the latter’s territory to stage attacks. Earlier this week, Pakistan
warned
the UN Security Council that terrorist groups operating from sanctuaries inside Afghanistan pose the gravest threat to its national security. Kabul denies the allegations.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored
kharji
found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Earlier this week, security forces killed 31 terrorists in
two separate IBOs

A two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC, headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha, said that such a ban violates various constitutional provisions, specifically the fundamental rights to a fair trial, freedom of association and freedom to practice one’s profession.
It also advised the lawyers to file a complaint before the SHC if the KBA harassed or prevented them from handling such cases and the court will review these complaints to determine whether such restrictions violate Article 10-A of the
Constitution
.
The bench in its order said, “We pass this order in an effort to maintain a balance between the parties. Any member of the Karachi Bar Association who wishes to act in cases involving the murder or rape of a family member of an advocate shall not be prevented from doing so, as under the law they have every right to represent such cases.”
Ban on representing people in cases against member of legal fraternity violates constitutional provisions, bench remarks
It was hearing a petition filed by a lawyer against the KBA and others and the petitioner contended that he was forced to withdraw his vakalatnama (power of attorney) from a bail application for his client since a lawyer was complainant in the case side and petitioner was pressured by the KBA and other lawyers, who were allegedly using their positions to extort money from people by lodging false FIRs.
He also submitted that a resolution passed by the KBA in March last year, barring its members from pleading the cases against the lawyers and their family members, was unconstitutional because it discriminated against litigants who were up against advocates.
The bench in its order also noted that KBA president Amir Nawaz Warraich turned up and acknowledged that the resolution passed by the KBA on March 12, 2024, apparently to violate fundamental rights outlined in the Constitution, particularly Articles 10-A, 17 and 18.
He further emphasised that members of the KBA cannot be prohibited from appearing in such cases.
“If a member of the Bar chooses to act in a case involving other members of the bar, they cannot be restricted or prevented from doing so and shall remain free to act according to their own discretion and the mandates of the Constitution under Article 10-A, which specifically provides that an accused has the right to appoint counsel of their own choice. We place our faith and trust in the words of the President KBA”, the bench in its order added.
It also directed the KBA not to pass any resolution in future restricting any member from acting in a case where other members of the KBA were involved and no coercion or threats must be made against any member who chooses to act for such accused.
The KBA president also assured the bench that if any member of the KBA attempted to pressure or intimidate a lawyer who acts against the March 2024 resolution, the association would take disciplinary action against them.
The bench said, “In view of the above facts and circumstances of the case, and based on the statement of the President of KBA, it is ruled that the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) cannot prohibit its members from taking on cases that involve other KBA members. Such a ban violates the Constitution of Pakistan, specifically the fundamental rights to a fair trial (Article 10-A), freedom of association (Article 17), and freedom to practice one’s profession (Article 18)”.
“The KBA President admitted the unconstitutionality of the previous resolution and committed to ensuring lawyers can act freely. He also promised to take disciplinary action against any member who harasses or pressures a lawyer for handling such a case”, the bench concluded.

Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafiq told
Dawn.com
about the incident and said that the dead and injured were transported to Khar Bajaur District Headquarters Hospital.
“Initial reports suggest that a mortar shell exploded in the field, killing the young men,” he said, adding that the deceased ranged in age between 13 and 18.
Meanwhile, Nisar Baaz Khan, a member of the provincial assembly (MPA) from Bajaur, condemned the incident in a
statement
on social media and claimed that according to local residents, a quadcopter hit the village and killed innocent civilians.
“What crime had these innocent flower-like children committed? What purpose is being served by staining the earth with their innocent blood?” he was quoted as asking.
“The state institutions and provincial government have repeatedly claimed that various areas of Mamond (tehsil) have been cleared. If that is true, then on what grounds are drone strikes being conducted in these villages and settlements?”
The MPA questioned why operations are being carried out in the area when the authorities claim there are no terrorists there.
“Are the lives of our children so cheap that they can be taken so easily?”
He continued: “For decades, our people have been killed in the name of counter terrorism; their homes were destroyed and now innocent lives are being targeted once again.”
Last week, security forces carried out an
airstrike
in KP’s Tirah area, which resulted in four homes being destroyed and killed civilians, including children.
A statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Secretariat said CM Ali Amin Gandapur met a delegation from the district following the incident with PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi, the KP chief secretary, additional chief secretary (home), Peshawar commissioner and other officials also present in the meeting that reviewed the law and order situation in the “context of the unfortunate incident” that occurred in Tirah.
“Martyrdom of civilians in the incident is regrettable and condemnable. Martyrdom of civilians as a result of operations against terrorists is unacceptable,” the statement quoted CM Gandapur as saying.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said it was “deeply shocked” to hear about reports of the killing of several civilians caused by alleged “aerial bombing” in Tirah, and demanded a probe into the matter.
It demanded that “the authorities carry out an immediate and impartial inquiry into the incident and hold to account those responsible”.",2025-09-27,Umar Bacha,667,0.00011

“What we need to do is unlock that potential to turn it into a fruitful engagement that takes our relationship to new heights,” he said while speaking at a programme organised by the English Speaking Union of Pakistan (ESUP) at a local hotel here on Saturday.
“Malaysia takes pride in its association with Pakistan since 31 August 1957, when we gained independence. Pakistan was one of the earliest countries to recognise Malaysia as a nation. Justice Abdul Hamid of Pakistan also helped Malaysia in drafting its constitution. It goes to show how close a brotherly and sisterly relationship Malaysia and Pakistan enjoy,” he said.
“We have almost one hundred thousand Pakistanis diaspora living in Malaysia, who are working there and remitting money back to Pakistan, which also helps us develop our economy. It is by far the largest diaspora in Asia, living side by side with other communities in Malaysia, while also enjoying a good income,” he said.
“Malaysians and Pakistanis share many commonalities that bind us together. I have been in Pakistan since January 2023 and enjoyed every moment of being here. I can feel the genuine warmth of the people. We need to portray this warmth to the world. For instance, there is the tourism industry here, for which you cannot depend solely on domestic tourists.
PM Shehbaz to visit Kuala Lumpur next month, says high commissioner
This year, Malaysia has already recorded the arrival of 25 million tourists. Tourism is one of the largest sectors of our economy in terms of revenue and employment. We can share our knowledge of how to expand tourism with Pakistan,” the high commissioner pointed out.
He said that next month Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will be visiting Malaysia on the invitation of his counterpart, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
“His visit will open a new chapter in our relationship with Pakistan. Anwar Ibrahim also visited Pakistan last year in October. He had also visited Karachi during his youth, when he fell in love with Allama Iqbal’s poetry,” he said.
Currently, there are more than 5,000 Pakistani students in Malaysia. Before Covid-19, the number stood between 15,000 and 20,000.
He also said that Malaysia and Pakistan have elevated their relationship to a strategic partnership.
“We are not just friends. We are partners in terms of development. Pakistan is the third largest trading partner of Malaysia in South Asia, registering about 1.8 billion dollars in trade volume last year. Of course, we are not content with that figure as we want the relationship to go further. The number one trade partner with Malaysia right now is India, and after that comes Bangladesh,” he said.
“Malaysia is right in the middle of the ASEAN region, with 10 member states. The population base of ASEAN is 670 million people, so I would like to invite more Pakistani business entities to come and look at Malaysia as your investment destination.
“We are also investing in Pakistan. We are in the finance sector, with one of our banks, Maybank, operating here. Our petroleum company was also here earlier, and we are asking it to look at Pakistan again in terms of energy sector investment. Our national power generation company is also operating one of the power plants in Lahore.
We have our telecommunications company investing here with 2,000 cellphone towers. Last year, we managed to bring our airline AirAsia here,” he said, adding that Batik Air Malaysia also operates in Pakistan.
“So connectivity is not a problem. It is not an issue to fly to Malaysia. There are also PIA flights to Malaysia. Our ties are getting stronger. We need to leverage our many commonalities,” he concluded.

The accused was presented before a court, which granted four days’ physical remand on Friday for further investigation.
The remand was approved on the police’s request after the court expressed satisfaction that more inquiry was required in the sensitive case.
A police spokesman said a shroud was found near the grave of the girl in the last week of August. Following the discovery, Dhamial police launched an investigation and arrested the suspect accused of desecrating the grave. According to initial findings, the suspect dug up the grave for witchcraft purposes and then attempted to cover it again.
Police immediately responded to the information and had the grave exhumed. No direct evidence of desecration of the body was initially observed. However, forensic reports are awaited for a conclusive determination. Samples were collected during the exhumation, the spokesman added.
The arrest posed a challenge, for which special teams were formed. Police said they worked tirelessly using technical and human intelligence to trace the suspect. Once forensic reports are received, the accused will be charged with solid evidence, and all legal formalities will be completed to ensure punishment for the crime.
A medical board, accompanied by a judicial magistrate, conducted the exhumation of the girl’s grave in Girja Road graveyard. The girl had been buried three days earlier. Samples from her body were collected for DNA and forensic analysis.
Police confirmed that no signs of violence or injuries were found on the body. Nevertheless, a case was registered for desecration of the grave and tampering with the remains.
Zafar Iqbal, father of the girl, lodged the initial complaint. He stated that his daughter died on August 26.
When he visited the grave the following morning for fateha, he found the grave disturbed and the shroud lying in a nearby mansion.
Upon receiving the report, City Police Officer Khalid Hamdani ordered legal action, considering all aspects of the case. Police later sought court approval for exhumation and the appointment of a medical board to establish facts without disturbing the grave unnecessarily.
When exhumation began, the girl’s head and parts of her body became visible, as though the soil had been filled hastily. Her lower torso remained under stone slabs, and the body was without a shroud. According to sources, decomposition had already begun as the body had been buried for three days. Samples were collected before the body was reburied.
A senior police official said the exhumation and postmortem were completed, with tissues and samples sent to the Forensic Science Agency for DNA and other tests. He confirmed that the grave had indeed been tampered with, and a case was registered against unidentified suspects.
As the investigation progressed, police traced the suspect, who turned out to be a black magic practitioner from Mansehra. He was arrested and remanded into custody for four days to aid further investigation.

transferring
Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s
case
.
The transfer came after Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan initiated contempt proceedings against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet.
The larger bench, comprising Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro, Justice Mohammad Azam Khan and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas, will hear on Sept 10 a petition filed by Dr Fowzia Siddiqui seeking the release of her sister, Dr Aafia Siddiqui, from a US prison.
On July 21, Justice Sardar Ejaz had
issued
contempt notices to the prime minister and the entire cabinet over non-compliance with the court’s directions. However, the registrar’s office
did not execute
the notices because the judge was not included in the duty roster approved by the chief justice.
Subsequently, the IHC reconstituted its benches and formed four specialised division benches, including one to hear tax references comprising Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz. As a result, the cases pending before both judges were reassigned to other judges.
Four judges to consider three key questions raised by registrar’s office while transferring the case
On Sept 1, Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas took up Dr Fowzia’s petition. However, as the registrar’s report had recommended that a larger bench should address questions concerning the validity of the July 21 hearing, Justice Minhas referred the matter to the chief justice.
The central issue identified was that Justice Sardar Ejaz’s bench was not authorised to hear cases on July 21. The weekly roster approved by the chief justice had not assigned him any bench duties that day, and the official summer vacation roster also listed him as being on leave.
The registrar’s report noted that the IHC itself has previously held that determination of benches is the “exclusive administrative prerogative of the Hon’ble Chief Justice”.
It further cited rulings of the Supreme Court of India, which has held that no judge can direct listing of cases in conflict with the chief justice’s orders, and of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which has ruled that benches may only hear cases formally fixed before them and cannot self-select matters.
The report suggested placing before a larger bench three questions: whether a judge can self-assign a case; whether an approved sitting roster can be violated by a judge; and whether the chief justice must obtain consent from benches before consolidating identical petitions.
Acting on these recommendations and the serious questions raised, the IHC chief justice constituted the four-judge larger bench now tasked with hearing the matter.

Gandapur
said
a day earlier that projects like the construction of Kalabagh Dam were necessary for the “sake of the future generation”, but also added that prior to such initiatives, reservations of all stakeholders, including provinces, should be addressed. Doubling down on his comments, today, he said that the very important national project was being stopped because of politics.
“Not building the Kalabagh Dam is unfair to the country and to our children’s future,” he said. Gandapur explained that the dam would be good for not just Punjab, but also for Sindh and KP. He called for all parties to talk together and find a solution.
Reacting to his remarks, PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro said that Kalabagh Dam’s construction was not just an issue for the PPP and that the Sindh, KP and Balochistan assemblies had passed resolutions against it in the past.
“This is not just about the PPP, but the entire province. Maybe Ali Amin
sahib
is unaware of this history or maybe he was not [active] in politics back then,” he added. Khuhro said Sindhis considered the waters of the Indus their lifeblood and any mention of Kalabagh elicited negation.
He said CM Gandapur should be questioned why the PTI government did not fast-track and complete the Bhasha dam and other such projects
PTI leader Asad Qaiser also downplayed Gandapur’s support as his “personal opinion” and not the party’s policy in a post on X.
“We do not believe that there is any need for Kalabagh Dam at this time. At this time, smaller dams can also be built … I think that it is not good to unnecessarily stir up controversial issues.”
The Awami National Party (ANP) and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) also rejected Gandapur’s remarks.
ANP chief Aimal Wali Khan stated that the Kalabagh Dam was not a solution to recurring floods in the country.
JUI-F KP spokesperson Abdul Jalil Jan termed the project a “dead horse” and questioned CM Gandapur about his earlier claim of constructing 350 dams.
Meanwhile, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan welcomed CM Gandapur’s proposal, emphasising that Kalabagh, along with other new dams, should be built with the consensus and consultation of all provinces.
He asserted that all four provincial assemblies and chief ministers must jointly find a solution to this pressing national issue.
Appreciating Gandapur’s support for the Kalabagh Dam, he noted that the construction of new dams was vital to safeguard against future water shortages and natural disasters as well as floods.
He stated that new dams would help to save trillions of rupees worth of water from going to waste. “Floods are no longer the issue of a single province; it has become a challenge for the entire country,” he added.
The minister highlighted that Pakistan as a whole was facing the adverse impacts of climate change, while the recent torrential rains in Gilgit-Baltistan, KP and Punjab had caused massive loss of lives and property.
He stressed that the immediate construction of small dams in all four provinces had become unavoidable and must be pursued on an urgent basis.
The minister further said that the construction of small dams required a collective national effort and a comprehensive policy framework at the national level, as fragmented approaches could not resolve such critical national challenges.",2025-09-02,Imtiaz Ali,894,0.000127

of Afghan refugees will be conducted in a transparent, well-organised and dignified manner, ensuring the self-respect of every individual.
“Special care will be extended to women, children, and the elderly Afghan refugees. Any disrespectful behaviour during the process will result in strict disciplinary action,” he said.
He made these remarks while presiding over a high-level meeting on Thursday that reviewed the repatriation process of Afghan refugees and the law and order situation in Qila Abdullah district.
The chief minister stressed that the provincial government is implementing the federal policy on repatriation in close coordination with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
The meeting was attended by Chief Secretary Shakeel Qadir Khan, Additional Chief Secretary Home Hamza Shafqaat, Principal Secretary Babar Khan, Inspector General of Police Muhammad Tahir, Levies Director General Abdul Ghaffar Magsi, Quetta Division Commissioner Shahzeb Kakar and Commissioner for Afghan Refugees Balochistan Arbab Talib. The Zhob DIG, deputy commissioners and district police officers of Qila Abdullah and Chaman also participated via video link.
Hamza Shafqaat briefed the meeting on the repatriation process and security arrangements.
The chief minister issued clear directives that women, children and elderly persons must be given special attention and that any humiliating or disrespectful behaviour would not be tolerated under any circumstances. He warned that complaints of insulting conduct would lead to immediate action against the officials concerned.
He instructed that maximum assistance and facilitation must be ensured during the repatriation process, including the temporary recruitment of female security personnel to assist women. He underlined that the government’s foremost priority is to complete the repatriation process while upholding human dignity.
The meeting also reviewed the law and order situation in Qila Abdullah. The chief minister ordered that all criminal elements in the district be eliminated without delay, with indiscriminate operations carried out regardless of the jurisdiction of Levies or police. CM Bugti directed the divisional and district administration to take immediate steps for peace restoration and submit daily progress reports to the Chief Minister’s Secretariat.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943037/strong-action-urged-against-child-abuse-at-seminaries-schools,"Strong action urged against child abuse at seminaries, schools - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","ISLAMABAD: The Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights on Thursday urged strong action to protect children from abuse at seminaries and schools, declaring that no child should suffer in the name of education.
The meeting, chaired by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri at Parliament House, reviewed disturbing reports of corporal punishment, torture, and sexual abuse at religious seminaries across Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtun­khwa. Officials from federal and provincial departments briefed the committee on steps taken to address the issue.
Senator Samina Zehri stressed that the state’s foremost responsibility was to protect children. She clarified that the aim was not to target legitimate religious institutions but to eliminate abuse through oversight and accountability. She expressed concern over the lack of proper registration, financial transparency, and monitoring of these institutions.
She called for strict measures, including regular inspections of madressahs, mandatory parent-teacher engagement, teacher training on child protection, and a ban on corporal punishment. She also highlighted alarmingly low conviction rates in reported cases, warning that without prosecution and deterrence, the cycle of abuse would continue unchecked.
Senate panel reviews reports of corporal punishment, torture and sexual abuse at educational institutes
Senator Aimal Wali Khan added that many madressahs had turned into revenue-generating systems instead of being integrated into the national education framework. He pushed for legislation to ensure transparency and bring seminaries under mainstream education boards.
Other members recommended district-level monitoring and harmonised provincial laws to safeguard children.
The committee also examined a case at COMSATS University involving derogatory remarks made against a student’s financial background and late father. The incident, which occurred during a class presentation in June, was said to have been reconciled later, with the instructor even gifting a laptop to the student.
Despite this, Senator Samina Zehri said such incidents highlighted deeper problems. She stressed that no student should face humiliation over financial circumstances, which could cause lasting psychological harm. She called on universities to promote compassion and respect, urging training for teachers and students in communication, tolerance, and mental health awareness.
The meeting further addressed the plight of Pakistani citizens imprisoned abroad. Briefings from the ministries of foreign affairs and interior revealed ongoing consular efforts, but admitted challenges such as lack of prisoner transfer agreements, limited resources, and gaps in documentation.
Senator Samina Zehri pressed for stronger action, demanding country-wise data, systematic tracking of cases, and transparent reporting. She urged the ministries to develop a coordinated national strategy with timelines for legal aid, consular support, and rehabilitation of returnees. A detailed action plan is to be presented at the next session.

During an assembly session chaired by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati here, Mr Ayub said lawmakers wanted to learn about what effective measures were being taken to maintain law and order in the province.
“We [lawmakers] have many questions [about the security situation] that need appropriate response as we’re unaware of the discussions held during the apex committee’s meetings,” he said.
The PTI’s chief whip said billions of rupees were spent on the fencing of the Afghan border but infiltration of terrorists continued.
He said PTI founder Imran Khan and some military generals were frequently accused of bringing terrorists totalling 1,500-2,000 back to Pakistan but why they couldn’t be eliminated.
Says lawmakers unaware of discussions held in apex committee meetings
Mr Ayub requested the chair to invite the commander of XI Corps and provincial police chief to brief the house about the law and order situation.
He said the lawmakers’ questions were required to be answered as they wanted to know how terrorists would be dealt with and terrorism eradicated as personnel of the armed forces and police along with civilians were martyred daily.
“This [terrorism] has to end. We [lawmakers] need to be informed about what effective measures are being adopted for it. Those responsible for fighting terrorism should come and brief us,” he said, adding that police were not meant to fight terrorism.
While speaking about the recent floods, the chief whip said Sindh extended help to KP during the natural calamity, while Balochistan also offered assistance, but not even a single penny was offered by Punjab.
He said that Punjab had banned flour supply to KP but received gas, electricity and patrol from KP.
Mr Ahmad wondered what would happen if KP stopped those supplies.
Earlier, opposition lawmakers criticised the provincial government for “failing” not only to protect and rehabilitate people in the flood-hit areas but also come up with plans to prevent loss of life and property in natural disasters.
PML-N lawmaker Rashad Khan said floods had affected several KP districts, with roads closed and water supply suspended.
He said people were requesting surveys of their destroyed properties for compensation.
“Relief is being given away on a political basis just like it was done during distribution of Ramazan Package,” he said, adding that all Shangla residents complain of discrimination in relief distribution.
Mr Ayub said data was being compiled, ensuring relief activities without discrimination.
“I assure you that everything will be done in a transparent manner. We’ll address every single complaint,” he said.
During the sitting, a number of women lawmakers said that people in the flood affected areas were waiting for assistance and that long-term plans were required specifically for addressing climate change and building dams in the province.
Member of the opposition JUI-F Aiman Jalil insisted the government had failed to upgrade early disaster warning systems and there’s no investment in disaster management.
She said that after two weeks, people in the flood-affected areas awaited reconstruction of the houses and restoration of businesses.
“Strategies are important to be developed to protect public life and properties in the future,” she said.
Lawmaker of the opposition PML-N Amina Sardar said the health department should take immediate steps in order to protect people from several viral infections in the flood-hit areas adding that climate change needed to be discussed seriously, particularly in KP besides construction of dams was important.
Another PML-N member, Afshan Hussain, said her party stood by the calamity-hit people.
She said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif phoned her Khyber Pakhtunkhwa counterpart, Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, and offered all-out support for the flood victims.
Mr Hussain appreciated the role of armed forces in flood rescue and relief operations.
MPA of the opposition PPP Shazia Tehmas Khan said the provincial government had formed a task force to develop the provincial capital, with no representation for women. She called for the chair’s intervention for including women members in the task force.
Lawmaker Khadija Bibi of the opposition ANP said a member from the Khudai Khidmatgaar organisation was martyred but his killers were still not traced and arrested.
She said the rate of suicide among girls in Chitral had surged, mostly due to blackmail, so the chair should depute women at police offices to deal the cases involving threats to women.
Treasury MPA Shafiullah Jan complained that the National Disaster Management Authority sent just two trucks of relief items ordering their distribution only during the visits of the prime minister and interior minister.
The chair adjourned the sitting until 2pm on Monday over a lack of quorum.

one million
children in Pakistan still missing routine vaccination, health experts on Monday gathered in Lahore for a week-long workshop focused on strengthening national immunisation efforts.
When it comes to vaccination, Pakistan continues to face challenges of low uptake, public hesitancy and mistrust, operational bottlenecks, and the unfinished struggle against the
poliovirus
.
The National Vaccinology Workshop kicked off today at Lahore’s Pearl-Continental Hotel and will run through till Friday.
The first day brought together leading experts who spoke on topics ranging from the history of vaccines and the science of how they work to global immunisation trends, coverage challenges, and Gavi’s support. Gavi is a public-private partnership formed in the year 2000 that aims to improve vaccine access in the world’s poorest countries.
Speakers on the first day included Prof Asad Ali, Dr Junaid Iqbal, Prof Farah Qamar, Dr Chaudhri Irtaza Ahmad, and Dr Richard Omore.
“What are the interventions modern medicine has done to save most lives?” Prof Ali began by asking the audience, before shortly answering himself: “Antibiotics and vaccines.”
Despite being a public health breakthrough, he noted, vaccines are costly to develop and produce because the safety threshold for administering them is set far higher than for most medicines, since they are typically given to healthy individuals.
“For years, access was largely limited to wealthy countries, until the launch of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation, through which international organisations pooled resources to support vaccine uptake worldwide,” he said.
Pakistan is currently Gavi’s
largest recipient
under its strategic phases 4.0 and 5.0, but experts warn that the country must begin preparing for life beyond donor support.
Speaking to
Dawn.com
, Dr Omore pointed to Kenya’s experience, where vaccine procurement faced transition challenges including critical vaccine stock shortages after the country crossed Gavi’s income threshold and lost support, forcing the government to quickly find its own funds.
He said Pakistan should use the current period of support to plan for a smooth transition so that immunisation programmes are not disrupted.
Dr Omore also stressed the importance of continued disease surveillance, noting that monitoring new strains and tracking vaccine impact, such as with human papillomavirus (HPV) or pneumococcal vaccines, is essential both for guiding health policy and for building public trust by showing evidence of reduced disease.
Earlier today, a poliovirus case was
reported
in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank district, taking the nationwide tally for this year to 24.
Last month, the World Health Organisation
announced
that it is partnering with the Pakistan government to train workers for the country’s first HPV vaccine drive. Experts have also
urged
advocacy for the said drive to ensure success.",2025-09-01,Yumna Khan,730,0.000115

earthquake
in Afghanistan.
The decision about aid was taken during a meeting of the provincial cabinet here on Friday with Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur in the chair.
“It is our humanitarian and moral duty to assist our Afghan brothers and sisters in this difficult time,” the chief minister said.
He said the provincial government had already sent 35 trucks with essential supplies to the affected Afghan regions.
Recognising the urgent needs on the ground, the chief minister announced further support.
Cabinet shows solidarity with Afghanistan
“Taking into account the urgent need for tents and medical supplies, we will dispatch an additional 1,000 tents and necessary medical equipment,” he said.
Mr Gandapur said the aid package also included food supplies and a commitment to offer complete care to the injured.
The cabinet meeting began with a prayer (Fateha) for those who lost their lives to the Afghan earthquake, as well as for Pakistani security personnel martyred in recent terrorist attacks across the province.
Addressing other agenda items, the chief minister also praised the timely rescue and relief operations in the flood-hit areas of the province and said financial aid was distributed to victims in record time.
CM VISITS AFGHAN CONSULATE:
Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur visited the Afghan consulate here to express condolences over the loss of lives and property to the recent earthquake in Afghanistan.
Afghan Consul General Hafiz Mohibullah Shakir warmly received the CM on arrival, according to a statement from the Chief Minister’s House.
Chief secretary Shahab Ali Shah accompanied the chief minister, who offered prayers for disaster victims and wrote remarks of condolences in the guestbook.
He said the government and people of KP stood shoulder to shoulder with their Afghan brothers and sisters in the current time of grief.
At the request of the Afghan consul general, Mr Gandapur ordered the dispatch of 1,000 more tents and medicines for the affected families.
He also said that Afghan nationals receiving medical treatment in Peshawar should be provided with all possible healthcare.
The Afghan consul general expressed gratitude to the CM and the provincial government for their timely support and assistance to the earthquake victims.
Meanwhile, Speaker of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Babar Saleem Swati on Friday visited the Afghan consulate here and extended condolences to consul general Mohibullah Shakir over the losses of human lives in the recent earthquake.
He also prayed for the deceased and their bereaved families.
“Pakistan and Afghanistan are not only neighbours but they’re bound by ties of faith, culture and brotherhood as well. The KP Assembly stands with Afghan people in this hour of grief,” he said.

earthquake
but the local courts and lawyer chambers still function in makeshift shelters to the misery of advocates and litigants.
“The provincial government approved Rs570 million funds for the judicial complex and even tendering process for it was completed earlier this year but work has yet to begin,” Balakot Tehsil Bar Association president Sardar Ashfaq told reporters on Thursday.
He said judges, lawyers and litigants continued to bear the brunt of the 2005 earthquake, as the government, despite acquiring land outside the Red Zone in 2016, had failed to commence work on the judicial complex, lawyers’ offices, and waiting sheds for litigants.
“We are about to mark the 20th anniversary of the devastating tremors next month, yet survivors remain without adequate civic services,” he said.
Work on judicial complex awaited despite funding approval, tendering
Mr Ashfaq said those courts and offices didn’t even have basic facilities like lavatories, to the suffering of judicial officers, lawyers and litigants.
The bar president said the government had earmarked Rs150 million in the current fiscal year for the groundbreaking of the judicial complex and boundary wall, but no practical steps had been taken to start the project.
“The post of civil judge has been vacant for the last five consecutive years, delaying the disposal of cases and adding to the backlog,” he said.
Mr Ashfaq said that the chief justices of the Peshawar High Court had also visited the acquired piece of land many times.
He appealed to Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur to ensure the immediate release of Rs530 million for the construction of the judicial complex and lawyers’ chambers within the stipulated period.
TOURIST SECURITY: Deputy Inspector General of Police Hazara Range Nasir Mehmood Satti on Wednesday directed police to ensure foolproof security for Pakistanis and foreigners visiting Hazara or bound for Gilgit-Baltistan.
“Hospitality is the pride and centuries-old tradition of our province. You should welcome national and foreign tourists wholeheartedly on your soil, instead of asking irrelevant questions that have nothing to do with your professional obligations,” Mr Satti said during a workshop at the Police Training School here.
Police personnel from Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Battagram, Torghar, Kolai-Palas and Upper and Lower Kohistan attended the workshop.
The DIG said Hazara was blessed with towering mountains, serene lakes and vast meadows, attracting visitors from across the country and abroad.
“We must provide foolproof security to tourists instead of handling them in an unprofessional way to discourage tourism,” he said.
On the occasion, SP Rashim Jehangir urged police personnel to recognise their professional responsibilities and avoid acts that could tarnish the department’s image.
She said if police welcomed visitors and gave them a sense of security, tourism would be enhanced.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943679/afghan-govt-spokesperson-says-leaders-shouldnt-make-provocative-statements-stresses-need-for-talks,"Afghan govt spokesperson says leaders shouldn’t make ‘provocative’ statements, stresses need for talks - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","The spokesperson for the Taliban government in Afghanistan Zabiullah Mujahid has said that leaders should refrain from making “provocative” statements and that his country could not be held responsible for attacks taking place in Pakistan.
Mujahid’s remarks come as Pakistan continues to
raise alarm
over terrorist outfits, particularly the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), using Afghan soil to carry out attacks across the border. Islamabad has repeatedly urged Kabul to choose between maintaining ties with its neighbour or harbouring
terrorists
, but Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations.
He made these remarks during an interview with Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies. According to Gul, the interview — conducted in the Pushto language — was recorded during his recent visit to Afghanistan’s Kandahar province.
During the interview, Gul sought proposals from Mujahid to address recurring problems, such as the issue of TTP or “the negative propaganda in the media that harms and poisons the relations” between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The spokesperson was also asked whether he felt the need for some sort of “joint mechanism” on such matters.
In his response, Mujahid emphasised that leaders should avoid making “provocative” statements. If statements having “threatening” undertones were issued, “we cannot stop” others, he asserted. The Taliban government spokesperson went on to say that “giving statements to the media, spoiling the environment and taking military action is unwise”.
Instead, he stressed that talks should be held. “There should be more visits, which would create trust on both sides,” Mujahid added.
He said his government was “unhappy with the current environment and propaganda that was happening presently” as it was not in the interest of either Pakistan or Afghanistan.
Mujahid also highlighted that attacks by militants and terrorists in Pakistan were not a recent occurrence. “It has been happening since 2003.”
“Then Pakistan should take steps to foil such attacks”, he said. “Islamabad should also share information with Kabul so that we can make efforts to counter these threats as well.”
But, at the same time, Mujahid added that Afghanistan could not be held responsible for bomb blasts in Bannu or any other area of Pakistan.
“Pakistan should ensure its own security,” he asserted, further recommending that Islamabad and Kabul should engage in talks to discuss the reasons behind the issue of terrorism.
“You should take us into confidence if you believe that you face threats from [an entity] in Afghanistan.”
Mujahid’s remarks follow a recent statement by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in which he
issued a stern message
to Kabul, saying that Afghanistan must decide whether it stands with Pakistan or the TTP. The premier’s statement had come after he attended the funeral of 12 soldiers in Bannu, who were
martyred
during an exchange of fire with terrorists in  South Waziristan.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks.
Gul also raised this issue during his conversation with Mujahid with respect to the strained ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“Pakistan seems to have drawn a red line as far as the TTP’s presence in Afghanistan is concerned,” Gul said, adding that this was seen as the main reason for growing tensions between the two countries. Gul asked Mujahid whether he agreed with this.
Mujahid, however, clearly stated that the TTP was Pakistan’s “internal issue”.
“Pakistan should find a solution to this problem,” he said, adding that Islamabad should not spoil its ties with Kabul over this matter.
He also assured that Afghanistan was making efforts to make sure that “no one uses its soil against any other country”.
“No armed person can go to Pakistan from Afghanistan […] The terrain in some areas is difficult, and some people may be able to take advantage of it.
“We should find a solution to this problem through negotiations and Afghanistan should not be blamed for it […] We do not want fighting, bloodshed and difficulties in Pakistan.”
Earlier in the interview, when asked what messages he and the Islamic Emirate had for those in Pakistan, he said he wanted to convey to leaders and officials that “Afghanistan wanted brotherly ties and that any issues between the two countries should be resolved through negotiations”.
“Levelling allegations and making threats spoil the environment, which further complicates matters,” he said.  The spokesperson also called for reforms in policy and urged religious scholars in Pakistan to play a role in maintaining good ties between the two countries.
Lastly, he said, he had a message for the people of Pakistan.
“My final message is for the people of Pakistan. Afghans do not want lawlessness in Pakistan. Afghanistan does not want difficulties in Pakistan […] Afghanistan wants normalisation of ties with Pakistan.”",2025-09-21,Tahir Khan,1292,0.000157

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
According to a statement from the NIH, “With this detection, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 27 – including 18 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, seven from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.”
NIH added that, “Polio Eradication conducted a Sub-National Polio Vaccination Campaign in September 2025 across 88 districts of the country including Hyderabad.”
The campaign immunised “approximately 21 million children under the age of five,” NIH said.
The next polio immunisation campaign will run from October 13 to 19 and aims to target 45.5m children.
“More than 400,000 dedicated frontline polio workers will go door-to-door to ensure that every child is reached,” NIH said.
The new case comes over a week after two fresh polio virus cases were
detected
in the south of KP. Out of the two, one of the cases was detected in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil in a 19-month-old infant, while the other case was confirmed in an 11-month-old infant in Lakki Marwat’s Suleman Khel tehsil.
In 2024, the country
reported
at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.",2025-09-22,Rukhsana Khan,465,9.5e-05

LAHORE: As the overflowing Chenab
continues
to inundate large swathes of land in the southern districts of Punjab, authorities on Tuesday said the next two days were critical for Multan and its neighbouring districts amid an “unprecedented flood emergency” that triggered
mass evacuations
.
Besides Multan, Muzaffargarh, Shujabad, Khangarh, Jalalpur Pirw­ala, Uch Sharif, and Alipur were at risk as a second major flood wave was passing through the Head Muham­madwala and Shershah bridges. However, the water level at Shershah was still half a foot below the critical threshold.
The government had decided to breach the Shershah embankment if the water level crossed its critical limit of 393.50 feet, which would affect as many as 8,000 houses and 30,000 people.
As of Tuesday, 138 mouzas in Muzaffargarh were submerged, affecting 135,000 people, in Rangpur,  28 mouzas were submerged, affective 50,000 people.
The government had also briefly closed the road connecting Multan and Muzaffargarh at Shershah Bridge. However, light vehicular traffic was resumed in the evening.
Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said water levels are rising due to a flood flow of 500,000 cusecs from Head Trimmu reaching Head Muhammadwala. In case of a high-level flood, the Sher Shah Road will be immediately breached.
Mr Sindhu said that an additional 2,000 people have been rescued from Jalalpur Pirwala in the last 24 hours. He said the floodwaters from the Sutlej and Chenab had placed Jalalpur Pirwala at high risk, so an emergency would remain in effect in Jalalpur Pirwala for the next 24 hours due to the high flood.
Multan Commissioner Aamir Kar­im Khan was monitoring rescue activities in Jalalpur Pirwala. He said that 50 villages in the area had been affected by the floods and 235,296 people besides 180,377 head of cattle had been relocated to safe locations.
In a press conference, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Kat­hia claimed the 10th monsoon spell had ended and there would be no more heavy rain in Punjab. He also said there would not be a third flood wave since the rainy season had ended.
This claim, however, was contested by an official from the Pakistan Met Department, who said the monsoon season had not ended in India and it could trigger a third wave of floods in downstream Pakistan.
He said that monsoons started early in India and the season was also longer than in Pakistan.
He said that no one could make a long-term forecast like the one made by the PDMA DG.
Meanwhile, the Met department also forecast widespread rain, windstorms and thundershowers in southern Balochistan and lower Sindh on Wednesday, with scattered heavy to very heavy falls likely in parts of south Balochistan.
The claims by the PDMA chief came as the Sutlej River flowed in high flood due to water released by India from its dams.
According to him, 253,000 cusecs had passed at Ganda Singh Wala and 11 feet of water at Indian Dam Thein receded. He said that the water near Kasur also decreased from 311,000 to 253,000 cusecs and the river flow would be normal in a day or two.
He said that upper Punjab villages would be normalised in a day or two, adding that 300,000 cusecs of water at Trimmu Barrage had started receding and 300,000 cusecs was crossing Head Panjnad. According to the official, a surge of 400,000 cusecs was approaching Guddu Barrage, which would release pressure in areas of southern Punjab.
Mr Kathia said that 80,000 people are currently residing in 488 relief camps, adding that over 2.1 million people had been evacuated to safer locations. Likewise, 1.95 million acres of agricultural land in Punjab had been flooded, he added.
The PDMA DG said that in the last 24 hours, a girl died due to a roof collapse caused by rain. He did not mention the place of the incident.
Three killed in Karachi
Due to
widespread rain
, two teenagers died from electrocution and ano­ther drowned in Karachi.
The Met office said the deep depression that had been causing rains in Karachi and Sindh would gradually move towards Balochistan and turn into a well-marked low-pressure area.
Several hundred straw-mud houses in the rural areas of Tharparkar and Dadu districts were swept away as the two districts had been receiving intermittent heavy, moderate and light spells of monsoon rains for the last six and four days, respectively.
River flows
As of 11:30pm on Tuesday, PDMA reported that on the  Chenab River, the flow is steady at 69,300 cusecs at Marala Headworks,  with Khanki Headworks at 97,898 cusecs and Qadirabad Headworks at 98,316  cusecs, both also steady.
The Chiniot Bridge was reporting a steady  flow of 79,914 cusecs, while the Rivaz Bridge gauge was at 519.10 feet,  which was falling. At Trimmu Head­works, the flow was steady at 339,292  cusecs, with the Head Muhammadwala gauge at 413.70 feet against a level  of 417.50 feet and steady. The Shershah Bridge was at 393.40 feet  against 393.50 feet and was steady.

$5m from UN
United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher has announced a $5 million allocation from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support the government-led flood response in Pakistan.
The funds will enable UN agencies and partners to deliver immediate life-saving assistance to some of the four million people who have been affected by flooding so far, including more than 2 million who were forced out of their homes in search for higher ground.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari directed the Ministry of National Food Security to take urgent measures to ensure food security in the country in the wake of the recent flood devastation.

suicide bombing
near Shahwani Stadium in Quetta’s Sariab the previous night rose to 15 on Wednesday.
The attack occurred shortly after the conclusion of a public meeting of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal) held to mark the death anniversary of the late Sardar Attaullah Mengal. The banned militant Islamic State group claimed responsibility today for the attack,
AFP
reported.
Addressing a press conference today, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Muhammad Hamza Shafqaat said that the suicide attack claimed 15 lives and injured 32 others.
He said the explosion occurred approximately 500 metres from the exit point of the rally, adding that the rally had officially concluded hours earlier, with the blast taking place at 9:45pm in a poorly lit area near a graveyard.
Shafqaat said that the attacker was unable to breach the main gathering due to stringent security measures, including the deployment of 120 police personnel.
He added that this forced the assailant to detonate the device away from the crowd. “The remains of the bomber, believed to be under 30 years old, were recovered, and authorities estimate that around eight kilogrammes of explosives were used,” he said.
Shaqaat said that the chief minister had announced a compensation package of Rs1.5 million for families of the deceased, Rs0.5m for each injured individual and Rs 200,000 in support for minor victims.
He said Section 144 has been enforced across Balochistan till September 15 and a province-wide high alert remains in effect, adding that authorities have also prohibited public gatherings and processions after sundown, especially during Eid Miladun Nabi, to ensure public safety.
Shafqaat urged the public to trust law enforcement agencies, follow security protocols and report any suspicious activity.
CM Bugti orders swift action against perpetrators, calls for unity
Separately, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice, declaring that terrorists would not be allowed to destabilise the province’s peace.
The chief minister expressed these remarks during a high-level meeting on law and order convened in the wake of the attack.
During the meeting, Shafqaat and Acting Inspector General of Police Saeed Wazir presented a detailed briefing on the incident. CM Bugti emphasised the need to strengthen security protocols and assured that there would be zero tolerance for lapses in public protection.
He directed Shafqaat to keep both the public and media informed with verified updates to counter misinformation.
“The terrorists behind the Shahwani Stadium blast will be brought to their logical conclusion and held accountable under the law,” Bugti added, reaffirming the government’s solidarity with the victims’ families.
He said that critically injured individuals would be transferred to Karachi via government air services if necessary to ensure optimal medical care.
The chief minister urged political parties and citizens to cooperate with law enforcement agencies during the current threat alert.
“This is a time for unity and collective resolve to defeat those who seek to spread fear,” he said.
In preparation for upcoming religious events, Bugti instructed officials to devise a comprehensive security plan for Eid Miladun Nabi processions. He appealed to the public to support authorities in maintaining peace during these gatherings.
He also visited Civil Hospital’s Trauma Centre and Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta to enquire about the health of blast victims.
Health department officials briefed the chief minister on the medical facilities provided to the injured.
The chief minister met the injured and their heirs and asked about the quality of treatment.
Expressing his satisfaction over the steps taken for the treatment and care of the injured, he said that all possible medical facilities were being provided to the injured.
CM Bugti said that terrorists were showing cowardice by targeting innocent citizens and they would not succeed in their design to sabotage the peace of the province.
President, PM Shehbaz condemn blast
President Asif Ali Zardari vehemently condemned the blast, said a statement from the Presidency, adding he directed the relevant institutions to launch a comprehensive investigation into the incident and ensure that the perpetrators were brought to justice.
The president expressed his profound grief and solidarity with the families of those who lost their lives in the attack, offering his condolences. He also prayed for the swift recovery of the injured and issued directives to concerned officials to provide them with the best possible medical treatment.
In a separate statement issued from the Prime Minister’s Office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who is currently on an official visit to Beijing, also condemned the attack in the strongest terms. The premier expressed his deep sorrow and anguish over the loss of lives.
PM Shehbaz characterised the assault on the political rally as “damning evidence of the nefarious conspiracy by terrorists to spread chaos in Balochistan”. He asserted that “terrorists are the enemies of peace and development in Balochistan.”
He further declared, “We will continue the war against terrorism until the complete eradication of this menace.”
PM Shehbaz stated that attacks on innocent and unarmed citizens were “cowardly and condemnable”. The prime minister also instructed authorities to provide the best medical facilities to the wounded and to ensure the swift identification and prosecution of those involved in the bombing.
He also spoke with CM Bugti to extend his condolences.
“The terrorists involved in the blast will be traced and given exemplary punishment,” the prime minister said. “Terrorists are enemies of peace and development in Balochistan.“",2025-09-03,APP,1456,0.000169

The agency aims to change the country’s disaster response from reactive to proactive, said Sup­arco’s member for tech­no­logy Zafar Iqbal at the la­­unch of the ‘Space-based Disaster Manage­ment — Shifting Focus from Rea­c­tive to Proactive Approa­c­hes’ training in Islamabad.
“These tools are used to enhance early warning sys­tems and support nati­onal policies and authorities on disaster preparedness as mitigation and ad­­aptation advance together as twin priorities,” Mr Iqbal said.
He stressed the importance of readiness before a crisis occurs.
“The challenge before us is not only to respond to disasters after they occur, but more importantly, to strengthen preparedness and resilience before they strike,” Mr Iqbal said.
“By harnessing satellite data, remote sensing, and geospatial tools, we can mo­­nitor risks in advance, identify vulnerable areas, and support decision-makers with timely, actionable information.” He added that such strategies save lives, protect infrastructure and ensure that scarce resou­rces are deployed more effectively.

• Criticises civic body for ‘not resolving’ city’s problems, says ‘N-PPP’ alliance to continue at federal level
• Calls on JI to discuss no-confidence motion against mayor
• Move unlikely to threaten Murtaza Wahab’s position as numbers still in his favour
KARACHI: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Friday formally announced its decision to withdraw support from the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP)-led local government set-up and Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, citing his ‘poor’ performance, unfulfilled commitments and their exclusion from key administrative processes as the reason for the critical move.
Speaking at a press conference, PML-N parliamentary party leader in the City Council Feroz Khan strongly criticised the PPP for what he described as a “complete betrayal of promises” made prior to the mayoral election.
With 14 members in the City Council, the PML-N leader lamented that despite voting in favour of the PPP candidate for mayor — a decision influenced by their alliance at the Centre — the party was sidelined in key decisions and governance matters in Karachi. “There was a clear understanding between our leaderships, but that agreement was never honoured once Murtaza Wahab assumed the office,” he claimed.
Mr Khan clarified that while the PML-N remained in alliance with the PPP at the federal level, the situation in Karachi had reached a “tipping point”. “The dynamics in the Centre are different, but locally, the party cannot be part of a government that ignores our mandate, excludes us from governance, and fails to deliver on public issues.”
He added that the party’s decision to move to the opposition benches in the City Council was made after consultations with senior party leadership.
Hours after the press conference, Mr Khan along with other party members of the City Council reached out to the Jamaat-i-Islami, signalling a political realignment in the City Council.
A PML-N delegation visited the office of the JI’s Idara Noor-i-Haq and met City Council Opposition Leader Advocate Saifuddin. The two sides discussed various options, including the possibility of a no-confidence move against Mayor Wahab.
With 130 members, the JI is the second largest group in the City Council. However, a potential alliance between the PML-N and JI would unlikely threaten Mayor Wahab’s position, as he holds a simple majority in the City Council with support from over two dozen PTI dissidents, in addition to his party’s 155 members and some others.
At the press conference, the PML-N leader strongly criticised the mayor and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) for what he termed their “abysmal” performance in resolving the city’s civic problems.
He pointed to mounting piles of garbage across major neighbourhoods, calling them a clear sign of neglect and administrative failure by the city authorities.
“The people of Karachi are being forced to live in unacceptable conditions while the KMC continues to make hollow claims,” he said, demanding immediate action and accountability from the city’s leadership.
“When the PPP needed our support to elect Murtaza Wahab as mayor, they promised the moon. But after securing the seat, they forgot every commitment made to us. This is not just political opportunism it is a breach of trust.”
He said that the PML-N had high hopes that the alliance would deliver on promises to address Karachi’s pressing problems, but instead, the PPP’s city administration reduced itself to “photo sessions and press statements” with no tangible improvement on the ground.
“Mian Nawaz Sharif’s vision was to restore Karachi as the city of lights, a city that drives Pakistan’s economy and represents its diversity. Unfortunately, that vision is not being respected by those currently in charge of the city,” he added.
“We took this step after months of patience and repeated attempts to get our concerns addressed. This is not a hasty decision; it is a necessary one for the people of Karachi and for the credibility of our party,” he added.
The PML-N leader emphasised that the party would now play the role of a “constructive opposition” in the City Council.
“We will not obstruct for the sake of opposition. Our goal is to ensure that the people of Karachi are served. We will raise every public issue and hold the city administration accountable,” he added.

Also, two terrorists were killed in a fierce clash with police in Bannu district.
Residents of Maidan told
Dawn
that three gunship helicopters resorted to heavy shelling on terrorist hideouts in Sar Banda, Mulayano Banda and Abdullah Banda areas.
They said the shelling lasted around one and a half hours before copters left the area.
Officials said the operation was launched over reports of increased terrorist presence and movement in the area.
Bannu police kill two terrorists in clash
Details of damage caused to terrorists could not be ascertained.
Residents insisted that a child, who had gone to a nearby hill, was slightly injured in the shelling. He was shifted to the THQ hospital in Lal Qila.
They said security forces had taken positions in government schools in Atto and Mulayano Banda areas. The schools were vacated a few days ago.
The residents said terrorists were recently spotted in Mond Ghar, Kas Ghurgi, Mishwano and Sar Banda areas.
On Sept 11, seven Frontier Corps personnel were
martyred
and 13 injured in a clash with terrorists in Sar Banda area of Maidan.
Maidan was once a stronghold of the proscribed Tehreek Nifaz-i-Shariat Mohammadi led by Maulana Sufi Mohammad.
In 2008, terrorists took control of most Maidan parts and set up parallel courts. However, a military operation in April 2009 forced most TTP fighters to flee to Afghanistan and take shelter in Kunar province. The operation displaced around 300,000 residents, who lived either in camps or with relatives in other parts of the province.
Also, two terrorists were killed in a fierce clash with police in Dil Mamashkhel area of Bannu district late on Thursday.
A police official told
Dawn
that the clash took place within the limits of the cantonment police station when a police team assisted by commandos of the counterterrorism department reached the rural area on the information about the presence of terrorists.
He said the terrorists, who were planting an improvised explosive device on the roadside, opened fire on the policemen.
“In retaliatory fire, law enforcers killed two terrorists. However, the others fled, taking advantage of thick and dense bushes and populated areas,” he said.
Meanwhile, elders from rural areas in Lakki Marwat district on Friday vowed to check crimes and anti-peace activities.
During a jirga in the Masha Mansdoor area on Friday, they said the people involved in robberies and anti-peace activities won’t be spared.
The participants included elders and villagers from Titterkhel, Omar Titterkhel, Tabi Murad, Ghazikhel, Zer Mallahkhel, Samandar Titterkhel, Sharbikhel, Qutabkhel, Badnikhel, Jhangkhel, Zangikhel, Mandrakhel and Mash Mansoor.
An elder complained that robberies were reported in rural areas of the district after the start of winter.
He said highways and roads in urban and rural areas had become unsafe due to the presence of “anti-state elements.”
The other participants said they would soon start pruning trees on both sides of the link road from Umar Adda to Mandrakhel via Masha Mansoor to check criminal and terrorist activities.
“In case a robbery occurs on a village road, the Chagha Party (armed villagers) will chase outlaws until they’re captured,” an elder said.
He said if any member of the Chagha Party was killed or injured by terrorists or criminals, elders of all rural areas would jointly compensate the victim’s family.
The elders asked youths to guard their villages and hamlets during the nighttime.

However, the video is old and does not show the Houthi official talking about Pakistan.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh on Sept 16, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
A statement from the PM’s office announcing the signing of the pact read: “This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression.”
A known Indian propaganda account
shared
the picture of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman on X today, along with a video clip of a Houthi official.
The caption of the post said: “Breaking: Tensions escalate after Pakistan sends 25,000 troops to the Saudi–Yemen border under a new defence pact. Houthi fighters issued a stark threat, saying they will ‘turn the Yemen–Saudi border into a graveyard for Pakistani soldiers’, raising fears of wider confrontation.”
The video attached to the post did not have any subtitles or a translation of what the person was saying. It also did not mention the identity of the person in the video clip.
The post gained over 359,000 views.
The video with the same claim was shared by multiple other users on X as can be seen
here
,

and
here
.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the defence agreement signed between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
A keyword search to corroborate the alleged developments yielded no news reports from credible mainstream international, Saudi, Yemeni or domestic media outlets about either Pakistan sending 25,000 troops to the Saudi-Yemen border or the Houthis threatening Pakistan for any such move.
To corroborate what was actually being said in the video, its content was translated into English through AI transcription tool Turboscribe, which
showed
that the Houthi official did not say anything about threatening Pakistan.
Translating the video through ChatGPT and Google Translate also yielded the following transcription:
“For us, Gaza is a red line — a red line. Our causes, our sanctities, and our Islam are a red line, and we do not compromise on them. In his last speech, Sayyid [the leader] said: There are no red lines in front of the Yemeni people. No red lines. If you have red lines, we have none in front of us. We will target things the enemy has never thought of, never imagined, and not even the Yemeni people or the peoples of the [Muslim] nation have imagined. And we will reach, by God’s permission and with His power, the fifth and sixth stages. If the enemy’s aggression continues against Gaza, there will be positions and actions that not even the Yemeni spirit could have imagined.”
A reverse image search yielded a video report by Lebanon-based news outlet
Al Mayadeen News
on its YouTube channel on May 14, 2024.
Comparing the viral clip with the original video showed that they were the same, as can be seen by the writing in the background, the speaker’s hand gestures and his facial features.
The
translation
of the news clip is provided below:
Anchor: “From the Yemeni support front, Yemeni Armed Forces spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree confirmed that Gaza is a red line and that operations are open with no red lines. He also stressed that if the aggression against Gaza continues, the armed forces will strike targets that the enemies cannot imagine.”
Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree: “If Gaza is a red line, then our causes, our sanctities, and our Islam are red lines, and we will not compromise on them. I heard Mr Al-Shammari say in the last test that there are no red lines for the Yemeni people, no red lines. If you have red lines for us, they are not red lines. We will target things that the enemy has not thought of, that the enemy cannot imagine, that even the Yemeni people and the peoples of the nation cannot imagine. And we will reach the fifth and sixth stages, God willing and with God’s power, if the enemy continues its aggression against Gaza. This means that there will be situations that even the Yemeni people cannot imagine, and that even the Americans cannot imagine.”
The
Al Mayadeen News
report mentions the person speaking as Yemeni Armed Forces’ spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree. The translated transcription shows that he did not mention Pakistan in his statements.
A keyword search for further information on the video yielded a
news article
published by Iranian news outlet
Press TV
on May 14, 2024, titled “Yemen warns it may strike targets enemy ‘can’t even imagine’”.
According to the report, Saree warned that Yemen’s armed forces might escalate their pro-Palestinian strikes if Israel kept up its “ongoing genocidal war” against the Gaza Strip.
The articles quoted Saree as saying: “Gaza is a red line for us, a red line. Our causes, holy sites and our Islam are red lines, and we will not compromise on them. We target things that the enemy hasn’t thought of and can’t imagine, things that neither the Yemeni people nor the people of the [Arab and Islamic] nation can imagine.”
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video clip shows a Houthi official threatening Pakistan after the signing of a mutual defence deal with Saudi Arabia is
false
. The video is old from May 2024 and shows Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree talking about Israel and the Gaza conflict.

The chief minister, speaking to the media in Kashmore, also mentioned PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s requests to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with regard to the ongoing relief works.
He thanked the prime minister for declaring a climate and agricultural emergency as was requested by the party chairman.
“However, two other requests from Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari — to provide aid to flood victims through the Benazir Income Support Progra­mme (BISP) and to make a flash appeal to UN — have not yet been responded to,” he regretted.
‘Situation at all embankments satisfactory’
Mr Shah observed that currently there was a high flood at Guddu Barrage but Sindh was prepared to face a peak of up to 650,000 cusecs.
He praised Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro and his team for tirelessly working to save people’s life and property and also commended cabinet ministers, lawmakers and divisional / district administrations for their great efforts.
“The situation of all the embankments is satisfactory,” he observed, and praised the courage of the people living in the riverine areas, “who are bravely facing this challenge without any panic”.
He also thanked the army, navy, PDM and Rescue 1122 for their support.
Floodwater receding
CM Shah also noted that water levels at Punjnad and rivers in Punjab were coming down, and pointed out that September is the last month of monsoon season.
He estimated that it will take the floodwater 10 to 12 days to reach Kotri Barrage.
“All our ministers and administrations are present throughout Sindh; from Kashmore to Keti Bunder, all are active,” he said.
The chief minister said that the Indus River has its own flows. “We have raised the KK Bund by five feet. The river changes its course every year. When we strengthen one vulnerable point, it creates a new one elsewhere; Our efforts are continuous and will remain so,” he said.
During his inspection of the Sukkur Barrage, the CM was accompanying provincial ministers, Sindh government spokesman Arsalan Shaikh, District Council Chairman Syed Kumail Hyder Shah and barrage officials.
During a briefing at the barrage office, the irrigation secretary and chief engineer informed him that the high flood at Guddu and Sukkur barrages was expected to persist until tomorrow (Sept 15) after which it would start to subsiding.
The CM visited the Ali Wahan Bund at Zero Point in Sukkur and also inspected the relief, medical and livestock camps established there.
Kumail Shah briefed him about the rescue operations, ferry boat services and other measures taken by the district administration.
He said that the ferry service boats were continuously participating in rescue operations.

Two among the three militants killed during the IBO, were involved in a suicide bombing in Peshawar which led to the deaths of a sub-inspector and a constable.
A statement issued by the CTD said that the department conducted an IBO based on the reported presence of Fazal Noor, a commander of the banned militant Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) and his group members in Ali Masjid area of the district.
It added that as soon as the SWAT reached the spot, the militants opened fire which was retaliated and the exchange of fire continued for around 30 minutes.
The CTD said a search operation was launched after the firing stopped  and the SWAT team found three dead bodies who were later identified as Muhammad Naeem, Muhammad Karim, residents of Karak, and Noor Nabi, a resident of Nangarhar in Afghanistan, affiliated with the ISKP.
It added that Fazal Noor along with other group members escaped during the exchange of fire.
“The militant group had been under continuous technical surveillance, with investigators tracing their movements and confirming their identity through technical footprints,” the statement read, adding that the CTD traced their movement for the execution of a militant activity in the Lala Chena Dosarky Ali Masjid in Khyber district.
The statement said the SWAT team recovered three SMGs, 135 rounds, 12 magazines and three bundle wear, adding that the technical investigation linked the group to at least three militant attacks.
“Preliminary intelligence confirms that two militants who fled away from the scene were identified as a local commander of ISKP namely Fazal Noor and Hakim Nisar operating under foreign-based, foreign-funded handlers with active plans to conduct major terrorist activities in Peshawar and Khyber,” the statement read.",2025-09-20,Umer Farooq,500,9.7e-05

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943994/fir-registration-delays-refusals-cant-be-justified-rules-sc,"FIR registration delays, refusals can’t be justified, rules SC - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","KARACHI: Noting widespread and systematic refusals or delays in the registration of first information reports (FIRs), the Supreme Court has ruled that no reason can justify the dereliction of the mandatory statutory duty of the police, as violations would erode public trust in the criminal justice system.
A three-judge bench of the apex court, comprising Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Salahuddin Panhwar, also noted that the registration of an FIR under Section 154 of the criminal procedure
code
(CrPC) was exclusively an executive function and violation of the statutory duty has profound consequences for the parties involved in a criminal case.
“A dysfunctional criminal justice system for citizens who are not privileged or powerful manifests lack of constitutional governance. The onus is on the respective governments to establish that every citizen is dealt with in accordance with the obligation enshrined under Article 4 of the
Constitution
,” it added.
The bench made these observations while deciding a criminal appeal filed by two murder convicts, impugning a judgement of the Sindh High Court.
Denial of FIRs erodes trust in justice system, notes Justice Minallah
Authored by Justice Minallah, the SC verdict said that a functional and effective criminal justice system was premised on the foundation of fairness, integrity and impartiality of FIRs about the commission of a cognizable offence under Section 154 of CrPC and pursuing investigation.
It also noted that these two executive functions were so crucial that they ultimately determine whether justice would be served and whether the actual perpetrator will be held accountable, or rather making an innocent person suffer the unimaginable agony of carrying the stigma of being an accused.
“The bedrock of constitutional governance and rule of law is profoundly undermined when there is dereliction of the two aforementioned statutory duties vested exclusively in the executive branch of the State. It is an onerous duty of the State and its functionaries to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens by protecting them from being victims of crime and if a crime takes place, then to hold the perpetrator accountable,” it added.
The bench further observed that various factors may contribute to the failure or refusal by a police station in-charge to register a criminal FIR for a cognisable offence. These may include attempts to avoid adding to an already heavy workload, concealing the deterioration of law and order, inability to prevent crime, or even corruption and misuse of statutory powers to benefit, or act at the behest of, politically or socially influential individuals or groups in the area, it said.
However, the bench emphasised that no reason can justify the dereliction of the mandatory statutory duty imposed under Section 154 of the CrPC. “A violation of this duty not only undermines the fundamental rights of citizens but also severely erodes public trust in the criminal justice system.”
“A citizen would be justified in perceiving that the criminal justice system merely serves the interests of the privileged and those who wield political and social power. The phenomenon also gives rise to the perception that the registration of a criminal case is subject to seeking permission from the superior officials or the politically or socially powerful persons of the area. If so, then it erodes the rule of law and amounts to a grave violation of a mandatory statutory duty,” it added.
The apex court also stated that it was an onerous task of each provincial government to dispel such perception by ensuring that in each case there must be no dereliction of the statutory duty imposed under section 154 of CrPC and in case of violation, to take such appropriate action which creates deterrence for the future.
About the systemic phenomenon of refusal or delay in registration of FIR, the bench further observed that this phenomenon appeared to be widespread because it has been persistently observed in most of the criminal cases and it has also been witnessed that this phenomenon was generally prevalent in cases relating to vulnerable and marginalised classes.
The bench directed its office to send copies of this judgement to the secretary of the ministry of interior and chief secretaries of the respective provinces for placing the same before the competent forums for consideration of these observations and taking effective measures regarding the mandatory statutory duties highlighted in the judgment.
It also acquitted both the appellants by overturning the orders of the SHC as well as the trial court.
A sessions court in Shikarpur had sentenced Mir Muhammad alias Kuraro and Allah Wadhayo to death for killing a man named Ghulam Qadir in May 2013. In 2021, the SHC had converted the capital punishment into life term and the convicts had challenged the same before the apex court.

The initial medical examination of the victim confirmed the offence, the police said.
Khalabat Township police quoted the victim, 21, as saying that her husband was abroad and she was living in a rented house in the New Abadi Sector 3, Khalabat Township, on a valid Pakistani visa.
On Thursday evening, she said that she was on way to Afghan camp No 16 on foot to see some of her relatives when a young man overpowered her and dragged her into the fields, where he, who introduced himself as Bacha, forcibly raped her.
“I was preparing to leave when four accomplices of the man reached there and sexually assaulted me one after the other”, SHO Khalabat Inspector Sidiq Shah quoted the victim as saying.
He told
Dawn
that one of the alleged rapists also slapped and punched her in the face when she attempted to put up resistance.
The victim identified the five rapists who all were reportedly Afghan refugees namely Nadi, Rozi, Khan Sher, Javed and Naseer.
“The initial medical report conducted at the Trauma Centre Haripur has established the offence of rape while the detailed Forensic analysis report would be received from FSL later,” said SHO Sidiq Shah, adding that the accused have been arrested and a case under section 375-A of the PPC was registered against them.
According to the SHO the accused would be produced before the court of area magistrate for physical remand on Saturday.
DENGUE CONTROL: Intensified efforts under a multi-pronged strategy of the district administration have helped in bringing under control the transmission of the viral dengue disease with zero death across the district.
This was claimed by the deputy commissioner, Waseem Ahmed, the other day while briefing journalists about the dengue fever and the measures that the administration and health department have jointly taken to protect the residents of Haripur from the disease.
He said that in line with the directives from the provincial government, active engagement of all the line departments, private educational institutions, social activists and local community was ensured and the communities especially in hotspot areas were educated about the protection measures against the mosquito bite during daily community sessions.
“Daily surveillance of hotspot areas, identification of mosquito breeding spots, targeted home sprays helped us to control the transmission of dengue as compare to the year 2022 which was the worst of its kind in terms of dengue fever transmission”, he informed the media.
He said that under the supervision of assistant commissioners of all tehsils and the district entomologists, the staff of DHO office, TMAs concerned and line departments conduct daily visits to the nurseries, block factories, tyre shops, open water containers and houses of hotspot areas.

Mr Abbasi told a news conference here that the report also called for new rules of engagement for state institutions, including the military, to end political manipulation and ensure independence of democratic institutions.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has already
urged
the foreign observers mission to release its report about the Feb 8, 2024 elections in Pakistan, following
claims
by the independent news outlet
Drop Site News
that the COG had “buried” the report after finding the general elections to be riddled with problems.
Mr Abbasi insisted that according to the leaked COG report, the Official Secret Act was changed after May 9 and that, too, retrospectively to validate the “illegal act of civilian trial in military courts as well as the trial of PTI founder Imran Khan in the cypher case”.
Abbasi claims leaked report also calls for independent judiciary in Pakistan
He said the report also noted that people were picked up, houses were raided, PTI offices were closed, basic human rights were violated and PTI was not provided with a level-playing field during the Feb 8 polls, with fundraising being blocked and political gatherings banned.
“Imran Khan was sentenced multiple times to keep him out of the elections and the law was used as an organised weapon,” he quoted the COG report as claiming.
The aide to the CM said the report also raised questions about the lifting of a life ban on former prime minister Nawaz Sharif from parliament due to his disqualification by courts as well as the denial of the election symbol to the PTI.
He added that the COG report observed that Pemra laws were changed to victimise individuals, while journalists were murdered but no efforts were made to bring the accused to task.
“Internet was shut down on the election day and when the Election Commission of Pakistan was asked about it, it insisted that the matter was beyond its authority,” he quoted the report as noting.
Mr Abbasi also said the report declared the objective of the internet blackout to be the manipulation of election results by changing the relevant Forms 45, 46 and 47.
He said the COG report pointed out that the forms provided to the polling agents about election results were different from those uploaded on the ECP’s website and that the Election Act was changed to appoint retired judges and reverse the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“All this was done to keep one political party out of elections, so their credibility and transparency was zero,” the adviser quoted the report as declaring.
He said that according to the COG report, the “security system” had always been given priority over democratic institutions in Pakistan.
Mr Abbasi also said the anti-corruption establishment launched inquiries into the “misconduct” of presiding officers that were later dismissed by ECP, while the presiding officer was accused of forging Form-45 in the provincial assembly constituencies 79 and 82, with the act later confirmed by two presiding officers.
“The statements were recorded and the misconduct was established afterward. Under the law, that crime has to be punished,” he said.
The aide to the CM said that the law allowed the ACE to carry out inquiries.
He insisted that legal proceedings couldn’t be set aside on administrative orders and that the law department would deliberate the matter.

A team of 40 investigators from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has started scouring Instagram, TikTok and YouTube posts this week, to match influencers, celebrities, realtors and businesspeople with disproportionate filings.
“It’s open-source their Instagram accounts are a public declaration,” one senior FBR official said, adding that tax evasion cases can be opened up in a matter of hours.
The FBR did not respond to a
Reuters
request for comment.
The monitoring cell has been formed to address the country’s chronic inability to meet revenue collection targets, and to help meet tougher goals set in this year’s International Monetary Fund-backed
budget
.
Pakistan has one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in Asia, a chronic weakness that has forced the country into nearly two dozen IMF programmes. Less than two per cent of the population pays its income tax.
The unit was formally set up this month, according to an internal document seen by
Reuters
, which said its mandate was to “systematically monitor, scour and analyse data from major social media platforms” and identify people who display wealth but are either not registered for tax or declare income that appears incongruous with their expenditures and assets.
According to the document, the cell will build digital profiles of suspects, assess the money behind their lifestyles, and prepare reports that can be used for tax or money laundering investigations.
It will maintain a central database of evidence, including screenshots and timestamps, the document said.
Diamonds, drones, DJs, and databases
Officials said one wedding under review carried a price tag of nearly Rs248 million ($878,000).
Documents seen by
Reuters
showed nearly $283,000 spent on diamond and gold sets and $124,000 on bridal outfits by leading South Asian designers.
Guests entered through a hallway of floral arches as drones lit up the sky, before sitting down to multi-course meals prepared for 400 people.
The celebrations featured top makeup artists, DJs and traditional qawwali music bands, while international consultants helped choreograph the six-day affair that officials said epitomised the kind of extravagant spending now in their crosshairs.
The wedding is just one of several cases under review, officials said.
Investigators are also examining videos of luxury cars, high-end property tours and influencers flaunting expensive lifestyles.
“People themselves tag the event managers, the caterers, the jewellers, etc. It makes our work easy,” another official said, adding that the expenditure of the two families involved did not match their income declaration.
Despite its recent formation, the new unit has already shortlisted multiple files for deeper scrutiny, officials said.

Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia
entered
into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday. On Thursday, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif
stated
in an interview that the pact was defensive in nature.
During a weekly press briefing today, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan called the agreement “an important milestone for promoting peace and security in the region and the world” and noted that since the 1960s, a key pillar of the ties between Islamabad and Riyadh has been defence cooperation.
“The Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement formalises this decades-old and robust defence partnership,” the spokesperson said. “It is defensive in nature and not directed against any third country. It will contribute to regional peace, security and stability.”
Khan added that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received a telephone call from the Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty on Thursday night, congratulating him on the landmark agreement.
“The strategic defence agreement is a milestone in promoting partnership and trust,” the spokesperson said, quoting the Egyptian FM. “Both foreign ministers discussed regional and global issues and emphasised the importance of peace, stability and economic development.”
According to the spokesperson, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia enjoy a “long and distinguished history of brotherhood and cooperation”.

mutual defence agreement
during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to Riyadh, the premier on Thursday expressed gratitude for the “heart-warming welcome” given to him in the Gulf State and shared that his talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman covered regional challenges, as well as enhancing bilateral cooperation.
PM Shehbaz reached Riyadh for a day-long visit yesterday where he and Crown Prince Salman signed the ’Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ at the Al-Yamamah Palace in the Saudi capital.
“Deeply touched by the heart warming welcome, accorded to me by my dear brother HRH (His Royal Highness) Prince Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince and prime minister of Saudi Arabia, on my official visit to Riyadh.
“From the unprecedented escort provided to my aircraft by the Royal Saudi air force jets to the smartly turned out guard of the Saudi armed forces, this welcome reception speaks volumes about the abiding love and mutual respect between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” he said in a post on X.
The premier shared that his “most cordial talks” with the crown prince covered a wide range of issues, reviewing regional challenges and enhancing bilateral cooperation“.
“I deeply admire HRH’s vision and leadership that he provides to the Muslim world,” he said, adding that on the bilateral front, he “greatly values” the Saudi crown prince’s “consistent support and his keen interest” in expanding Saudi investments, trade and business ties between Islamabad and Riyadh.
“It is my fervent prayer that Pakistan [and] Saudi Arabia’s friendship continues to flourish and attain new heights of glory. Inshallah! (God willing),” PM Shehbaz said.
PM Shehbaz left for London today after concluding his visit to Riyadh.
Defence agreement
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed
economic assistance
and
energy supplies
, with Riyadh being a significant
source of financial aid and oil
for Islamabad.
Wednesday’s agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades.
The announcement was made in a joint statement by Islamabad and Riyadh. The statement said the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”.
“[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details.
Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an
Arab summit
that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of
Israel’s attack
on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries.
Official Saudi media outlets also carried reports of the signing ceremony, but they offered no further details about the accord or its provisions.
Cooperation between the two states in the area of defence dates back to 1967 and deepened after the
1979 Grand Mosque seizure
, when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram.
In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms.
Currently the number of Pakistani soldiers deployed in the kingdom is estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 troops, providing operational, technical and training help to the Saudi military, according to a
Reuters
report. That includes assistance to the Saudi air and land forces, the report said.
In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In February, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges.
The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella though finer details of the agreement were not made public.
For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider.
For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time.
Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded.
Today, Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkey and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses.
Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represents Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.
Question of nuclear weapons
Asked whether Pakistan would now be obliged to provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella, a senior Saudi official told
Reuters
: “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means.”
The agreement was the culmination of years of discussions, the Saudi official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said when asked about the timing of the deal. “This is not a response to specific countries or specific events but an institutionalisation of long-standing and deep cooperation between our two countries,” the official added.
Pakistan has previously maintained that its nuclear weapons are only aimed, as a deterrent, against India, and its missiles are designed with a range to hit anywhere to its east in India.
The senior Saudi official acknowledged the need to balance relations with Pakistan and India, also a nuclear power.
“Our relationship with India is more robust than it has ever been. We will continue to grow this relationship and seek to contribute to regional peace whichever way we can.”

• Minister Musadik Malik assures CM Murad of federal government’s support in improving Sukkur Barrage’s capacity
KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Dr Musadik Malik on Monday agreed to develop a 300-day Climate Action Plan to prepare for the next year’s monsoon.
According to a press release issued by the CM House, the meeting also decided to modernise the weather forecasting system, ensuring timely alerts and preparedness.
Both Mr Shah and Dr Malik agreed to constitute a ‘working group’ under Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah to prepare the action plan within two weeks.
The meeting, held at CM House on Monday, was attended by Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah and Principal Secretary Agha Wasif.
The meeting noted that the next monsoon season is expected to begin 15 days earlier than usual.
Against this backdrop, all four provincial governments will present their proposals, including necessary projects, under this plan. It was noted that proactive measures could significantly reduce damages caused by heavy rains and riverine floods.
Both sides acknowledged that Pakistan is facing severe losses due to climate change and emphasised the need for global support to minimise the damage.
The meeting also agreed on strengthening the carbon credit market. “The federal government will fully support provinces in opening the carbon credit market,” said Dr Malik.
The CM said that the provincial government had already initiated carbon credit marketing and stressed the need to expand it further.
Plan to improve capacity of Sukkur Barrage
The meeting also discussed improving Sukkur Barrage capacity, reinforcing fragile embankments of the Indus, and restoring old waterways to prevent loss of lives and property during riverine and flash floods.
The CM pointed out that this year’s challenges were compounded by riverine floods.
Highlighting the situation at Sukkur Barrage, the CM said its originally designed capacity was 1.5 million cusecs, but due to hydraulic issues and closure of 10 gates, the capacity has reduced to 960,000 cusecs.
“We must enhance Sukkur Barrage’s capacity,” he emphasised.
The CM also expressed concern over the fragile condition of some embankments along the Indus River.
He noted that Japan is assisting Sindh in strengthening these embankments, particularly the KK Bund and Qadirpur-Shank Bund, and expressed hope that the projects would materialise soon.
He underlined the importance of restoring natural waterways to manage monsoon floods.
“After the construction of barrages in the 1930s, the Katcha region came into existence, altering the natural flow,” he said, adding that Sindh has 14 canals and both the Right Bank and Left Bank of the Indus must have their natural drainage paths restored.
He urged the federal government to support Sindh in increasing the Sukkur Barrage’s capacity.
Dr Musadik Malik assured him of full cooperation and reiterated that international assistance is essential to tackle the adverse impacts of climate change.

According to a statement issued by the Lakki Marwat police, the terrorist — identified as Kifayatullah — was killed during an exchange of fire with the cops.
“The police, upon receiving information about a suspected hideout in Nawar Khel, led a Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) team and carried out the operation, during which one police constable was left injured due to an exchange of fire with the terrorists,” the statement said.
Ammunition and a Kalashnikov were recovered from the slain terrorist, it added.
According to the police statement, the “exchange of fire went on for a long time, during which the police retaliated bravely.” It added that a clearance operation was underway in Nawar Khel.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Bannu region Sajjad Khan lauded the bravery of the police officers who participated in the operation.
“Our officers are always ready to fight for their homeland,” he said in a statement. “Their resolve to thwart terrorists’ attempts is ironclad”.
In August, terrorists in Lakki Marwat carried out a series of militant
attacks
, killing three soldiers and a woman while injuring three others, including two soldiers.
Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. Militant attacks have become more frequent in recent months, despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.",2025-09-03,Umar Bacha,416,9.1e-05

According to officials, the suspects were allegedly involved in multiple cases of robbery, dacoity, and murder.
In Vehari, CCD teams carried out three operations resulting in the deaths of six suspects and injuries to one.
In the first incident, a patrolling team encountered seven armed men who had reportedly set up an illegal checkpoint at Chak No. 77/WB and were looting passersby.
Upon spotting the police van, the suspects opened fire. Police returned fire in self-defence, injuring three suspects Zakir Hussain, Ahmad, and Javed while four others fled towards Chak No. 81/WB. The injured succumbed to their injuries at hospital. Police recovered a handgun, a pump-action shotgun, two 12-bore pistols, a motorcycle, and three mobile phones from the scene.
In another operation near Chak No. 83/WB, CCD personnel signalled four motorcyclists to stop for checking. The suspects opened fire, prompting a retaliatory response. When the exchange ended, two suspects Tariq and Naveed were found dead, while their accomplices managed to escape. Two 30-bore pistols were recovered.
In the third Vehari incident, CCD officials signalled an auto-rickshaw to stop. Two men exited the vehicle and allegedly opened fire. Police responded, and one suspect, identified as Mazhar, was killed in the exchange. His accomplices fled, and a pistol was recovered from the site.
In Multan, CCD teams faced armed resistance during two separate patrols. In one incident near 18-Kasi, three individuals were signalled to stop but opened fire, injuring constables Arif and Muhammad Sharif. Both sustained bullet wounds to the chest and arms but survived due to their bulletproof jackets. Police returned fire and found one suspect, Jaleel, injured at the scene. He later died at a nearby hospital. Officials said Jaleel was a proclaimed offender wanted in 46 criminal cases, including robbery-cum-murder and dacoity.
In another Multan operation near Awan Chowk, CCD personnel signalled two motorcyclists to stop. The suspects opened fire and lost control of their vehicle, crashing into a wall. One suspect, Ajmal Sheikh, was injured and arrested, while the other escaped. A pistol was recovered.
In Shujaabad, CCD claimed to have injured a suspected robber during an encounter near Thakurwali Bridge. A patrolling team signalled three motorcyclists coming from Hayat Khanwala to stop. The suspects opened fire, and police retaliated.
After the exchange, one suspect, identified as Zulfiqar alias Zulfa, was found injured while two others fled. A pistol was recovered from the scene.

The first information report (FIR) of the incident was filed at the Gulshan-i-Iqbal Police Station a day ago against the eight suspects under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common
object), 337A (punishment for assault), 337H(ii) (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent act), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 25 (use of a firearm to commit a criminal offence) of the 2013 Sindh Arms Act.
The incident occurred because workers at the call centre took the complainant’s daughter, another employee, hostage, according to the FIR.
“My daughter works at the call centre, but she has been harassed by the branch manager for the past three years,” the complainant stated. “She was frustrated by it, so she told my son. My nephew also called the branch manager and told him to stay away from her.
“When my daughter went to work on September 23 (Tuesday), the manager called my nephew and said, ‘You didn’t come to me, do whatever you want’,” the complainant added. “My sister, nephews and I went to the office at 9pm, but the doors were locked. They were keeping my daughter hostage.”
The complainant alleged that the branch manager hurled abuse while another person drew a gun on them and fired shots when he and his nephews broke down the door and entered the premises.
“My nephew returned fire, while the office guard also drew his weapon and began firing,” the complainant said.
According to the FIR, someone reported the gunshots on the police helpline and personnel soon arrived at the scene, arresting five people for the firing, while three others were detained for causing the incident.
It added that the police also seized weapons and ammunition from the suspects.
In February, a young man was
arrested

sentences
awarded by military courts.
Chief Justice Aalia Neelum heard the petition filed by a citizen, Raheb Mehboob.
A counsel for the petitioner contended that the Supreme Court had directed the federal government to introduce an amendment in the law granting the right to appeal to those convicted by military courts.
He pointed out that the attorney general for Pakistan had assured the apex court that the government would amend the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) and the Official Secrets Act (OSA) to allow for the convicts’ appeal.
The counsel argued that the apex court’s order had not been complied with by the government.
After hearing the initial contention, the chief justice summoned the federal secretary for law in person at the next hearing.
The chief justice remarked that the government took no time in its desired legislation, but despite the Supreme Court’s order, the amendments have not been made yet.
CJ Neelum directed the law secretary to appear before the court and present an explanation on the matter.
The chief justice would resume the hearing on Sept 25.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942563/us-official-calls-on-islamabad-to-engage-with-afghan-taliban,US official calls on Islamabad to engage with Afghan Taliban - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: Days after Pakistan asked the Afghan Taliban to
choose
whether they want to stand with their neighbour, or the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­­i­s­tan (TTP) militant group, a key US official has called on Islamabad to seek a political settlement with Kabul.
Zalmay Khalilzad, who was named US special representative to Afghanistan during the previous Trump administration, also called on Afghanistan to “help Pakistan with such negotiations”.
The former diplomat recently undertook a
visit
to Kabul alongside US hostage envoy Adam Boehler, where he met with key members of the Afghan Taliban regime.
In a tweet
posted
after he wrapped up his visit, Khalilzad noted that violence between Pakistan’s security forces and the TTP had resulted in the deaths of a significant number of security personnel and citizens.
Imran echoes Khalilzad’s views, terms dialogue with Kabul only way to achieve lasting peace
Saying that he believed pursuing a military solution to this challenge was a mistake, he called on Islamabad to “shift to a political strategy and negotiate”.
“The Pakistani establishment always advised the US and Afghan government before 2021 to negotiate and seek a political settlement with the Afghan Taliban. The time has come for Pakistan to consider doing the same,” he said.
The timing of the message is significant, as it comes just days after PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir gave Kabul a stark choice.
“I want to give a clear message to Afghanistan to choose between Pakistan and TTP,” PM Shehbaz had said during a
visit
to Bannu alongside the army chief.
Although President Trump and US military officials such as CENTCOM chief Gen Michael Kurilla have repeatedly praised Pakistan’s counterterror cooperation — with the arrest of IS-Khorasan operative who targeted the Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate in 2021 being a highlight — Khalilzad’s message seems to be the first indication that the US wants both Islamabad and Kabul to come to the table.
In Washington circles, Khalilzad is viewed as a hawk. He openly sympathises with jailed PTI founder Imran Khan and has — in the past — reserved critical words for Pakistan.
In a tweet posted just last month, he claimed that Afghanistan’s successful operations against IS-Khorasan had pushed their leadership into Pakistan and alleged that the latter was now becoming a ‘safe haven’ for the militant group.
Imran echoes dialogue call
Khalilzad’s remarks echoed the views of the incarcerated former PM, who has also called for dialogue to address the militancy currently pla­guing the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — where his party is in power.
In a tweet posted to his X account on Tuesday, Mr Khan said that operations initiated in the former tribal areas were leading to rising police, military and civilian casualties.
“This approach can ne­­v­er establish peace. Las­t­ing peace only comes thr­ough dialogue,” he said. He alleged that what was being attempted in KP was merely an atte­mpt to discredit the PTI government, and claimed a military operation would only fuel further terrorism.
As police are diverted to counter the rising threat from terrorism, governance and law and order will collapse, he said. He urged all KP lawmakers to sit with the chief minister to urgently resolve the challenges of the province, and called on his allies — namely Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai — to send a peace delegation to Afghanistan.

convicted PTI leaders
— Dr Yasmin Rashid, Mian Mehmood ur Rasheed, Ejaz Chaudhry and Omer Sarfraz Cheema — have requested the chief justice of Pakistan to instruct the appellate courts to take up all appeals against their convictions and decide the matters within two months.
The demand was made by them in a letter to the chief justice of Pakistan on Tuesday.
The letter seeks attention of the chief justice to the miscarriage of justice inflicted upon them through proceedings before the two anti-terrorism courts in Lahore, which were allegedly tainted by mala fide political considerations rather than by lawful cause.
“From the very outset, our arrests, prosecutions and convictions have been orchestrated not by legal merit but by politically motivated manipulation. Our fundamental rights have been trampled upon through multiple serious violations:
Sections 1.6 and 19 of the ATA, which mandate the right to fair trial and due process were disregarded entirely. Established legal benchmarks regarding evidentiary burden, standards of proof and terrorism-related jurisprudence were ignored. Numerous prosecution witnesses were thoroughly discredited through cross-examination, revealing contradictions and lack of corroboration. Yet their evidence was treated as conclusive.”
The jailed leaders pointed out lack of corroborating evidence — CCTV, geofencing, safe city footage and digital records to substantiate the charges laid against them.
Despite being imprisoned for 28 months, the prosecution had yet to prove allegations against Mr. Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi, who was allegedly the principal conspirator, they wrote.
“Those who held press conferences to quit the PTI have been given clean chits, pre-arrest and post-arrest bails granted and their challans delayed so far. Prosecution has selectively submitted challans of a few out of 34 persons held guilty by the joint investigation team in September 2023.”
They appealed to the chief justice to issue orders for conclusion of the appellate proceedings. They requested him to direct the Lahore High Court to conclude all pending appeals and suspension applications of political prisoners within two months.

A spokesman for the FIA said in a statement one of the suspects was posted as Deputy Director at FGEHF. Other suspects are beneficiaries of funds obtained through corruption and fraud, said the spokesman.
According to the initial investigation, the suspects are involved in forgery and fraud by abusing their authority. They were involved in forgery and corruption in the supplementary award of built-up properties (BUPs) of sub-sectors of Mouza Thala Sayedan G-14.
The accused allegedly illegally showed private individuals as co-owners of 5 BUPs, along with the BUPs given to the original owners. Private individuals received funds based on false information.
The FIA said that the accused committed the forgery with the connivance of government officials.
The aforementioned fraud caused a loss of millions of rupees to the national treasury. The suspects have been arrested and an investigation has been launched against them, said the spokesman.
Meanwhile, FIA’s four sub-inspectors and an LDC involved in poor investigation and breach of discipline were dismissed from their jobs.
The dismissal of five officials came about during the “orderly room” conducted by director general FIA Rifat Mukhtar Raja. The FIA spokesman said that the DG FIA held a hearing on departmental actions against officials involved in malicious and poor investigation and breach of discipline in the orderly room.
The convicted officers were posted in Islamabad, Faisalabad and Lahore zones. The DG FIA said that there is no place for officials involved in negligence, carelessness and poor investigation in the institution. Disciplinary action will be ensured against officials involved in corruption, malpractice and negligence, the DG said.

He said the Sindh government has consistently raised the city issues with the federal authorities in Islamabad, while at the party level, he has repeatedly engaged with the PML-N to push for the fulfillment of commitments made to the metropolis.
“At the government level, it’s the Sindh and federal governments that interact, while at the party level, it’s the PPP and PML-N that engage,” the PPP leader said while talking to reporters in Karachi when asked about Islamabad’s apparent lack of interest in addressing Karachi issues.
“We repeatedly draw the prime minister’s attention to Karachi’s key issues, including projects like K-IV. And we remain hopeful that the prime minister will continue working on his promise to bring ‘Shehbaz Speed’ to Karachi’s development,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari said.
Says Sindh govt has consistently raised city’s issues with federal authorities
The PPP chairman also offered a nuanced take on the federal government’s response to recent floods — simultaneously praising the declaration of an
agricultural emergency
and relief in August electric bills as welcome steps, while criticising the failure to launch a global aid appeal for the affected communities, calling it “unfortunate”.
He explained the reasons behind his persistent call for the issuance of a global aid appeal, stating that the delay in doing so is directly hindering timely assistance and relief efforts for flood-affected people.
“When a disaster of this scale strikes, the immediate response should be to reach out to international organisations that are specifically established to help in such situations,” he said.
“You inform them that a natural calamity has hit your country, and seek assistance from those who have the technical expertise — whether in health, disaster management, or climate-related challenges. Unfortunately, that appeal still hasn’t been made. As a result, the immediate relief and rescue support that Pakistan should have received has yet to arrive,” the PPP leader said.

• PDMA says monsoon ends; rivers across Punjab return to normal levels
• Gilani calls for BISP role in relief
LAHORE: The Punjab government will establish flood relief committees at district and tehsil levels to oversee aid and rehabilitation in areas devastated by recent floods.
“A survey form, a mobile application and a central monitoring dashboard will ensure effective aid distribution and oversight,” Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said while chairing a meeting on Friday.
She directed officials to initiate comprehensive rehabilitation efforts for affected families, ensure the immediate restoration of roads and bridges and devise simple, effective procedures for providing assistance.
The chief minister said the floods had impacted 3,775 villages across 64 tehsils in 27 districts, damaging more than 63,000 concrete houses and over 309,000 mud houses.
Survey teams comprising officials from the Urban Unit, Revenue Department, Agriculture Department and the Pakistan Army will collect data to ensure accurate assessments.
CM Maryam emphasised that no victim should be left without support. “We will compensate each individual for their losses so that no one is deprived of their rightful relief,” she said, directing the establishment of additional relief camps and distribution points.
Sutlej breach submerges villages
A devastating breach of the Sutlej River at Noraja Bhutta has intensified the crisis in south Punjab, inundating 150 more villages across Multan, Lodhran and Bahawalpur districts. Thousands have been displaced as floodwaters encroached on a 20-kilometre stretch near the Multan-Sukkur M-5 Motorway.
In Bahawalpur, villages including Nowshera Jadeed, Saadullahpur, Soiwala, Nai Basti and Basti Chakar were submerged. In Lodhran, Adam Wahan, Munshi Wala, Jhangra and Thali Wala were washed away.
Jalalpur Pirwala remains under water, with authorities reviewing a plan to breach the motorway to redirect floodwaters into the Chenab. A technical committee is expected to deliberate on the plan.
Multan Division Commissioner Amir Karim Khan visited Jalalpur Pirwala to supervise rescue and relief operations. He inspected the
damaged motorway section
, where National Highway Authority officials briefed him on ongoing repair work using heavy machinery.
Motorway police spokesperson Imran Shah said the M-5 was closed due to flooding, with diversions set up for travellers. Alternate routes through the national highway from Shah Shams and Uch Sharif interchanges were being provided.
Fatalities, losses
Punjab Disaster Manage­ment Aut­hority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said the death toll in Punjab had reached 123. Speaking at a press conference, he noted that floodwaters were receding in several areas, with boat operations discontinued as water levels dropped.
He confirmed the end of the monsoon season and said all rivers had returned to normal levels, except for a slightly higher flow in the Sutlej.
However, water remains on 10-12 kilometres of the M-5 motorway, keeping a 22-kilometre section closed.
He stated that water from the Indus River did not cause any problems. “A breached section of the bridge has been filled in,” Mr Kathia said.
A report from the South Punjab Secretariat confirmed large-scale hu­­man and material losses, including 45 deaths. Around 1.17 million people were affected and 1,112 villages inundated. Floods also damaged 1.17m acres of farmland and destroyed crops on 1.25m acres.
Relief efforts include 1,145 camps providing food, medicine and other essentials. More than 1.5m people and 1.47m livestock have been evacuated. Medical treatment has been provided to 451,978 people, and 848,119 animals have been treated.
BISP relief
Earlier, PPP’s Acting President Yusuf Raza Gilani visited Jalalpur Pirwala and reviewed the flood situation.
Speaking to the media, he said that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has demanded that flood victims be assisted through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
He
held a meeting
with Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah two days ago and discussed political matters and flood-affected areas.
He said that Mr Bhutto-Zardari had stressed BISP’s role in relief efforts while Rana Sanaullah was of the view that assistance to flood-affected people would be conducted through other programmes.
Mr Gilani urged the government to reconsider their decision to help flood-affected people from other programmes and said that the flood victims’ families should be supported via the BISP.

The FGEHA had opened the tender in December 2024 to award a contract for infrastructure development work in sub-sector G-14/1. The lowest bid of Rs3.92bn turned out to be 25 per cent higher than the estimated cost of Rs3.13bn.
Later, the FGEHA cancelled the bid in July this year without issuing a work order. The contractor then moved the Islamabad High Court (IHC), which directed the FGEHA board to decide the matter through a speaking order within 30 days, after giving the petitioner a proper hearing.
Sources said the FGEHA board took up the matter in its previous meeting and formed a three-member committee. On September 11, the committee proposed a way forward before the executive board, which also gave a hearing to the contractor.
They said that following the board’s recommendation, the FGEHA on September 17 formed an internal committee “to examine and review the matter”.
A letter issued after the 42nd Executive Board meeting held on September 11 stated, “The board granted the petitioner [contractor] a hearing in light of IHC directions and directed DG FGEHA to examine and review the case on merit and dispose of the petition through a speaking order in light of findings and recommendations of the board-constituted committee under the Managing Director, Pakistan Housing Foundation, and relevant laws/rules. The order must be passed within 15 days, under intimation to the FGEHA board,” read the notification dated September 17.
The newly constituted four-member committee is headed by Project Director of Life Style Residency Attaul-Haq Waqas, Director Law Basit Khan, Director Joint Venture Faiz Umer Sial and Deputy Director FGEHA Ammer Hamza.
Meanwhile, sources said that hours after the FGEHA board hearing, the construction company, in writing, offered a 10pc rebate on its quoted rate to seek restoration of the bid. “If the bid is restored, work will be started immediately, otherwise we will have to go for fresh tendering,” said an official.
“This 10.6pc rebate of our quoted bid is being extended solely to support the objection of the FGEHA board and contribute positively towards the successful execution of the project,” read the construction firm’s letter.
It is relevant to note that in response to the FGEHA tender, four firms had applied, but only one was declared a qualified bidder.
However, according to FGEHA, the disqualified bidders did not oppose the criteria.
Sources said the internal audit wing of FGEHA and the Chief Engineer had raised objections to the bidding process. Following these objections, the bidding was annulled in July this year.
The allottees of sector G-14/1 have been waiting for proper facilities for years.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944603,"Operations against Katcha area criminals: Punjab police lack modern drones, armoured personnel carriers - Newspaper - DAWN.COM","LAHORE: The Punjab police badly need to equip themselves with modern-day drone technology and the Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) for launching effective ground operations in inaccessible Katcha areas, while, in comparison, Sindh police is better equipped for taking on networks of hardened criminals operating from the hard areas.
According to the latest reports, Sindh police have a clear edge over the Punjab police when it comes to resources to fight the hardened criminals in the Katcha areas stretching along the river Indus, marked by forests, bushes and rugged terrain.
Although the Katcha areas extend to many districts of the central and southern Sindh, the districts such as Kashmore, Ghotki, Shikarpur and Jacobabad are particularly notorious for high prevalence of crimes like dacoity, kidnap for ransom and tribal conflicts.
On the other hand, in Punjab the Kacha areas of Rajanpur, Dera Ghazi Khan and Rahim Yar Khan are infested with gangs involved in kidnap for ransom, murder and other heinous crimes.
An official says that such gangs of criminals could be never eradicated completely, despite many operations conducted by the law enforcement agencies (LEAs), mainly because most parts of the Katcha area are hard to access for the LEAs.
Sindh police are using drones fitted with thermal cameras, sensors and can deliver payload
He says the dacoits gangs in these areas are equipped with heavy and sophisticated weapons, including mortars, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and even anti-aircraft guns, which they use to target police and other LEAs. He adds that such weapons have been used to even blow up armoured vehicles in many instances, in the past.
Given the situation, he says, the Punjab police high-ups believe that drone technology and the APCs could play an effective role in the fight against the hardened criminals and terrorists belonging to various banned outfits residing in the ‘inaccessible’ Katcha areas of both provinces.
Recently, he says, the Punjab government approved provision of four new APCs to Rahim Yar Khan and the Rajanpur police to launch operations against the hardened criminals and the terrorists infiltrating the Katcha areas from Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Currently, he says, the RY Khan and Rajanpur districts police have five APCs each, which are insufficient, keeping in view the scale of criminal and terrorist activities in the Katcha areas.
Of these vehicles, each of the districts has three ‘tracked APCs’ for off-road mobility in the Katcha area, while others are ‘wheeled APCs’.
On the other hand, in Sindh, Kashmor and Shikarpur districts police have 18 modern APCs each, most of them tracked, for deployment in the Katcha areas of the province.
To a question, the official says that tracked vehicles are more effective in the rugged areas having rough terrain.
“The modern tracked APCs can operate better in difficult terrains, such as mud, sand and uneven ground, where wheeled vehicles may get stuck,” the official says, adding that the Punjab government lags behind in equipping its police force with tracked APCs.
In the past, the Punjab police had a bitter experience when one of its APCs got stuck in mud in the Katcha area, providing an opportunity to the criminals to strike and inflict a heavy loss of life on the force.
About the drone technology, the official says that Sindh police are using drones having the capacity to deliver explosive payload against the criminals, declaring it a big shift in security paradigm due to a change in technology of surveillance and operational modes.
He says such modern drones carrying explosives are being used by Sindh police in search and rescue missions. He adds that the drones being used by Sindh police are also equipped with thermal cameras and high-resolution optical sensors, while they are being also used to fire small mortars to hit the hideouts of the criminals in the inaccessible Katcha areas.
Meanwhile, he says, Punjab police are using drones for surveillance only.
The official says that the Punjab police avoid launching operations deep into the inaccessible areas for lack of the latest technology. However, the police have managed to develop infrastructure to set up posts and checkpoints in such areas, he adds.
He says the police are also constructing soling tracks to improve access and mobility in the challenging terrain of the Katcha areas.
The establishment of such infrastructure is a part of a broader strategy to launch a massive operation, supported by the provincial government, to clear the Katcha areas of hardened criminals and terrorists.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945585/let-the-games-begin,Let the games begin - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"MUCH is happening in the world around us but at home, there is little to report or talk about. The messy Pakistani politics that doesn’t even believe in a day of rest is rather dull these days, forcing many of us in anchor-land to discuss foreign policy and the Middle East. It ain’t really out of choice and let no one tell you otherwise.
However, it’s not just the lot on television but also those in politics who seem to have run out of choices. If one had to describe politico-land in Pakistan these days; there are a bunch of headless chickens running around and clucking non-stop. None has a clue as to what to do and this is as true of those in power as it is of those in opposition. The only aim is to survive.
Consider the PTI leadership, which is caught between the establishment and its supporters. The second tier is mostly doing the bidding of one while pretending to care about the latter (and they are fearful of both). And while it’s hard to tell what the establishment wants, the view of the workers and supporters was evident from the recent lacklustre
jalsa
in Peshawar.
Perhaps this is why the KP chief minister’s speech, too, lacked the bombast of his earlier speeches — he knows no one will buy his Gabbar Singh act. The booing and jeering during his speech (and those of others), along with his being greeted by workers waving shoes at him had Ali Amin Gandapur run to Adiala on Monday morning, in the hope of a meeting — a meeting that he and those around him had been at pains to explain wasn’t being allowed.
No one doubts anymore that his ‘chief ministry’ is now less dependent on the PTI and more on the real power bosses. Indeed, if he is in power, it is not because of the man in Adiala. And that is because, the chief minister appears confident that Imran Khan is going to remain a resident of Adiala for some time.
It’s not just the lot on television but also those in politics who seem to have run out of choices.
However, in light of the mood in the province regarding the party leadership’s behaviour and the issue of militancy, this tightrope walk is going to become more and more difficult. Everyone is holding their breath to see how long it lasts. In the meantime, the PTI wallahs in the KP government and in parliament in Islamabad are going to run around in circles, achieving little other than exhausting themselves.
But it has to be said that the PTI’s routine shenanigans could not top what the Noonies got up to in New York. A
meeting
with President Donald Trump at the UN and a tête-à-tête at the Oval Office was too good an opportunity not to mess up and this is exactly what the PML-N managed to do. The boomers took a molehill on social media and turned it into a mountain on the mainstream.
The
presence
of Shama Junejo, a British-Pakistani woman who was part of the Pakistani delegation, caused a social media skirmish, among a dime-a-dozen other fights, till the defence minister decided to tweet that he didn’t know her or who made her sit behind him during a speech — as if ministers are usually aware of who is sitting or standing behind them at most public events.
His tweet disturbed the slumber of the Foreign Office, run by the deputy prime minister himself, which also decided to distance itself from Junejo’s presence. And voila! the mainstream media had a story to report and discuss in the midst of all else that can’t be mentioned. Junejo continues to remain confident that she was there because of the prime minister, and no one — be it ministers or the FO — has denied this or asked him about the issue. There really is no mystery here but let’s all pretend there is one because it does draw attention away from other issues, such as, how can there be a solution for Gaza without addressing the West Bank or who decided Pakistani government officials are cut out for interviews.
But uncomfortable questions are a no-no, so let’s stick to who let a woman into the UN General Assembly. Asking obvious questions and pretending there is no answer is how we roll these days.
This wasn’t the only (non) political news of the week. The PPP-PML-N public
spat
was another. Thankfully, Maryam Nawaz and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari stepped in, otherwise the media would have been forced to spend hours on the statements of Sharjeel Memon and Azma Bokhari, two people whose press conferences are as hard to watch as a Netflix rom-com. But then, the heirs apparent came to our rescue and we had a pretend fight on our hands.
How serious was the back and forth, it was asked, while we wrung our hands. As if there was not just one answer. The ending is as obvious as the one in a Pakistani drama with an evil mother-in-law and an innocent daughter-in-law.
The PPP and N spat is no different. This arrangement drawn up by the grown-ups which allows everyone to rule, reign and make merry is not going to fall apart on disagreements on the handling of the floods or because N is not taking the PPP on board in Punjab. The handful of PPP Punjab will continue to huff and puff and their seniors in Sindh will pretend to agree.
While walking out is not an option, because our politicos believe that the people watching and voting are stupid, there will be verbal sparring as if there are some principles involved. For the PPP, it’s the Devdas-like concern for the people, while for the PML-N it’s this belief that Maryam Nawaz is doing so well that the PPP is worried about N’s growing popularity in Punjab. Delulu is their solulu. On the television screens, at least.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944614/shortage-of-beds-trained-staff-affects-neonates-care-in-kp-hospitals,"Shortage of beds, trained staff affects neonates’ care in KP hospitals - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","PESHAWAR: The shortage of beds for neonates has been compelling people to admit their newborns to ill-equipped private hospitals in Peshawar and elsewhere in the province, according to health experts.
“As districts have few nursery wards due to which patients are being shifted to Peshawar where shortage of beds has become a serious issue. As a result, patients land in private hospitals where specialised services are not available,” a paediatrician told this scribe. He said that except a few private hospitals, others did not have paediatricians or neonatologists but they admitted patients to make money.
He said that recently a patient was taken to Lady Reading Hospital where all the 40 beds were occupied and parents took the child to a nearby general private hospital where he was kept in air-conditioned ward. His condition deteriorated and the next day his parents were asked to bring him to LRH but he died the same day, he added.
“Actually, the child required to be kept in warm place but he remained in cold room in private hospital which caused server complications. The private hospital has no child specialist,” said the paediatrician.
Experts say most of newborns land in ill-equipped private health facilities
He said that medical teaching institutions (MTIs) including LRH, Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH) and Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC) had nursery wards but they always remained full to the capacity and even they had to admit multiple neonates on same beds that also created complications.
The paediatrician said that newborns easily fell ill due to weak immunity. Peshawar-based hospitals were also faced with severe shortage of staff and poor referral system, he added.
He said that many experienced doctors, who were civil servants, were transferred from MTIs, leaving children at the mercy of junior doctors.
Another senior paediatrician said that there had been no increase in beds in Peshawar’s hospitals whereas the number of patients had increased manifold. “Children are brought to Peshawar and they are referred from one hospital to another. After failure to get space, they land in private hospitals, he said.
Authorities in most of the Peshawar-based hospitals say that they can’t admit more patients due to lack of space.
Paediatricians say that children are almost half of the population but there are neither enough beds for them in hospitals, nor trained neonatologists to treat them effectively.
The only dedicated 200-bed children hospital, part of Khyber Institute of Child Health (KICH), is yet to see light of the day despite the lapse of 15 years. As a result, paediatricians having qualification in different sub-specialties are working in other provinces or have gone abroad.
“The children hospital, the construction of which has been completed 90 per cent, will accommodate about 20 child specialists after starting operations. Health department is actively working to launch it,” they said.
Presently, nursery units at Peshawar’s three medical teaching institutions are overcrowded with patients round the clock, but the shortage of beds and trained staff is compromising their treatment.
The process of upgradation of child health facilities was too slow as nursery ward at Bacha Khan Medical Complex, Swabi, was recently upgraded from 15 to 46 beds, which according to doctors, now receive patients from the nearby Buner, Haripur, Nowshera and Attock districts.
However, situation in Peshawar is yet to improve as KTH has 35 nursery beds, LRH and HMC 40 each, which are not sufficient to accommodate child patients coming from the whole province.
Health experts said that most common health issues among neonates were premature birth, low weight and oxygen deficiency. Those issues were manageable through trained and well-equipped health workers, they added.
Another paediatrician said the province’s hospitals had just 2,000 beds for children compared to more than 60,000 for adults. Except, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, all the provinces had dedicated children hospitals. “Children suffer due to shortage of beds in hospitals for them. Poor parents are the most affected people as they couldn’t afford cost of private hospitals or shifting their children to other provinces,” he said.

This failure attracted the attention of Federal Ombudsman Ejaz Ahmad Qureshi, who took notice and directed the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) to take urgent remedial measures in view of the public suffering.
On the direction of Islamabad High Court and Wafaqi Mohtasib (Federal Ombudsman), the civic agency in 2022 had set up Stray Dogs Population Control Centre in Tarlia area to control the population of stray dogs through the ‘trap, neuter, vaccinate and release’ (TNVR) method.
The centre was supposed to neuter and release at least 800 dogs per month. Initially, this centre performed well for some months, as surgeries were conducted followed by the release of the dogs.
Directs CDA to take to remedial measures
Later on, sources said that when the contract was ended last year, the performance of the centre nosedived, as the process of TNVR was stopped; therefore, the population of stray dogs witnessed an increase in Islamabad.
Currently, there are reports that the centre is serving like an ‘incarceration centre’ for stray dogs, as staff of the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI), after catching dogs, put them in this centre, allegedly “till death”.
Whereas there is no system in place for vaccination and food for ‘arrested’ dogs, yet dogs are surviving based on waste food and scraps provided by hotel owners. There was also a dedicated helpline 1819 for registration of complaints against the presence of stray dogs, which is now out of order.
When contacted, a couple of officials of the Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA) of MCI denied that the facility is serving as an incarceration centre, claiming that dogs, after being kept in SDPCC for some days, are relocated to far-flung areas.
“We have special arrangements with hotels, which provide us with free food for these dogs. All dogs are being properly taken care of,” an official of DMA said, claiming that doctors and staff of ICT wildlife department helping DMA for better care and treatment of these dogs as well. “We regularly and daily catch stray dogs,” he said.
“The problem of stray dogs is increasingly becoming acute due to negligence on the part of the municipal authorities in Islamabad and is causing serious hardship to senior citizens, women and children.
“However, sufficient attention is not being paid to this critical area. According to reports, a large number of people, including children and the elderly, are bitten by the stray dogs,” read a statement issued by the Ombudsman’s office.
It said that in view of the magnitude of this problem, the Wafaqi Mohtasib Office had commissioned a professional study, which revealed that the policy of the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board has not been implemented in letter and spirit.
“Besides suggesting practical measures, the study also shed light on ways and means adopted by other countries of the region for tackling the issue. In this regard, Wafaqi Mohtasib had also constituted a high-level committee tasked to hold meetings with the authorities concerned for recommending measures to tackle this menace,” it said and added. “Resultantly, a dog centre was established at Tarlai under the name of SDPCC. The project, however, failed to deliver, and the problem remained,” read the press release.
Before the centre was established, the CDA and the MCI used to shoot dogs to control their population, but the high court ordered the authorities to stop this cruelty and directed them to set up a dog centre.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939326/neelum-jhelum-project-a-failure-of-planning-execution,"Neelum-Jhelum project ‘a failure of planning, execution’ - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","• AGP report finds Rs507bn scheme plagued by tunnel collapses, delays and cost overruns
• Flagship project falls short on water rights, power output
ISLAMABAD: The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) has declared the Rs507 billion
Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project
a failure in terms of objectives, planning and execution, saying it neither secured Pakistan’s water rights nor delivered the designed energy output, as its multiple tunnel faults and collapses have raised serious questions about the
quality of work
on a project of national importance.
In its performance audit report for 2022-23, submitted to the president and parliament, the AGP noted that the findings did not even include the major collapse of the headrace tunnel last year, which has kept the project shut. The report was finalised based on responses from Wapda’s management to audit objections.
According to the report, the project faced considerable delays despite the provision of tunnel boring machines (TBMs) meant to speed up excavation, mainly due to design changes.
“The project could not reap envisaged benefits of generation of planned electricity, establishment of water rights over Neelum River, selling of carbon credits under CDM, and completion of mitigation measures to safeguard the environment,” the AGP said.
Although the first unit was commissioned in 2018, contractors failed to complete pending punch list items, fulfil contractual obligations, or supply spare parts needed for smooth operation. “The major collapse in the tailrace tunnel (TRT) of the powerhouse just a few years after construction also casts doubt on the quality of design and works,” it added.
The report recalled that Wapda was to execute the project in line with the original PC-I, approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) in December 1989 at a cost of Rs15.012bn. After three intermediate revisions, Ecnec approved the fourth revised PC-I in May 2018 at Rs506.808bn, against which Rs423.446bn had been spent up to June 2023.
The project was delayed by almost eight years, raising its cost from Rs84.502bn (first revised PC-I) to Rs419.454bn, a cost overrun of Rs334.952bn. The AGP said the project was not executed efficiently as resources were poorly managed and timelines under PC-I were ignored. Contractual issues also remained unresolved due to contractors’ delays.
On its effectiveness, the audit concluded the project failed to deliver its objectives of cheap electricity and securing water rights over the Neelum River. The TRT collapse forced the powerhouse to remain shut until March 2023, leading to massive generation losses and worsening load shedding. “Neither the envisaged benefits of generating 5,150GWh annually were achieved nor water rights over the Neelum River established, particularly after Pakistan lost the Kishenganga case in the International Court of Arbitration,” the report noted.
The four generating units came online between July and December 2018. Funding was arranged through cash development loans from the federal government, Wapda’s own equity, the Neelum-Jhelum surcharge on electricity consumers, and local and foreign loans. The audit was conducted under INTOSAI Auditing Standards, Performance Audit Manual, and relevant rules.
Key audit findings included failure to generate the planned 5,150GWh annually, failure to establish water rights on the Neelum/Kishenganga, a nine-year time overrun, and a cost overrun of Rs338.944bn. Other serious lapses cited were an increase in the project’s payback period from five to 12 years, non-realisation of $50.133m in revenue under the Clean Development Mecha­nism, reduced annual generation, and environmental damage due to poor studies at the planning stage worth Rs3.05bn.
The report also highlighted Rs70.44bn in lost revenue due to non-approval of reference tariff by Nepra, Rs20.387bn in generation losses from the TRT collapse without inquiry, unjustified excess payment of Rs1.78bn to contractors without verifying raw stone aggregate quantities, non-recovery of costs for unexecuted telecom works and advance payments for an 11kV overhead line, undue benefits to contractors due to non-reinstatement of spoil deposits, non-indemnification of a Rs42bn insurance claim for the TRT collapse, and non-supply of spare parts and failure to execute punch list items by contractors.
The AGP concluded that the Neelum-Jhelum project fell short on nearly every planned objective, leaving behind massive financial losses, unresolved contractual disputes, and serious structural flaws.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943080,CJP Afridi lends ear to Imran’s plight in jail - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"• PTI lawyer delivers incarcerated chief’s letter to top judge; says Justice Afridi asked them to move proper application for redressal
• Aleema says she’ll visit Supreme Court today to inquire about ‘outcome’
• Ex-PM urges CJP to intervene to fix his pending petitions, requests ‘justice in real time’
ISLAMABAD: As PTI leader Imran Khan has been in jail for more than two years, his lawyer Latif Khosa on Thursday approached Chief Justice Yahya Afridi with a
letter
from the former prime minister detailing his hardships in jail and requesting the swift scheduling of his pending cases.
Mr Khosa handed over the letter to the top judge in a meeting that lasted for more than an hour and later told media persons that the CJP had assured a “positive response” to their plight within 24 hours and also asked them to move a proper application in this regard.
To deliver the letter ‘Denial of Justice and Fundamental Rights — A Call to the Supreme Court’, Mr Khosa had arrived with Aleema Khan, Javed Hashmi and other PTI leaders, but the rest were briefly stopped by the police at the entrance of the Supreme Court. However, they were subsequently allowed to enter the premises and they waited there till the conclusion of the meeting between the CJP and Mr Khosa.
After the meeting, Mr Khosa told reporters that the CJP attentively listened to them and assured them that a policy of presenting any arrested person within 24 hours would be ensured.
Mr Khosa said the CJP had sought the ex-premier’s complaints regarding the conditions in jail in writing and assured that his grievances would be addressed and responded to within 24 hours, Dawn.com reported. He said, “We will inform you about whatever happens in [the next] 24 hours.”
Mr Khosa said he had also expressed “our reservations” about the judiciary to the chief justice and raised the matter of jail reforms. “The CJP has sought suggestions over jail reforms,” he said.
Aleema Khan, the sister of Imran Khan who flanked the lawyer during the media interaction, announced they would return to the apex court on Friday to learn about the outcome of the letter penned by Imran Khan.
‘Door of justice’
In his message to the CJP, the former prime minister claimed the “doors of justice remain closed to him and his wife” and he had to endure “continuous solitary confinement”. The PTI lea­der said he had been facing 300 “politically motivated cases” and requested the CJP for an immediate hearing of his pending petitions before all courts. He also demanded medical treatment facilities for his spouse Bushra Bibi and phone calls to his sons as mandated by the jail manual. “Her health continues to deteriorate, yet her doctor is barred from examining her, let alone provide any treatment,” he said in the letter.
According to the PTI chief, thousands of the party’s supporters were in jail and many, including his nephew, were subjected to military trials in violation of the constitutional protections.
His letter also mentioned the ‘leaked’ Commonwealth report on the Feb 8 elections and said the PTI’s mandate was “stolen overnight”. The letter claimed that the 26th Amendment had been used as a tool to sanctify this mandate theft, while petitions challenging it rem­ained unheard in the apex court.
The letter alleged that the Islamabad High Court chief justice deliberately refused to fix his Al-Qadir Trust – the £190m corruption case – and Toshakhana appeals.
The IHC top judge has allegedly fully abandoned impartiality and reduced the high court to a facilitator of an “unjust and tyrannical campaign” against him and those associated with him. He urged the CJP to direct Justice Sarfraz Dogar to fix critical petitions, including in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
The letter also alluded to the hanging of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Bhutto was hanged in a prison in Rawalpindi on April 4, 1979, whereas the Supreme Court held in 2024 that fair trial and due process requirements were not met. “Just­ice in its truest sense must happen in real time, pyrrhic justice occurs 44 years later,” the letter said.
“I, as Patron-In-Chief of Pakist­an’s largest political party; seek only what the Constitution guarantees: justice, dignity, and equality before law,” the letter said.

The militants retaliated by firing rockets at the security forces.
According to police sources, the militants managed to flee during the exchange of fire. However, a local councillor, Ashrafa BiBi, wife of Maulana Noor Zaman, was caught in the crossfire and sustained serious injuries. She was being shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital in Wana, but she succumbed to her wounds on the way. Her body was later handed over to relatives after postmortem.
The local government representatives strongly condemned the incident, terming it a tragic loss, and demanded a transparent inquiry into the circumstances leading to her death. They also urged the authorities to announce a martyr’s compensation package for the councillor.
It is worth mentioning that only a day earlier, on Wednesday, heavy exchange of fire between security forces and militants in the Azam Warsak area of Birmal tehsil had left four people injured, including two women and two children.
On the other hand armed men on Thursday abducted a youth named Abid from Azam Warsak Bazaar in Birmal tehsil. Police sources said the assailants forcibly took the boy away on a motorcycle to an undisclosed location.
Soon after the incident, police cordoned off the area and launched an investigation.

The war of words, which began over
flood compensation
through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), had
expanded
to water rights on the Indus River a day earlier as the Punjab’s chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself.
At a Faisalabad event on Monday, Maryam defended a controversial canal project on the Indus, rejecting Sindh’s objections and warning the PPP against criticising Punjab’s development — comments that triggered a PPP walkout from the National Assembly today.
Taking the floor of the lower house of Parliament, PPP’s Naveed Qamar said: “Right now, our country is going through a severe flood situation. As we speak, there is a medium-level flood ongoing in my constituency. The onsluaght that came from Punjab has more or less subsided but many rural areas are still submerged. Standing crops were also submerged.”
He added that people were looking toward the country’s leadership during this time, highlighting that a recent
report
released by the Food and Agric­u­lture Organisation (FAO) stated that the floods would also affect upcoming Rabi cultivation.
“Unfortunately, people have not seen rescue efforts following the floods but have seen a lot of politics,” he lamented.
“When it comes to it, we can also make fiery speeches. We can also make something an inter-provincial issue but we have mercy on the people of whose responsibility rests on ours shoulders.
“We cannot absolve ourselves by saying ’it was because of nature’ and leave people to fend for themselves.”
He continued: “In the past few days, there have been statements — and I accept some were from our side — but the escalation that followed and the level to which things went is in no way appropriate.”
Qamar maintained that when PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari visited flood-hit areas, the first thing he did was to praise the Punjab government. “He said that in Punjab, the chief minister and the Punjab government did good work in dealing with the flood situation.”
He added that some people from their camp did not like this but then the “escalation” went in another direction.
“In Punjab, a flood of this size has occurred for the first time. But Sindh has suffered this repeatedly […]. We have gone through this experience, and we have learnt from our mistakes,” he said.
“We learnt that instead of sending flour or sacks, give people cash directly so that they can rebuild their lives,” Qamar said.
“We are your allies, we can give you suggestions. The government is yours, you have to make decisions […] but if we give you advice based on our experiences from the past then why do you turn it into criticism? Why make it a Sindh versus Punjab issue?” he asked.
“‘Our water, our money, our will’ — what does that mean? What does that imply? This is our country and it belongs to all of us […]. Consider our suggestions; if you don’t like them, don’t accept them, but the response should not be what it has been,” he said, mentioning Maryam’s words.
He said he was very “saddened” by the remarks made by her a day prior.
“The Indus is the lifeline of Pakistan. If the Indus exists, Pakistan exists; if the Indus does not exist, Pakistan will not exist. It connects the whole country […] it is neither Sindh’s water nor Punjab’s nor any other province’s. It passes through all and benefits everyone,” he added.
“In such a situation, it is becoming very difficult for us to sit on the treasury benches,” he said. “This is not a partnership. We are not getting a fee to sit with you. If you give us respect, we are with you in national interest. We don’t want ministries or anything else,” he said as other members of the House pounded on their desks.
“Think of the people and look at how partnerships work. We cannot take part in House proceedings until things improve. We are walking out,” he said.
Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said he was apologetic if the PPP was distressed over the comments made by Maryam and called for a dialogue between the two sides.
The NA session was subsequently adjourned till 11am on Friday.
‘Better for provinces to share issues’
Meanwhile, PPP leader Sherry Rehman, in a video posted on the PPP’s X account, said that this matter should be taken up in both Houses of Parliament.
“Whether it is the floods, the canals issue or regarding water reservoirs, we have never adopted an attitude towards Punjab where anyone could point fingers,” she said.
“We have always spoken within the bounds of decency and acted with responsibility. So it is better that both the provinces share their issues with each other,” she said.
She further said that the BISP was globally acknowledged and there was “no comparison”. “It has been recognised at an international level among social protection programmes,” she said, adding that if it was employed effectively then four million people would not currently be in distress.
She questioned how the PPP could be part of such an alliance under the current circumstances and said that the war of words was not the way forward.
“The people are watching all of us and they are looking toward us. Chairman Bilawal has also made it clear that the people should be given effective and complete relief. There is nothing here for anyone to be offended about,” she emphasised, adding that in such an environment it had become difficult to continue supporting the government with consistency.",2025-09-30,Dawn.com,1401,0.000165

Eid Miladun Nabi
(PBUH) have been finalised to make the day memorable in the garrison city, and the illumination of mosques and streets has been completed.
Milad committees and various organisations are arranging Mehfil-i-Milad and the Milad procession.
Youngsters were seen on the roads collecting donations from commuters for street and road decorations, stopping vehicles and requesting donations for a good cause.
In markets and bazaars, traders established committees to gather donations for distributing food among people on the occasion.
Admin designates procession routes, tightens security, bans music and loudspeakers
In Chittian Hattian, Lunda Bazaar, Sarafa Bazaar and Saddar, catering service providers halt all other orders except for Eid Miladun Nabi (PBUH), as most people booked their services for Saturday.
Meanwhile, the district administration and local police also completed arrangements for the day, focusing on security and cleanliness, especially along the traditional route of the Eid Miladun Nabi (PBUH) procession.
To prevent any untoward incidents, district officials engaged religious scholars to foster interfaith harmony in the city.
The main procession will start from Jamia Masjid Rawalpindi on Jamia Masjid Road and end at the same venue after passing through Kohati Bazaar, Murree Road, Iqbal Road, Fawara Chowk, Raja Bazaar, and Purana Qila.
A smaller procession from various main mosques of the union councils will join the main procession at Fawara Chowk.
However, law enforcement agencies designated five points for small processions to merge with the main procession. Law enforcement also identified 12 points along the procession route for participants, with all main roads closed to general traffic during the procession.
The district administration imposed a ban on the use of rickshaws and motorcycles along the procession route and instructed committees not to use loudspeakers in mosques or homes, while musical instruments would be prohibited in the procession.
They also asked Milad committees to submit a list of the vehicles to be used in the main procession so that security measures could be adopted and vehicles checked thoroughly before entering the procession.
The Deputy Commissioner, Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema, stated that religious scholars from different schools of thought had been included in the planning, and the district’s Peace Committee would take part in the procession.
He added that security measures would be taken in the city, primarily on the route of the procession, as the administration had adopted in Muharram.
“All roads and streets will be closed a day earlier on Wednesday, and containers will be placed around Raja Bazaar to prevent acts of terrorism,” he said.
He further mentioned that the Rawalpindi waste management company had been asked to make all the arrangements to keep the city clean.

In a letter, local resident Raja Abdul Rehman requested the CDA chairman for the repair and maintenance of the park, stating that the civic agency’s alleged negligence had caused problems for citizens. He said due to the drainage work carried out by the civic agency, a portion of the walking track had been washed away.
Earlier, another citizen, Omar Iqbal had also written to the CDA management about the issue.
In his letter, Mr Rehman said that last year two young brothers lost their lives due to electrocution in front of Street No 18, F-11/3, when rainwater flooded the street where an electric transformer was situated. After the tragedy, CDA laid down rainwater drainage pipes to divert water into the natural stream through the multipurpose park.
Team urgently directed to visit site to conduct a technical assessment, says official
“Unfortunately, those pipes were laid with serious mismatches and technical faults. The boundary wall of the park was cut, and the pipes discharged water directly into a stream located 20–25 feet below ground level.
During the recent
monsoon rains
, the faulty alignment of these pipes caused severe erosion inside the park,” he said, adding that the walking track (6–7 feet wide) around the park boundary had been washed away.
“A steep gap of 15–20 feet deep has opened up along the track. The soil continues to collapse, leaving dangerously sharp and unstable edges. A single misstep by any child, elderly, or passerby could result in a fatal fall,” he said and demanded the CDA chief for immediate fencing and safety measures around the eroded areas to prevent accidents and urgent repair and realignment of drainage pipes to stop further erosion. Restoration of the walking track and park boundary wall should be ensured for public safety, he said.
When contacted, CDA spokesperson Shahid Kiani said they had taken immediate notice of the complaint raised by the residents of F-11/2.
“A CDA team has been urgently directed to visit the site to conduct a comprehensive technical assessment of the drainage system and identify any faults. CDA will take all immediate safety measures to address the concerns. Based on the team’s report, a plan for permanent rectification, including the repair of drainage pipes, restoration of the walking track, and stabilization of the land, will be developed and executed on a priority basis,” he said and added: “We thank the community for bringing this to our attention and assure them of our full commitment to resolving this issue swiftly and effectively. The CDA remains dedicated to maintaining public spaces and ensuring the safety of all citizens.”
Meanwhile, following the complaint, CDA’s director sports and culture on Monday visited the multipurpose ground and assured the citizens that the civic agency will carry out repair work soon. He also deputed staff for the cleanliness work.

•  Met Office says monsoon system likely to persist till September 3
•  Rainwater accumulates in G-6, G-7, G-11 sectors and Bhara Kahu in Islamabad
•  Traffic disrupted on many roads
RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: Heavy rain lashed the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Monday evening, inundating low-lying areas and causing damage in different parts of the garrison city.
Leh Nullah swelled to 17.5 feet at Gawalmandi Bridge and 19.5 feet at Kattarian Bridge. However, water level receded in the night when the rain stopped.
In the evening, rain and water in Leh Nullah forced the local administration to switch on the sirens of flood warning in the city so that people around Leh Nullah could move to safer places.
The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), Rescue 1122, Civil Defence and health departments called out their officials to deal with any emergency.
Fear and panic ran through the localities adjacent to Leh Nullah and other nullahs in the garrison city with the residents shifting their precious items to the second floors of their houses to avoid damage, especially electricity appliances.
The residents feared that the nullah may burst its banks in case of more rain as the widths of Leh and other nullahs have reduced due to failure of Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) and Rawalpindi Metropolitan Corporation (RMC) to clear its banks of encroachments.
The Meteorological Department recorded 46 millimetres of rain at Saidpur, 100mm at Zero Point, 80mm at Golra, 54mm at Bokra in Islamabad and 30mm at Shamsabad, 12mm at Chaklala, 43mm at Pirwadhai, 13mm at Gawalmandi and 64mm at New Kattarian in Rawalpindi. It forecast more rain till Tuesday evening.
A Met official said monsoon currents from Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea were penetrating into the upper and central parts of the country.
A westerly wave is also affecting upper parts of the country and likely to persist till September 3,” he said.
He said that the widespread rain-wind/thundershower was likely in Kashmir and northeast Punjab and at scattered places in Islamabad and upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The Met Office warned that torrential rains may cause urban flooding in low lying areas/flash floods in nullahs/streams of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Narowal, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Lahore, Kasur, Okara, Sheikhupura, Hafizabad and adjoining areas. Landslides/mudslides may cause roads closures in hilly areas of KP, Murree, Galliyat.
When contacted, Wasa Managing Director Saleem Ashraf said sirens were sounded in localities adjacent to Leh Nullah as water level rose to the pre-alert level of 19.5 feet.
However, he said as the rain stopped in Islamabad, the water level in Leh Nullah reduced from 19.5 feet to 11.5 feet at Kattarian and from form 17.5 feet to 14.5 feet at Gawalmandi by 9pm.
“Less rain occurred in Rawalpindi city but 99mm rain was recorded at Zero Point and G-11 and all the rainwater entered Leh Nullah at Kattarian Bridge which increased the water level in the nullah.”
He said as the cleanliness of nullah was completed, the water discharged into Soan River without any hurdle.
He said that all officials were called to deal with any emergency and to drain out rainwater accumulated on roads adjacent to Leh Nullah.
District Officer Rescue 1122 Sibghatullah told
Dawn
that there was no report about loss of life during the flood-like situation.
He said Rescue 1122 was on alert till the next 48 hours to deal with any untoward situation, adding teams had been deployed in the city and along Soan River.
Islamabad
The heavy spell of rain on Monday evening disrupted traffic in various areas of Islamabad as rainwater accumulated on roads, including Bhara Kahu Bypass and Islamabad Expressway.
According to CDA, 99mm of rain was recorded in H-8, 78mm in Golra and 46mm in Saidpur with an overall average of 70mm across the capital city.
Rainwater accumulated on roads/streets in G-6, G-7 while some streets in G-7 also faced a flood-like situation. However, after a while rainwater drained out naturally.
However, rainwater accumulated in G-11 Markaz, where motorists faced hardships. Similarly, water remained stagnant in a portion of the deputy commissioner office and in the basement of Nadra office at G-10, which was drained out by emergency and rescue teams.
Similarly, water also accumulated on some roads inside the Diplomatic Enclave, which was drained out within an hour.
A massive rainwater accumulation was reported at Bhara Kahu Chowk on Murree Road, raising question marks about the efficiency of concerned departments. Moreover, Bhara Kahu Bypass was also flooded with rainwater.
Meanwhile, a press release issued by the CDA said on the direction of the interior minister, CDA Chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa “personally monitored clearance operations across the federal capital, while Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon accompanied him during the field visits.”
It said immediately after rainfall, CDA and ICT teams launched an operation to drain out water and Diplomatic Enclave and Saidpur Village were completely cleared. Water was also drained from G-11.
It said traffic on all major roads was flowing smoothly.
Traffic alert in Rawalpindi
The city traffic police issued a traffic alert in view of Monday’s heavy rain. A spokesman for the traffic police issued a traffic alert for Jhelum Road updating motorists that the flow of vehicular movement was slightly obstructed near Golf Club Marquee due to rainwater.
A similar traffic alert was issued for Faizabad where traffic flow was obstructed on Murree Road due to an excessive rainwater accumulation. At 9pm, the police said traffic was moving smoothly across all roads though a light drizzling was ongoing.
On the other hand, Rescue 1122 urged citizens to exercise extreme caution during the monsoon season. They also urged the parents never to let their children go near drains and electric poles during rain.

moved
by Islamabad High Court (IHC) Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, challenging a
restraining order
that prevented him from performing his judicial duties.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the bench will consist of Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan.
Filed by Justice Jahangiri in person, the plea asks that the Sept 16 restraining order be set aside and suspended while his current petition is pending, and the division bench that issued it be restrained from proceeding further.
The two-judge division bench, headed by Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and consisting of Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, had issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed by lawyer Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution while raising serious questions about the validity of his
law degree
from the University of Karachi. The petition seeks a writ of quo warranto, questioning “by what authority” Justice Jahangiri holds judicial office.
Islamabad Bar Council moves petition to become party to the case
On Sept 23, Justice Jahangiri had also requested the Supreme Court to fix his appeal saying he could only serve as a judge of IHC till a particular age and time lost due to the operation of the impugned order cannot be regained by him.
In a two-page application moved before the Supreme Court, Justice Jahangiri had stated the Supreme Court must urgently intervene in the matter so that the petitioner can be restored and could continue to dispense justice in the high court that he serves in.
On reasons for urgency the application pleaded that the crucial decision to restrain a judge from performing his judicial function was made without even hearing the counter position, adding he was never heard.
Meanwhile, the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) also moved a petition to become party in Justice Jahangiri’s appeal. The petition was moved jointly by members of IBC namely Syed Ahmad Hassan Shah, Naseer Ahmad Kiyani, Raja Muhammad Aleem Khan Abbasi, Syed Qamar Hussain Shah Sabzwari, Zulfiqar Ali Abbasi and Adil Aziz Qazi.
Moved under Article 185(3) of the Constitution, the IBC petition argued that the Sept 16 order was arbitrary, capricious and against the settled principles of law, where Supreme Court remains bound to intervene to obviate miscarriage of justice.
It was a settled law that no injunction can be passed without the three ingredients of a prima facie case, irreparable loss and balance of convenience of being met.

case involving an attack on a Supreme Court judge’s squad vehicle, issuing perpetual arrest warrants for social media activist Sanam Javed and four other absconding convicts, and also ordering the arrest of fashion designer Khadija Shah.
In this case, Judge Manzer Ali Gill of the ATC-I on Sept 9
acquitted
former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while sentencing Dr Yasmin Rashid, Umar Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, and former senator Ejaz Chaudhry to ten years’ imprisonment each.
Khadija Shah, a granddaughter of former army chief Asif Nawaz Janjua, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.
Ms Shah and 13 other convicts failed to appear in court on the day the verdict was announced at Kot Lakhpat Jail.
ATC judge says it is well established that police officials are as credible as private witnesses, unless bias can be proven
The judge issued perpetual arrest warrants for proclaimed offenders, including Sanam Javed, Muhammad Siddiq, Tayyab Ali, Syed Faisal Akhtar, and Zarif Khan.
The court acquitted former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, ruling that his case was different from the others.
It noted that the evidence showed he was not present at the scene on the day of the incident, as he had traveled from Multan to Karachi.
In the detailed judgement, the judge observed that during the entire proceedings of the case, most of the defence counsel focused their efforts on arguing that no such incident had taken place at Rahat Bakery Chowk.
“But on the other hand, the prosecution’s case rests upon both oral and documentary evidence. It is a universal truth that a man can lie, but a document cannot,” the judge noted.
He observed that in today’s modern and digital era, the occurrence or non-occurrence of any incident cannot be concealed—just like the present incident, which was an open secret.
Judge Gill remarked, “In any civilised society, attacks on the police, military installations, defence buildings, national monuments, or road blockades are considered acts of highhandedness and lawlessness.”
The judge noted that in all the May 9
incidents
, only military and official buildings and installations were targeted by the attackers across Pakistan.
In Lahore, the road from Sherpao Bridge to Jinnah House was especially targeted, being located in the cantonment area.
He noted that in none of the incidents was any private building or property damaged.
“So, naturally, police officials are the best witnesses to testify about the true facts and what actually happened. It is also understandable that no private witnesses were available or willing to testify, as many of them were found to be involved in the incident,” the judge observed.
The judge stated that it is now well established in various judgements of the superior courts that police officials are as credible as private witnesses, unless bias can be proven.
Regarding the four PTI leaders, excluding Mr Qureshi, the judge maintained that there was no doubt that meetings—during which the
conspiracy
was allegedly hatched—were convened at Zaman Park, the residence of incarcerated PTI founding chairman Imran Khan.
The judge said it was normal for the accused, being part of the senior leadership of the PTI, to remain in contact with their then chairman (Imran Khan) and to follow his directions.
He concluded that the prosecution witnesses provided an uninterrupted chain of facts regarding the commission of the offence, including arrest, identification parades, recoveries, and digital evidence (social media accounts, press clippings, news channel reports, and social media footage), covering all aspects of the case.
Mr Qureshi was acquitted after successfully proving that he was neither present at the Zaman Park meetings nor in Lahore on the day of the incident.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943495/law-enforced-to-protect-medics-from-violence-in-kp-hospitals,Law enforced to protect medics from violence in KP hospitals - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has promulgated the long-awaited law to ensure protection of healthcare workers against violence during their duty hours as well as patients’ rights and confidentiality during treatment in hospitals.
A notification issued by Dr Shahid Yunis, the director general of health services, ordered regional directors, district health officers, medical superintendents and medical teaching institutions to comply with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Healthcare Service Providers and Facilities (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property)
Act
, 2020, to safeguard healthcare service providers, patients and establishments against unlawful activities disrupting healthcare services.
They have been instructed that the Act should be widely circulated to all healthcare facilities across the province to report incidents of violence, damage to property or disruption of healthcare services to the coordination section at directorate general health services, Peshawar, for immediate enforcement of the law.
The notification has also sought details about number of incidents and FIRs lodged with police to ensure strict compliance of the law in their respective jurisdictions and further dissemination to health facilities for information and implementation.
The Act also safeguards rights of patients
A separate notification, issued by Health Secretary Shahidullah Khan, asked directorate-general health services to consolidate the information and furnish it to health department for record, monitoring and further necessary action.
Officials, meanwhile, said that the same law was passed by provincial assembly in 2020 but it remained in limbo despite demands by healthcare workers for its enforcement.
Healthcare providers have been observing strikes against non-enforcement of the law to protect them against violence by people in hospitals.
Officials working on the implementation of the law said that incidents of violence prompted health department to come with a law to give protection to health workers so that patients could get unhindered treatment.
Under the law, the violators would face a heavy fine and jail term.
Under section-3 of the law, any act of violence against healthcare providers or damage to property in a healthcare service institution is punishable.
Anyone, who commits any act in contravention of it, will be punished with imprisonment of three years along with a fine of up to Rs50,000.
Its sub-section-1 says that the offender shall be liable to pay to a healthcare service institution a compensation double of the amount of purchase price of medical equipment damaged and the loss caused to the property as may be determined by the court trying the offence.
If the offender does not pay the compensation under sub-section-2, the said sum shall be recovered as if it is an arrear of land revenue due from him. Any offence committed under section 3 shall be cognisable and non-bailable, it says.
Besides providing protection to healthcare providers, the law also makes it binding on healthcare institutions to give complete information of medical treatment to patients.
It shall be the responsibility of each healthcare service institution to furnish, in writing, complete information about medical treatment provided by such healthcare service institutions, to the patients, who seek treatment in the said institutions or to their designated relatives, says the law.
Health professionals have appreciated the department for enforcement of the law. On September 10, a row between the staffers of TB control programme and
Hayatabad
Medical Complex led to physical bouts between them and subsequent strikes that prompted the health department to implement the law.
Provincial Doctors, Association, Young Doctors Association, Malgari Doctoran and Insaf Doctors Forum have appreciated the government’s decision to implement the law, saying it will protect doctors as well as the patients against violence.
Under the law, patients have the right to seek complete record of their treatment while those resorting to violence against health workers will face legal action.
Officials said that health sector reforms unit (HSRU) was working to frame rules that would give an end to strikes and protests by health workers.
The department had finalised the law with input from Khyber Medical University after collection of data regarding violence from different hospitals in the country, they said.

The USSM, based in the state of Missouri, is focused on producing and recycling critical minerals, which the United States Department of Energy has defined as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.
The USSM is a company that specialises in extracting critical metals from old lithium-ion batteries and mining cobalt, nickel and copper, according to its
website
. According to the American embassy, the US Department of Energy has defined critical minerals as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.
A
press release
from the US Embassy, published on Sunday, stated that Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Zach Harkenrider accompanied a USSM-led delegation to sign an MoU with the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) at the Prime Minister’s House.
Speaking about the MoU signing, US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker said, “This signing is yet another example of the strength of the US-Pakistan bilateral relationship that will benefit both countries.”
Speaking about the importance of such bilateral agreements, Baker said that US President Donald Trump’s administration has made forging such deals a key priority, based on the importance of critical mineral resources to American security and prosperity.
“We look forward to seeing future agreements between US companies and their counterparts in the critical minerals and mining sector in Pakistan.”
A statement from the PM House said that the USSM delegation is visiting  Pakistan to explore opportunities for expanding the country’s mining operations and assessing the potential for value addition in mineral resources and the development of supporting infrastructure.
“[The] delegation held high-level meetings with [the] prime minister of Pakistan, chief of army staff, minister of petroleum and minister of commerce and were briefed on Pakistan’s vast mineral reserves, including copper, gold, and rare earth elements,” the statement read.
“In this context, two Memoranda of Understanding, focusing on [the] development and processing of critical minerals, including rare earth elements (REEs), and logistics services, were signed.”
The second MoU was signed between the National Logistics Corporation of Pakistan and Mota-Engil Group, a global leader in engineering and construction.
“The current survey of opportunities in Pakistan aims to identify priority markets where Mota-Engil can align with government visions and private sector initiatives. The group seeks to build long-term partnerships that leverage its global know-how while creating value locally through job creation, technology transfer, and sustainable development.”
According to the statement, the partnership will begin immediately with the export of readily available minerals from Pakistan, including antimony, copper, gold, tungsten and REEs.
“The first phase of this deal is envisaged at approximately $500m of investments into Pakistans critical minerals sector,” the statement read.
Pakistan’s relations with the US have been improving, with both nations recently signing trade deals. Islamabad successfully
negotiated
a reduction in reciprocal tariffs — from 29 per cent to 19pc — after the two nations concluded a trade deal in July.
This was after Trump announced that the US had concluded a
deal
with Islamabad that would allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan’s vast oil reserves.
In April this year, a senior US official had
underscored
Washington’s strategic interest in Pakistan’s
mineral
sector, signalling a push for long-term cooperation in the development of critical mineral resources key to American advanced technologies.
“Critical minerals are the raw materials necessary for our most advanced technologies,” Eric Meyer, senior bureau official for the Department of State’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, was quoted in a statement issued by the US embassy in Islamabad on his visit.",2025-09-08,Abdullah Momand,1033,0.000137

Pakistan Airlines will deliver the mail to Doha, and then Qatar Post will dispatch it to its final destination through its network.
A senior official of the Directorate of Pakistan Post told
Dawn
that Etihad Airways suspended the uplift of all categories of international mail from September 1 because Pakistan Post had failed to pay its outstanding dues exceeding Rs200 million for transporting the mail.
He mentioned that only Pakistan International Airlines was currently handling the international mail in countries where its flights operate. However, he added that over 6,000 letters and parcels had been pending for the past two weeks as the private airline refused to transport them.

He explained that the matter had been reported to the federal government, which decided to seek assistance from Qatar Post to deliver the mail through its system in countries where PIA does not operate.
To resolve this issue, he further noted that discussions were held with Qatar Post to forward Pakistan Post’s mail via Doha. The additional director of operations at Pakistan Post, who was in the UAE for the Council of Administration (CA) and Postal Operational Council (POC) sessions, also held a meeting with his Qatar counterpart to reinforce this request.
He expressed that Qatar Post has now agreed to offer its Closed Transit Service to Pakistan Post.
When contacted, Pakistan Post Director Abid Mehmood stated that the mail service between Pakistan and Qatar has resumed, and Pakistan Post will now deliver letters, parcels, and other mail through Qatar Post.
He explained that due to financial constraints, Pakistan Post was unable to pay the outstanding dues to private airlines, and the finance ministry had been asked for a bailout package to prevent future issues.
He further mentioned that following the agreement between Pakistan Post and Qatar Post, all categories of mail, letters, parcels, and EMS will be sent to Doha in closed transit via PIA flights, after which Qatar Post will forward consignments to their final destinations through its partner airlines.
On the topic of mail delivery to the United States of America, Mr Mehmood said that under the new tax regime, letters and parcels had been suspended, but new regulations have been issued.

He said PTI Kisan Wing will not leave the farmers alone in this hour of difficulty and in addition to providing all possible assistance to compensate for their losses, their problems will be highlighted on the floor of the parliament.
“In this regard, Kisan Wing Organiser Sheikh Waqas Akram, MNA, will compile a detailed report regarding destruction of crops and present it to PTI founder Imran Khan,” he said.
Meanwhile, the PTI leadership has offered condolences to all those families whose loved-ones died in the recent floods. The PTI leadership also expressed deep sympathy with them for the loss of their livestock, houses and crops.
It said that full assistance will be provided to flood victims in KP and for this purpose data is being compiled.

(Right) Agitating employees hold a sit-in on press club road in Hyderabad.—Dawn
SUKKUR/LARKANA/HYDERABAD: Thou­sands of patients had to suffer agonising disruption in their treatment at almost all government healthcare facilities, including major hospitals, on Monday as Sindh government employees prolonged their strike over newly introduced
pension reforms
.
The
strike
, observed on a call given by the Sindh Employees Alliance (SEA) for Sept 23-27, continued on Monday without any formal announcement.
Labour leaders address­ing participants of different rallies, demonstrations and sit-ins held in all cities and towns of the province told the audience that the strike was being prolonged due to Sindh government’s indifference towards their sustained struggle and even the five-day strike.
The SEA had on Saturday declared end to the strike on Saturday as per the original schedule and announced that in the next phase, a sit-in would be held outside Bilawal House in Karachi on October 6 if its demands were not met by then.
Health, education, revenue and over 35 other departments stay shut for a seventh consecutive day over pension reforms
Patients and their attendants at all government hospitals and healthcare units were seen desperately seeking doctors’ advice and treatment but in vain due to absence of doctors, paramedics and other staff at OPDs. Only emergency services were available at these facilities.
Departments stay shut
More than 40 departments, including health, education and revenue, remained shut across Sindh for a seventh consecutive day causing immense problems to millions of people seeking official services.
At each department, scores of people, including those coming from far flung areas, were seen being turned back by striking employees present outside their locked offices.
At Sukkur Civil Hospital, patients and attendants of in-house patients were seen waiting outside the locked OPDs and begging doctors and paramedics to spare a few minutes to give their advice. But they were denied any help.
The number of patients visiting the hospital along with their attendants rain into hundreds by the evening.
The agitating employees held a demonstration on the hospital’s premises and kept raising slogans against pension reforms and the ruling party’s indifference towards their plight.
They vowed to continue the strike until their demands were met.
In Larkana, a complete lockout of hospitals, universities, colleges, schools and departments was observed on Monday on SEA’s call.
The alliance’s main demands are withdrawal of the ‘black law’ pertaining to pension and the release of the
Disparity Reduction Allowance
(DRA).
Male and female doctors, paramedics, officers, clerks and other employees wore black armbands and held a sit-in for four hours in the scorching heat in front of the Larkana Press Club. They carried banners and placards inscribed with their demands and kept raising slogans.
The SEA strike is supported by Government Secondary Teachers Association, Primary Teachers Association, APCA Sindh, Gazetted Officers Association, Sindh Professors and Lecturers Association (Sukkur region), Highways CBA, All Universities Employees Association, Pakistan Paramedical Staff Association, Pakistan Medical Association, (Hyderabad) and many other organisations.
SPLA rejects pension reforms
The central executive meeting of the Sindh Professors and Lecturers  Association (SPLA) decided to reject the Sindh government’s pension reforms and announced full support for the Sindh Employees Alliance in  their demand to withdraw the so-called reforms.
This was decided in a meeting held on Monday at Government Degree Boys College, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, under the chairmanship of the central president of SPLA, Professor Munawar Abbas.
It was decided to take legal action against the freezing of house rent, conveyance allowance and medical allowance and stressed that the same be increased in line with inflation.
PTI submits resolution in PA
The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Sindh, on Monday  threw its weight behind the ongoing protest of government employees,  with its lawmaker Sajad Ali Soomro tabling a resolution in the Sindh Assembly demanding immediate withdrawal of pension reforms.
The resolution stated that the provincial government had attempted to deprive employees of their economic rights under the guise of reforms. It described the move as  ‘economic murder’ of employees and urged the government to address their legitimate demands without delay.
The resolution warned that depriving employees of their pension was tantamount to ‘robbery of rights’ and an ‘act of sheer injustice’. It said government servants depend on pension for their livelihood after retirement, and stripping them of this facility was unacceptable.
Highlighting the impact of the ongoing strike, the PTI lawmaker said  educational institutions across the province had been closed for a  week, placing students’ future at serious risk. He cautioned that further closures would not only affect education but also disrupt wider public services.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941705,SMOKERS’ CORNER: THE HYBRID JUDICIARY - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"The Supreme Court’s Senior Puisne Judge,
Justice Mansoor Ali Shah
, and Islamabad High Court’s
Justice Babar Sattar
have been writing letters to the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), Yahya Afridi. Justice Shah and Justice Sattar have often complained that the CJP has avoided addressing institutional concerns raised by them.
Then there’s the Supreme Court’s
Justice Athar Minallah
, who has been delivering lectures on ‘judicial independence’ and how the current ‘hybrid regime’ in Pakistan is detrimental to democracy.
As far as Justice Shah and, especially, Justice Minallah are concerned, there is enough in their judicial pasts that their detractors often dig out to make the current dispositions of these judges sound contradictory. But this article is not about that. It is about how the ongoing tensions between prominent judges in the country are a culmination of years of ‘
judicialisation
’.
Judicialisation refers to a condition in which the influence of the courts spills into political and policy-making spheres, or when important public and political matters are largely addressed by the courts. Eventually, the courts begin to intervene in matters that are the domain of politicians and administrators. The political weight of the judges and courts grows at the expense of politicians. This erodes the authority of the elected branches of government.
When the current ‘hybrid set-up’ in Pakistan formed a ‘
Constitutional Bench
’ through a constitutional amendment, it justified the move as a means to check the encroachment of the courts in political matters. However, some senior judges, opposition parties and segments of the media saw this as a way to curb the influence of ‘independent-minded judges.’ But according to the government, these judges had become ‘politicised’.
Years of ‘judicialisation’ have expanded courts’ role far beyond adjudication in Pakistan. Letters, lectures and public spats among senior judges now expose how judicial activism, once hailed as judicial independence, risks becoming politicisation and self-aggrandisement
According to the researcher Bakht Munir, the most common form of judicialisation in Pakistan has been the “judicialisation of politics.” This is when judicial verdicts begin to have a decisive impact on a country’s politics. According to Munir, judicialisation of politics in Pakistan has often been about the judiciary working closely with the ‘establishment’ against elected governments.
For decades, this form of judicialisation has had a history of legitimising martial laws, and dismissing prime ministers. Munir calls this the “judicialisation of regime change.” But he adds that, after the riotous
‘Lawyers’ Movement’
in 2007 — which forced the reinstatement of ‘popular’ CJP Iftikhar Chaudhry who had been dismissed by the dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf — the judicialisation of politics transformed and became the “
politicisation of the judiciary
.”
Due to the overtly political nature of the Lawyers’ Movement, the judiciary transmuted its role and began to directly interfere in political matters (without necessarily being encouraged to do so by the establishment). This form of judicialisation often includes ‘
judicial activism
’ and ‘
judicial populism
.’ The removal of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani in 2011 by the then CJP Iftikhar Chaudhry, and Chaudhry’s verdicts against certain major government policies, are examples of how judicial activism can override legislation and acts of the chief executive.
With the rise of
populist politics in Pakistan
from 2011 onwards, and especially after 2014, the judicial activism of the Chaudhry era mutated and then merged with old-school judicialisation, when the military establishment (ME) began to shape a new political force in the shape of Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). This, allegedly, saw certain senior judges become part of the ‘Imran Khan Project’ and match the project’s populist nature with an increased show of judicial populism.
This was most visible during Justice Saqib Nisar’s tenure as CJP (2016-2019). The controversial
dismissal of PM Nawaz Sharif
in 2017 by the courts can be seen as an outcome of the merger of the politicisation of the judiciary and old-school ME-backed judicialisation of politics. In some cases, right until the tenure of
CJP Justice Umer Atta Bandial
(2022-2023), the judiciary went beyond the confines of petitions, by allowing its personal views to influence decisions.
Interestingly, some segments of civil society, the lawyers’ community and the media view the politicisation of the judiciary and judicial activism as expressions of judicial independence. However, their detractors see judges such as Justice Shah, Justice Minallah and Justice Sattar as leftovers of the highly populist variant of judicialisation that mushroomed during the now-receding era of political populism in Pakistan (2011-2022).
It was an era in which the judiciary indulged in political intervention and policy-driven judicial activism. This included the problematic interpretation of Article 63-A of the constitution, surprise judicial hospital visits, the judicial push for the construction of a dam and the regulation of its fund, disqualification of politicians
under Article 62 (1) (f)
, and the conviction of former PMs Gilani and Nawaz Sharif.
This raised questions about the integrity and working mechanisms of the judiciary as an institution. The practice of including ‘like-minded’ judges in the constitution of the benches, too, triggered questions about the judiciary’s institutional structure, giving the impression of partiality and favouritism.
According to Professor of Law John Ferejohn, judicialisation imposes substantive limits on parliament’s legislative authority, intruding into the formulation of substantive policymaking. To another professor of law, Muhammad Fahd Amin, through judicialisation, the judiciary establishes its authority as a key player in a country’s politics. This is something the former CJP Qazi Faez Isa tried to address, but he was mercilessly pelted with scathing criticism by those who viewed him to be “too technical” and not “empathetic enough.”
According to the framers of the
26th Amendment
in Pakistan’s Constitution — through which a Constitutional Bench of ‘neutral judges’ was formed — this was done to curb the politicisation of the judiciary and judicial activism. It is still too early, though, to comment on the validity of this narrative. But some journalists/vloggers, opposition politicians and activists are fixated on viewing judicial activism as a form of judicial independence and a “struggle for democracy.”
Bakht Munir has a rather interesting take on all this. He wrote that the current form of judicialisation in Pakistan among certain judges is neither forced by political circumstances nor compelled by public opinion. According to Munir, the judicial activism of these judges is driven by “self-proclaimed authority on the pretext of matters of national significance, despite increasing criticism from various quarters and weak jurisdictional justifications.”
During the politicisation of the judiciary and the resultant judicial activism/populism of the last decade, the judiciary desired that its interferences be broadly publicised in the media and celebrated. Munir saw this as “a tool for self-glorification.”

In response, the PM Office constituted the committee to probe the matter and fix responsibility. The complaint was also forwarded to the Deputy Commissioner’s Office, which was asked to investigate.
The DC Office initiated the inquiry, while the police also began investigations.
Preliminary findings suggested that the expatriate, a retired bureaucrat currently affiliated with the World Bank and residing in the US, owned the land. His father had purchased 137 kanals in the capital’s rural area in 2002 and he held ownership, possession and entitlement to it.
During his recent visit to Islamabad, he found private security guards deployed on his land and discovered that it had been occupied by another party. He also found that cattle he owned and kept on the property had disappeared.
The expatriate had appointed a manager to look after the land in his absence and had issued him a power of attorney to represent him in case of litigation. However, the power of attorney was limited to legal matters only.
It was later discovered that the manager, in connivance with a land provider/middleman and a few officials of the Revenue Registry Branch, had altered the last page of the power of attorney, granting the manager the power to sell the land.
Using the forged document, the two sold the property through separate transactions amounting to Rs390 million in pay orders and cash, despite the land’s actual worth being Rs190m.
It is suspected that some officials of the Revenue Registry Branch are also involved in the matter.
The committee, headed by the deputy commissioner, is likely to submit its report to the PM Office soon.
Meanwhile, the capital police have registered a case regarding the cattle theft.
Further legal action, including registration of additional cases, will be taken in light of the inquiry report and directives issued by the PM Office.

Overtopping and changed course of the river at different places caused flooding in villages and farmlands.
According to a report reaching here in the evening, deluges cut off road links between 90 villages and inundated many other pucca roads in the two districts.
Men, women and children were seen moving away from their heavily flooded villages to reach any dry place coming on their way.
Deluges hit urban areas, schools and health facilities
Water level in the Indus was constantly rising at Sehwan and Manjhand and, according to a rough estimate, the discharge there was around 470,000 cusecs.
According to sources in the area, over 80 villages across Sehwan and Man­jhand talukas have come under floodwater and people were facing great hardship in continuing their routine activities.
In Manjhand, a historic temple and nearby railway tracks were submerged. The tracks at Laki Shah Sadar and Amri were also inundated.
A privately raised dyke near Manzoorabad eroded due to immense pressure of floodwater. Gushing deluge was moving towards the populated areas with full force.
The road leading to Budhapur had come under deep water severely affecting movement of local residents.
In Sehwan taluka, five more villages — Long Khan, Sadiq Sahto, Amin Shahani, Lal Bakhsh Laghari, and Kacha Radhan — were hit by floodwater bringing the number of affected villages to over 20.
Four other villages in the Petaro area were also hit by flowing discharges restricting local residents to their homes.
In both Sehwan and Manhand talukas, about 15 government schools and eight health facilities were hit by severe flooding making them to stop functioning.
The Larkana-Sehwan Bund is said to be under immense pressure floodwater. Deluges have also hit the Sehwan-Hyder­abad section of the Indus Highway at Bhagotoro.
Former MNA Sardar Sikandar Ali Rahopoto visited the Chhachhar Loop Bund near Amri on Monday to assess the situation.
He reviewed the strengthening work and received a briefed from the officials concerned at the site.
“A new dyke is being constructed ahead of the Laki Shah Sadar to supplement the Amri Loop Bund strength,” he said.
The Sindh government was taking all possible measures to ensure public safety and control the floodwater, he added.
Irrigation officials were also present during the former MNA’s visit.

The Housing Directorate of CDA, through an official letter, revoked the revised layout plan of the CBR housing society located in Zone-5 of Islamabad.
The letter, dated September 1, referred to Islamabad High Court orders issued last year, stating: “The impugned revised layout plan dated 21-03-2023 passed by CDA is declared illegal, without lawful authority, and of no legal effect, and is hereby set aside. The respondents are directed to restore the layout plan of CBR Phase-I to its original form as approved on 24-02-2007. CDA is further directed to ensure that no amenity plots, green areas, or public utility spaces are converted to residential or commercial use in violation of applicable laws and regulations, and that the rights of residents are safeguarded in future with no orders as to costs,” the letter read.
“In view of the foregoing, the revised and extended layout plan of CBR Employees Cooperative Housing Society approved by CDA, dated 21-03-2023, is hereby withdrawn and cancelled with immediate effect. The layout plan of Phase I dated 24-02-2007, is restored,” the letter added, declaring the planning and development beyond the 2007 approved layout illegal.
Notice issued to Multi-Garden Housing Scheme for illegal conversion of amenity plots
The CDA directed the CBR society to submit a revised layout plan for the extended areas within 15 days.
Meanwhile, CDA issued a notice to the Multi Garden Housing Society regarding the illegal conversion of public amenity plots transferred in the name of CDA in Sector A-17/B-17, Zone 2, sponsored by Multi Professional Cooperative Housing Scheme.
According to the letter, the layout plan of this scheme was approved by CDA in 2006, subject to conditions. In 2007, land designated for roads, parks, graveyards, and public buildings was officially transferred to the CDA through a transfer deed.
Subsequently, the NOC was issued by CDA. Later, a revised layout plan was approved by CDA in 2022, again with terms and conditions.
However, the operator of the society has failed to obtain the NOC after three years.
“It has been observed with grave concerns and viewed seriously that the sponsor of society has violated the approved layout plan and illegally converted the sites reserved for parks, graveyard and public building transferred in the name of CDA,” read the letter.
It also stated that 300 feet east of the 17th series of sectors is reserved for the right-of-way of 18th avenue, and this right-of-way was also reserved in the layout plan.
“But it has been observed with grave concerns that some illegal and unauthorised development and construction works in the shape of grid station, zoo, site office, medical centre, residential houses etc has/is being made within the 300 feet ROW of 18th amendment,” read the letter and stated that CDA provides a chance of personal hearing to operator of this scheme within 10 days.

Every year, many young Pakistanis leave the country via illegal routes in hopes of better employment opportunities. A 2023
study
by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the European Union (EU) found that 24,000 Pakistanis entered EU countries illegally over the past three years.
The network, called — Pakistan United Nations Network on Migration (UNNM) — was inaugurated at a ceremony in Islamabad and aims to develop a “unified, collaborative approach to migration governance”, the press release said.
The UNNM will focus on “responding to the interconnected challenges of human trafficking and migrant smuggling” within international frameworks such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SDGs) and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM).
The
GCM
is “the first intergovernmental agreement to cover all dimensions of international migration,” according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
In light of the network, Pakistan’s first Migration Multi-Partner Trust Fund programme (MMPTF) was formed, with special emphasis on combating Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants in Pakistan.
The IOM describes Trafficking in Persons as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion.”
While Smuggling of Migrants means “materially profiting by procuring another person’s illegal border crossing”, according to the IOM.
Established to support the implementation of GCM, the initiative will be run “jointly by IOM and UNODC in collaboration with the Government of Pakistan, the private sector, the media, and civil society,” the press release said.
Speaking at the ceremony, UN Resident Coordinator Mohamed Yahya, who was also the host of the event, said, “The establishment of this network is a testament to our collective resolve to ensure that migration is safe, orderly, and regular.”
Mohamed Yahya was appointed as the network’s chair.
He went on to say that the establishment of a network “provides a crucial platform to shift the narrative on migration, amplify a unified voice, and foster the innovation needed to address complex challenges related to mobility and protecting the rights of all people on the move”.
As per the press release, the MMPTF will employ a “whole of government” and “a whole of society” approach to tackle human trafficking, migrant smuggling, and improve the methods of migration governance.
“Life makes us move. But journeys, either from our home to new destinations or back to our country, should become easier, more dignified,” said Moazzam Ali, a Pakistani migrant who voluntarily returned to Pakistan from Romania.
“The network will leverage partnerships across the UN system to promote policy coherence and integrate migration policies into the broader development goals,” the press release added.
Head of the UN Migration Network Secretariat Jonathan Prentice, who joined the meeting via video, congratulated Pakistan on playing a role in the “global collective to help improve migration governance in the world”.
The ceremony featured a panel discussion as well, titled — ‘Enhancing whole-of-government migration governance in the age of complex mobility dynamics and emerging global challenges’ — with panellists including representatives from governmental departments.",2025-09-01,Nadir Guramani,894,0.000127
https://www.dawn.com/news/1941948/israeli-strikes-on-doha-have-shattered-us-credibility-where-do-gulf-states-go-from-here,Israeli strikes on Doha have shattered US credibility. Where do Gulf states go from here? - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Israel’s
recent strike in Doha
crossed a line Gulf leaders had long assumed was sacrosanct: that Gulf capitals were under the American security umbrella and hence outside the operational zone of the Gaza conflict .
Not anymore. Gulf states are now grappling with a new reality: a risk-acceptant Israel willing to reorder the wider Middle East — even at the expense of US allies in the Gulf.
For Gulf leaders, the American inability to restrain Israel is perplexing. More fundamentally, a question looms: can they still trust the US security umbrella in a fracturing region?
Some allies more important than others
As a shocked Qatari leadership processed the strike, it looked to Washington and its Gulf partners for support. The US, meanwhile, issued only a
mild rebuke of Israel
for hitting another close ally that hosts the region’s largest US base, Al Udeid, home to CENTCOM’s regional headquarters. President Trump
promised deeper defence cooperation
with Qatar and
claimed Doha was given last-minute notice
of the strike. Qatar pushed back, terming the notification too late. Trump’s remarks dragged Doha into politically uncharted waters, forcing it to reassert its credibility as a reliable mediator.
For Qatar, the image of the country as a diplomatic mediator has become the lynchpin of its foreign policy in recent years. Israel’s strike on Hamas leaders in Doha struck at the very core of that strategy, shattering the perception of Qatar as a
safe and neutral venue for dialogue
between belligerents.
For Doha, its role as a trusted broker — backed by US support — has been central to expanding its diplomatic relevance with major powers and securing credibility in international forums. This mediation brand is not symbolic; it is Qatar’s primary tool for offsetting its geographic vulnerability and amplifying its influence in a region where it is dominated by larger neighbours such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Yet, now Qatar is looking up to these very regional neighbours to chart a regional response to Israeli aggression.
Realising the gravity of the moment, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, the regional heavyweights, moved swiftly, framing the strikes as a challenge to ‘collective Gulf security’, not just Qatari sovereignty. This aligns with Article 2 of the ‘Joint Defence Agreement’ of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which states: “any attack on any of them is an attack on all of them and any threat to one of them is a threat to all of them”.
The real dilemma now is: how to treat an Israeli strike on Qatar as an attack on GCC states, without jeopardising their security cooperation with the US, which was meant to protect them in the first place? An uncomfortable truth is now evident for Gulf states: for the US, some allies matter more than others.
What next for the GCC?
At this point, expressions of solidarity and condemnation are simply not enough. Israel will not be deterred by statements alone, knowing Riyadh and Abu Dhabi remain constrained by their dependence on the US security architecture. Despite their show of support, recent history of
Qatar’s tense ties with both the UAE and KSA
also weighs on the collective response.
For now, Israel’s reckless behaviour of even attacking those regional neighbours who are facilitating mediation to end the war is hurting the decades-long US security pact with the Gulf states. Among the GCC states, Washington had found a pragmatic partner in Doha, and that collaboration had delivered results in recent years. However, due to Israel’s unhinged risk-taking, both the GCC and the US are now scrambling to restore the credibility of their security cooperation.
The challenge is most acute for Qatar, which must simultaneously restore its security and its standing as a mediator. Within days, Doha moved from mediator to victim.
Drawing on its experience of
mediating between the US and the Taliban
to end the Afghan conflict, Doha had assumed that Tel Aviv would not strike the very mediator facilitating the only channel linking Hamas, Israel, and Washington.
Qatar’s immediate priority is to raise the reputational cost of any repeat strike while hardening security around negotiations. It is leaning on Washington to restrain Tel Aviv, while underscoring the critical nature of the Doha channel. But trust is absent when Israel appears committed to a military-only path. Beyond mediation, Gulf states, especially Qatar, will now demand firmer guardrails against Israeli aggression and clearer red lines for operations on Gulf soil.
Alternatives to US guarantees do not exist in the short term: Chinese or Russian security patronage is neither feasible nor desirable, and even a regional security architecture involving Egypt, Turkey, or Pakistan cannot function without US assent and participation.
Crucially, the US umbrella was never designed to deter strikes from Israel — a crucial US ally — on Gulf territory. To adapt, Gulf states must develop defensive capabilities outside the US framework while deepening cooperation with regional partners. Early-warning and missile-defence systems from European and Asian suppliers could provide a ring-fence of protection, creating a semi-autonomous shield.
The Doha strike is more than a breach of sovereignty: it is a stress test for the entire Gulf security order. Outrage without deterrence is noise, and the Gulf cannot afford noise.
The signals from the Gulf must be concrete: tighter airspace control, joint threat alerts, and a quiet understanding that any actor striking inside GCC territory forfeits access to Qatar-hosted mediation.
For Washington, the credibility gap is real. If the US cannot restrain an ally from striking another ally’s capital during US-brokered talks, its security protection is not credible anymore. Finally, as the Gulf ponders a regional diplomatic response to avoid becoming next battle space, Qatar faces its own decisive moment: to host, or not to host?

Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain on Monday held detailed discussions with a delegation of the Chinese Academy to discuss transformation of PARC.
The Chinese team shared their experience of successfully transforming CAAS nearly two decades ago and offered valuable insights into PARC’s reform process.
They identified financial constraints, limited incentives for scientists, and restricted international collaborations as key hurdles for PARC.
They stressed the need for a competitive model supported by long-term investment and stronger collaboration with the private sector and international partners.
Chinese team cites financial constraints, limited international collaboration as key hurdles for the council
Mr Hussain reiterated that reforming PARC is a national priority and assured the government’s complete support to expedite the process, and expressed confidence that with China’s partnership and Pakistan’s commitment, PARC will emerge as a strong and modern research institution capable of delivering innovative solutions, enhancing agricultural productivity and securing the country’s food future.
The Chinese delegation was led by Ms Yan, Consultant at the Department of International Cooperation of the Chinese ministry of agriculture and rural affairs.
She was accompanied by Ms Long Wanrong, Consultant, Department of Personnel, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. She also serves as professor and director at the Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, CAAS.
Senior experts Prof Jia Yaxiong, Director, Division of Science and Technology Management, Institute of Animal Sciences, CAAS, was also included in the delegation.
Speaking to the Chinese delegation, Mr Hussain stressed that agricultural research must be directly aligned with the needs of farmers and industry, ensuring that scientific innovations are translated into practical solutions that contribute to food security and economic growth.
He emphasised that the transformation roadmap for PARC must include clear timelines, measurable outcomes, and sustainable investment mechanisms. The minister also underlined the importance of rewarding scientists for their innovations, noting that talent retention requires an incentive structure linked to commercialisation of research.
The minister welcomed the proposal for reciprocal visits and exchange programmes between PARC and CAAS, stressing that Pakistani scientists must benefit from firsthand exposure to CAAS’s research model. He further noted that the MoU signed earlier between PARC and CAAS will now be operationalised to give concrete shape to joint efforts.
The Chinese delegation also visited PARC and during meeting with agricultural experts, expressed strong support for future cooperation between CAAS and PARC.
“We are committed to continuing our support for Pakistan’s agricultural advancement. Strengthening this partnership will be critical for ensuring food and nutritional security in both countries,” the head of Chinese delegation said.
Secretary of National Food Security and Research, Amir Mohyuddin while discussing Pak-China collaboration in the agricultural sector, emphasised the critical role of innovation and international collaboration in shaping the future of agriculture in Pakistan.
“The challenges we face — climate change, water scarcity, declining soil fertility, and a rapidly growing population — require science-driven, innovative solutions. International collaboration, particularly with China, offers Pakistan a historic opportunity to modernise agriculture and strengthen food security,” he said.
During discussions, PARC Chairman Dr Syed Hassan Andrabi said that despite limited resources, PARC continues to play a pivotal role in boosting the national economy through research and innovation.
“We see immense potential in joint ventures with China to address mutual challenges, particularly in climate change adaptation, food insecurity, and sustainable production systems,” he stated.
Dr Andrabi proposed the establishment of Centre of Excellence at PARC — National Agricultural Research Centre (NARC) on CAAS model, focused on high-impact research for food security, climate-resilient technologies, and sustainable agricultural development.
This visit marks a renewed chapter in China-Pakistan agricultural cooperation, where innovation, technology transfer, and sustainable practices will form the foundation of a shared future.
The proposed Centre of Excellence at NARC is expected to serve as a flagship project under this collaboration, showcasing China-Pakistan agricultural friendship as a model for the region.

The direction came after the federal government transferred Rs5 million into the account of Abdullah’s family. During the hearing, Additional Attorney General and officials of the defence ministry presented the receipt of the online transfer before the court.
Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, while addressing the victim’s father, remarked that the family would receive the money by tomorrow, but added that compensation could not heal the trauma caused by enforced disappearances. “This money cannot cure the family’s suffering,” the judge observed.
He further warned that the matter could lead to criminal proceedings at any stage, criticising parliament for its silence on the issue.
“This is the work of parliament, but unfortunately they have closed their eyes,” he remarked.
Justice Kayani stressed that the court wanted only the truth about Abdullah’s fate. “We should be told whether the missing citizen is alive, dead, or in an Afghan jail. Officers should just come with the record and inform the court of the facts — we are not writing anyone’s name in the verdict,” he said.
The judge noted that intelligence officers regularly appeared before the Missing Persons Commission but expressed reluctance when summoned by courts. “I do not know why they get so angry with the court while the same officers appear before a retired judge in the commission,” he added.
He further observed that financial settlements could not resolve the longstanding issue of enforced disappearances.
“The state does not have a shortage of money, but the problem will not be solved by paying money.
The court should be informed whether the person was killed, left the country or is hiding somewhere,” Justice Kayani remarked.
Lamenting the lack of progress over the past decade, the judge said no authority had so far provided the courts with the truth.
“Brigadier Sahib! We cannot tear up judgments, you have to tell us where the missing person is,” he said, while reminding the defence ministry’s representative that the family was not at fault and everything should be handled in accordance with the law to maintain public trust.
The court adjourned the hearing until Oct 6, directing the ministry to inform it beforehand which officer would appear for the in-camera briefing.

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir were also present in the “warm and cordial” meeting, the PID statement said.
“The prime minister stressed that Israel’s aggression in the Middle East must be stopped immediately, and unity within the ummah was vitally important, in the face of repeated Israeli provocations,” the press release said.
PM Shehbaz “deeply appreciated” Qatar’s decision to convene the emergency Arab-Islamic summit, which the Foreign Office
said
was co-sponsored by Pakistan.
The premier further recalled that at Qatar’s request, Pakistan had sought an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the “deteriorating situation in the Middle East”. Pakistan took centre stage at that summit as its envoy and Israeli ambassador
traded barbs
while major powers
censured Tel Aviv
over its attack on Doha.
The Qatari emir, as per the PID, expressed appreciation for PM Shehbaz’s participation in the Arab-Islamic summit as well as for his
one-day visit
to Doha last week to “express solidarity with Qatar at this difficult time”.
“Both leaders agreed to remain in close contact in view of the unfolding situation in the region,” the press release added.
PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s “strongest condemnation of the Israeli strike on a residential area in Doha on September 9, that led to the loss of precious lives and injured several others”. Hamas said that
five of its members
were killed in the attack, including the son of Hamas’s exiled Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya. A Qatari security official was also killed in the strike.
Recalling his last week’s meeting with the Qatari emir — which took place two days after the attack — the premier “emphasised, once again, that Pakistan and Qatar’s fraternal ties were historic, longstanding and abiding and they would grow stronger in the coming days”.
Meetings with other Mideast key players
Yesterday, on the sidelines of the Arab-Islamic summit, PM Shehbaz held a bilateral meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, during which Dar and COAS Munir were also present.
The prime minister also met Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi and appreciated the latter’s “proactive diplomacy at this difficult juncture”, the government said on X.
Both leaders termed the violation of Qatar’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity by Israel as reckless and a blatant violation of international law”.
In his meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein, PM Shehbaz “lauded King Abdullah II’s steadfast leadership on the Palestinian cause”, the government’s official X account said.
“The two leaders underscored the urgency of Muslim unity in confronting Israel’s belligerent actions and agreed to continue close consultations to mobilise international support for peace and stability in the region,” it added.
Addressing the summit, PM Shehbaz had
suggested
the formation of a task force to counter Israeli aggression and expansionism, while terming its attack on Qatar a “hegemonic ambition on part of Israel to control the whole region”.",2025-09-16,Dawn.com,1009,0.000136
https://www.dawn.com/news/1941712/gender-and-the-fight-against-erasure,GENDER AND THE FIGHT AGAINST ERASURE - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"The body is a human being’s first home and first identity. Now, imagine being born into a home that does not acknowledge your reality.
That is only a vague reflection of how the life of a transgender person begins. The term “transgender” has received much attention in recent years, yet it remains widely misunderstood.
Many conflicting definitions circulate around it. Some believe that only individuals born with ambiguous genitalia are truly transgender. Others connect the term with the traditional Khwaja Sira culture of the Subcontinent. Some even make harsh and unfounded claims that transgender persons are simply men or women cross-dressing to attract the opposite gender for physical relationships.
What is often overlooked is that behind every transgender person’s life experience lies a medical condition — that of gender dysphoria. It is a deeply misunderstood and rarely discussed condition, even among qualified medical practitioners. To understand it, imagine being forced to wear shoes that are too small for your feet. They hurt with every step, but you are told you must keep wearing them.
Now imagine that the pain is not just physical; you are judged, shamed and even abandoned by your family and friends for wanting to take them off. You are told that this discomfort is your duty, justified by culture, religion or tradition. Now take that feeling and apply it to your own body. Imagine that the thing causing you pain is not just a pair of shoes, but your own body not matching who you truly are. That is what a gender dysphoric person lives with every day.
In 2011, the Supreme Court of Pakistan took a significant step by
recognising the rights
and dignity of gender-diverse communities, offering long overdue visibility to those pushed to the margins. The judgment not only called for an end to invasive gender verification by medical boards, but also urged institutions such as the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to abandon the dehumanising labels once suggested for transgender persons.
Pakistan’s transgender and Khwaja Sira communities are navigating a shifting legal landscape that alternates between recognition and rejection. An identity meant to affirm dignity has been reduced to a bureaucratic checkbox. Eos presents, with permission, an essay commissioned by the Human Rights of Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) that looks at the human cost of erasure, the cultural myths that sustain discrimination and the everyday resilience of gender minorities determined to be seen as they are…
As a result, Nadra eventually introduced a neutral ‘X’ marker through the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules of 2020. However, this single-option marker stands in contradiction to the true spirit of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2018, which upholds a person’s right to self-perceived identity, allowing them to be recognised as male, female or transgender.
For many, the ‘X’ marker feels alienating, as it erases specific identities and reinforces segregation rather than fostering inclusion. The early hope that followed these legal reforms was shaken by the 2023 Federal Shariat Court
(FSC) ruling
that struck down self-perceived identity as the basis for legal recognition.
By reinstating the requirement for medical and biological verification, the FSC ruling has placed transgender and Khwaja Sira individuals back under institutional scrutiny. This has not only created legal confusion for Nadra and other state bodies, but it has also reopened pathways for discrimination in education, employment and public life spaces.
FIGHTING FOR A PLACE
While the law continues to shift between progress and regression, the lived realities of transgender individuals unfold quietly in everyday moments, far from courtrooms and official directives.
In a quiet corner of a community office in Lahore, 30-year-old Khan adjusts the strap of his camera before heading to the gym. A passionate photographer and fitness enthusiast, Khan exudes the quiet confidence of a young man rooted in purpose. But beneath his steady demeanour lies a history few care to ask about — one shaped by being assigned female at birth and raised under the rigid control reserved for girls in patriarchal households.
“Transitioning was never just about changing how I looked,” he says. “It was about reclaiming who I always was, after years of being told not to speak loudly, not to sit a certain way, not to dream like a boy.” For many transgender men in Pakistan, such as Khan, life is a constant act of stitching visibility into a society that refuses to see them — a society that equates gender with genitalia and silence with safety.
While transgender men such as Khan struggle to be seen at all, Khwaja Sira persons, such as Faizi, are forced to fight even harder to be recognised on their own terms, especially when the system refuses to see beyond rigid gender binaries.
In the dusty district of Toba Tek Singh, where tradition often stands firmer than the law, Faizi sits at her desk in a crisp police uniform, fixing her dupatta with practised ease. Today, she is a victim support officer with the Punjab Police — a respected figure who offers support to survivors of abuse with the kind of empathy only lived pain can shape. But Faizi is more than her job title. She is a Khwaja Sira person who made legal history in Pakistan.
When her application for an Urdu lecturer post was rejected by the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) in October 2020, on the grounds that she was neither male nor female, she did not retreat. She fought. Faizi took the matter to the Lahore High Court, filing a petition that challenged not just institutional discrimination but the broader erasure of third-gender persons from state systems.
On January 21 2021, the Lahore High Court stayed the entire lecturer recruitment process in response to her petition. Justice Faisal Zaman took notice. For the first time, in February 2021, the PPSC’s hiring processes were suspended as a human rights violation case unfolded in the courtroom. Lawyers argued on principles of dignity, equality and inclusion. Faizi stood her ground. And she won.
Since her victory, every PPSC job advertisement now includes a third gender category. It was a personal triumph as much as a milestone for the entire Khwaja Sira community, a segment of society so often celebrated in cultural folklore yet marginalised in civic life.
Today, Faizi represents the visible face of Pakistan’s third gender struggle. The Khwaja Sira community, more than any other gender minority group in the country, enjoys a relative degree of visibility and partial acceptance. Between 7,500-9,000 CNICs with the ‘X’ gender marker have been issued, primarily to Khwaja Sira individuals and a few transgender women.
But an ‘X’ on a card does not guarantee a livelihood. Despite the government’s repeated announcements to include Khwaja Siras in the public sector workforce, the vast majority still work within the development sector, especially in community-based organisations. Even these spaces, though more inclusive, are far from representative or stable.
THE KHWAJA SIRA EXPERIENCE
Khwaja Sira persons, such as transgender women, are mostly assigned male at birth, but later transition into a third gender identity. What sets them apart is their deep-rooted affiliation with a centuries-old subculture that predates colonial constructs of gender.
The Khwaja Sira tradition has its foundations in South Asia’s classical past, drawn from ancient Sanskrit texts and social roles that existed within royal courts and Sufi shrines. Unlike transgender women, who often identify within the binary gender, Khwaja Sira persons embrace a separate, traditional identity complete with its own rituals, guru-chela systems and codes of conduct.
But the visibility of this community has brought with it both opportunity and confusion. Pakistani society, which can barely accommodate non-binary ideas, continues to misunderstand who Khwaja Siras are.
Many believe they are born with intersex variations or ambiguous genitalia — a belief stemming more from myth than medical truth. Some Khwaja Sira elders perpetuate this narrative as a means of survival in a society that refuses to understand how someone assigned male at birth could reject masculinity. This misunderstanding bleeds into workplaces, where Khwaja Sira persons are mis-gendered, mocked, or quietly excluded — even by the media that celebrates their inclusion.
In reality, only a small fraction of Khwaja Sira persons work in formal organisations. The overwhelming majority are still bound to one of three professions — a system of labour shaped by appearance and societal prejudice.
If a Khwaja Sira person is not considered “aesthetically appealing”, she is likely to be seen begging at traffic signals or marketplaces. Those with striking features or refined dance skills often find employment at celebratory functions — especially in south Punjab, central Punjab and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — performing in secretive, high-paying gigs. The most conventionally attractive are often coerced into or voluntarily enter sex work, where they can earn in one night what government jobs pay in a month.
Despite efforts by the development sector and provincial governments to promote their inclusion, most Khwaja Sira individuals remain economically dependent on a system that pays more, asks fewer questions, and offers a twisted sense of dignity, even at the cost of safety.
Many serve as the silent backbone of their families, sending money for siblings’ schooling, parents’ medicine, or wedding dowries for sisters and, in a few cases, for daughters also, even if those families once rejected them. While they work, they are denied the right to love and partnership, as Pakistani law only permits marriage between a man and a woman, rendering third-gender persons outside the legal definition of companionship and care.
One of the most haunting yet overlooked socio-economic realities shaping Khawaja Sira lives is the concept of the Girya: a male romantic partner who, within Khwaja Sira culture, is often seen as a husband offering protection, financial support and a semblance of belonging. These relationships carry deep emotional weight and cultural significance. But outside this fragile Khwaja Sira circle, they are invisible. The state does not recognise this relation. There is no legal marriage, no formal commitment, only affection navigating through silence. And in that silence, danger thrives. Without recognition, there is no recourse.
Many men enter these relationships for sexual access, cloaked in promises of loyalty, only to abandon the Khwaja Sira partner, leaving behind emotional wreckage and renewed instability. Worse still, these Giryas — so-called protectors — often turn violent. Physical, emotional and financial abuse is common but no court acknowledges the crime because no law acknowledges the relationship. The state sees the Girya as a stranger. The Khwaja Sira sees him as family. And between those two truths lies a justice system that does not speak their language.
Faizi knows this betrayal intimately. Before she ever wore the crisp uniform of a police officer, she too lived in the shadow of such a love, where tenderness and terror blurred, and where the silence around her suffering was deafening. Her rise is not just a personal victory; it is a symbol of resistance from a community forced to live between symbolism and survival.
Faizi stands tall in the Punjab Police today — but how many others like her still wait, bruised by love, betrayed by silence, unseen by law and unrecognised by the nation that calls them its citizens?

THE STRUGGLE OF TRANSGENDERS
Khan shares the story of a fellow trans man — one whose journey lays bare the intersections of gender, family honour, and economic exclusion. Assigned female at birth and denied the chance to transition, this transgender man was forcibly married to a cis-gender man, subjected to years of marital rape, and bore two children before the marriage collapsed. Today, he lives with his children, having finally socially and medically transitioned. His children now call him “Abu”, fully accepting him as their father.
However, without a male CNIC reflecting his identity, he is unemployable in the formal sector. “He looks like a man, lives like a father but, in the eyes of the state, he is neither,” Khan explains. This bureaucratic erasure is compounded by social ignorance: workplace harassment, gendered ridicule, and relentless questions about bodies and “what is in your pants.”
Khan shared an experience of another fellow transgender man hired by a corporate company. Once his colleagues learned of his trans experience, he was no longer seen as himself — he became the “guy who was once a girl.”
While transgender men such as Khan’s friend are punished for asserting their identity, transgender women such as Wafa often survive by erasing theirs.
I met Wafa in her mother’s modest home in Islamabad, where she was visiting from the UAE. Over cups of tea and quiet pauses, she shared the story she rarely speaks aloud, the story behind the woman she has become, far from home. In the corridors of a sleek corporate building in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Wafa sits behind a desk in the marketing department of a regional firm. With a degree in marketing and a talent for strategic campaigns, she is well-regarded by her colleagues, and known for her professionalism and creative edge.
She earns a stable income, supports her family in Pakistan, and manages her sibling’s education and parents’ medical expenses. But behind the polished presentations and confident smile lies a journey laced with sacrifice, isolation and one of the truths of being a transgender woman from Pakistan: to survive, one must hide who one really is — that’s the only survival tactic.
Assigned male at birth, Wafa has always identified as a woman. In the absence of community support, she relied entirely on her savings to undergo gender-affirming surgeries in Thailand. Every dirham she earned in the Gulf, she saved meticulously. “I wanted to come home as myself,” she says. “With dignity. With truth.”
Upon returning to Pakistan, she approached Nadra in 2023 to have her identity documents legally updated to reflect the woman she had always been. She was hopeful. After all, the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench had issued a historic ruling in 2011 allowing gender-affirming surgery and subsequent changes to identity documents to an applicant from Rawalpindi. Moreover, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2018 recognised a person’s right to self-identify. But what followed was an experience she describes as “more violent than surgery.”
Nadra referred her to Services Hospital Lahore for a medical examination. There, a urologist questioned her about her romantic life while examining her. But worse was still to come. The gynaecologist, who was also the head of department at the Services Institute of Medical Sciences, invited 40 medical students to examine Wafa’s surgically constructed genitalia, without her consent.
“I begged them to at least use gloves,” she recalled. “I just wanted some dignity.” Days later, she developed a vaginal infection. With her health deteriorating and her emotional well-being shattered, Wafa left the country once again — travelling back to the UAE, this time on the same male passport she had tried so hard to update.
Nadra had offered her an ‘X’ gender marker, but she refused. For transgender women such as Wafa, the ‘X’ category is not an option but an erasure. “If I take the ‘X’ marker,” she explains, “I can never return to the UAE. Gulf countries do not accept ‘X’ as a gender. I will not even be allowed to enter for Umrah or Hajj.” For many transgender persons and Khawaja Sira individuals, this exclusion is not just bureaucratic — it is spiritual. “Imagine wanting to pray in Mecca and being told your gender disqualifies you,” she says.

CHANGING SOCIETAL ATTITUDES
Wafa’s story reflects a critical shift in the transgender community in Pakistan. More and more transgender women are actively disassociating themselves from the traditional Khwaja Sira culture.
While some still take refuge in deras [homes owned by Khwaja Sira elders] and guru-led households for survival, many do not identify with the centuries-old customs and rituals. Their disassociation is not disrespect — it is about identity. Transgender women identify as women, not as a third gender. Their transition is often shaped by medical processes and gender-affirming treatment, and their struggle is to be recognised as female, not as “other.”
Despite similarities in lived discrimination, transgender women lack the community safety net that Khwaja Sira culture provides. Without a guru or a traditional support circle, many are left to face violence, homelessness and economic exclusion alone.
Wafa recalls that many transgender women apply for jobs under their legal male name, because changing it legally is nearly impossible without accepting the ‘X’ gender marker. But, at the workplace, they are ridiculed, questioned, or worse — sexually harassed. One woman interviewed during this research described being sexually propositioned during her job interview for a receptionist post, simply because her appearance did not match her official documents.
Family rejection is almost a certainty for transgender women in Pakistan. Many are pushed out of their homes the moment they begin to express who they truly are. With nowhere else to go, they often end up in Khwaja Sira deras, not out of choice but out of desperation. Some do not even identify with the traditional Khwaja Sira culture but are forced to adapt just to survive.
While working on this very piece, I met a transgender woman who had gone through full gender-affirming surgeries here in Pakistan. She was in love and wanted nothing more than to marry her partner and live a quiet life as a wife. She showed me her medical reports and kept asking for help to get her CNIC changed to female so she could marry legally. Her eyes were full of hope and fear at the same time. But there was nothing I could offer her. Nothing except to hold her hand as she cried, not because she doubted who she was, but because her country refused to see her the way she saw herself.
One of the most painful struggles transgender women face is mis-gendering. Wafa explains it best: “We work so hard to pass as women. We reshape our bodies, change our voices and live in fear of violence. But one wrong pronoun from a doctor, an officer, or even a friend, and it is like none of it ever mattered.” Mis-gendering is not a mistake — it is a rejection of truth. It reinforces the idea that gender is dictated by birth, not by identity, and invalidates the tremendous physical and emotional labour transgender women invest in becoming themselves.
What complicates the transgender woman’s struggle, which is already marred with complexities, is rejection by both the state and society. While Khwaja Sira persons are more culturally accepted — celebrated in media and recognised in rituals — transgender women remain misunderstood, seen by many as “Western imports” or as rejecting their biological role. But, in truth, they are simply asking to be seen for who they are. The law may offer them rights, but the practice of those rights in Nadra offices, hospitals or workplaces remains rooted in cruelty and ignorance.
Transgender women in Pakistan are fighting for inclusion and to be recognised as women. Until that simple truth is honoured, no policy, act or surgery will be enough to make them feel safe in their own country.
INCLUSIVE LAWS, EXCLUSIONARY SOCIETY
As he speaks, Khan’s voice shifts from exhaustion to quiet defiance. “I do not want an ‘X’ on my CNIC. I am not a third category. I am a man.” He laments the aftermath of the 2020 rules that hijacked the spirit of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2018, reducing the hard-won right of self-identification to a meaningless bureaucratic checkbox.
“No transgender man I know wants the ‘X’ marker. Why would we volunteer for a lifetime of stigma and scrutiny on every job form, at every airport, outside every Nadra office?” For Khan and many others, the fight is not just for recognition — it is for dignity, documentation, and the right to live without having to explain one’s existence at every turn. “People think we are opening a Pandora ’s Box,” Khan sighs. “But the truth is, we have been locked inside one our whole lives.”
These are not stories of the exotic or the extreme. They are the daily lived experiences of citizens who pay taxes, raise families, care for parents and seek dignity in Pakistan. They are photographers, marketers, survivors of abuse and seekers of love. Yet they face violence at police checkpoints, ridicule in waiting rooms, neglect in census forms and erasure from employment.
Pakistan may have progressive laws recognising the third gender on paper, but hearts, minds and systems have not caught up. Until schools teach respect, employers show compassion, and government officials practise empathy, gender minorities in this country will continue to survive, not live.
The burden does not rest solely on the transgender community — it rests squarely on the shoulders of our institutions, media, mosques, schools and each of us. The struggle for inclusion is about restoring what is rightfully theirs — their voice, their body, their future.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943525/suspected-serial-rapist-confesses-before-karachi-magistrate,Suspected serial rapist confesses before Karachi magistrate - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Saturday recorded the confessional statement of a suspected serial rapist in six cases pertaining to subjecting underage girls to sexual assaults.
The investigating officer (IO) moved an application before a judicial magistrate (south) and submitted that the suspect was willing to record his confessional statement under Section 164 of the
Criminal Procedure Code
(CrPC) before the court.
After completing the legal formalities, the magistrate recorded the statement of the suspect in which he confessed to having raped minor girls in these cases.
After recording the confession, the magistrate sent him to prison on judicial remand and directed the IOs to complete investigations.
The prosecution said that the suspect was
arrested
from Qayyumabad on Sept 11 as the matter came to the authorities’ attention after one of his alleged victims managed to obtain a USB drive from the suspect and took it to a video shop where shop owner detected the presence of explicit content on the drive and informed area residents, who apprehended the suspect and beat him up before handing him over to the police. The videos have been sent to Punjab for forensic examination.
Six cases have been registered against the suspect at the Defence police station under Sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 377 (unnatural offence) of the
Pakistan Penal Code
.
A separate FIR was also lodged on the complaint of the state against the suspect and estate agent Ijaz Awan, who provided him accommodation on rent, under Section 11/3 of the
Sindh Information of Temporary Residents Act
and the court on Saturday also sent the suspected rapist to jail in this case, while the estate agent was on pre-arrest bail.

PM Shehbaz arrived in China on Saturday to attend the SCO Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit held from August 31 to September 1. Besides Pakistan, the SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Another 16 countries are affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”.
“We respect all international and bilateral treaties and expect similar principles to be followed by all SCO members,” PM Shehbaz said at the summit today, in an apparent reference to fellow SCO member India and its
unilateral move
to hold the
IWT
in abeyance in April.
“Uninterrupted access to due share of water as per existing treaties among SCO members will strengthen the SCO working smoothly and will support the achievement of broader goals for which the SCO was established,” he stressed at the summit in China’s Tianjin.
India held the IWT in abeyance following the April 22
attack
in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi
blamed
on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “
act of war
”.
In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague
issued
a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
At the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz called for a “comprehensive and structural dialogue to discuss all outstanding disputes”, adding: “I will request your consideration to lead this dialogue under your sagacious leadership so that they can have its dividends as early as possible.”
The prime minister reaffirmed that Pakistan sought a “normal and stable relationship with all its neighbours”. “It seeks dialogue and diplomacy over conflict and confrontation,” he highlighted.
PM Shehbaz noted: “Pakistan has always believed in the power of multilateralism, dialogue and diplomacy, and shunning unilateralism. And yet, to our shock and deep disappointment, the region witnessed extremely disturbing developments during the last few months.
“Pakistan supports and respects the sovereignty and integrity of all SCO members and its neighbours,” he added.
“We will continue our efforts, along with all SCO members and the chairman of SCO, to promote progress and prosperity in the entire region and to ensure lasting peace in South Asia,” PM Shehbaz pledged.
“Pakistan has always abided by the UN and SCO charters and will always respect the principles that will hold dear to all of us for our collective good. As a peace-loving nation, Pakistan has always advocated dialogue and diplomacy, consultation over confrontation,” he reiterated.
During his address, the premier also highlighted the severe floods that Pakistan was once again facing.
“My country is once again passing through unprecedented torrential rains, cloudbursts and massive devastation due to consequent flooding in three of our major rivers,” PM Shehbaz said, highlighting huge loss of lives and livestock, as well as severe damage to infrastructure and crops.
“We deeply appreciate the international community’s, including China’s, solidarity, sympathy and support with us,” he said, hailing the rescue and rebuilding efforts of “my brave and resilient people”.
At the outset of his speech, the prime minister noted that the port city of Tianjin, where the summit is taking place, represented “China’s core values as a connector and bridge of cultures and civilisation”.
He thanked President Xi and his government for the warm hospitality and excellent arrangements for the SCO gathering. The premier also extended his felicitations to Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan on their national days today and yesterday, respectively.
PM Shehbaz further said: “For us, the SCO is a platform that best represents Pakistan’s abiding commitment to regional cooperation and integration. China’s successful tenure as chair of the SCO is reflective of President Xi’s sagacious and visionary leadership.”
He stressed that China’s “global leadership” was exemplified not only through the bloc but also in landmark initiatives, such as the
Belt and Road Initiative
and the
China-Pakistan Economic Corridor
(CPEC).
‘Irrefutable evidence of foreign hands in terrorism on Pakistani soil’
At the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz also highlighted the issue of terrorism and said Pakistan had “irrefutable evidence of involvement of some foreign hands” in the
Jaffar Express hijacking
in March.
The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of at least
26 passengers
, including 18 security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.
“We have irrefutable evidence of involvement of some foreign hands in the devastating Jaffar Express train hostage incident, as well as countless other terrorist attacks against us in Balochistan and KP provinces of Pakistan,” the premier said at the summit.
“Those who have long used terrorism for advancing their political interests must know that the world no longer buys this fictitious narrative.”
Days after the hijacking, the military spokesperson had said India was the
main sponsor
“in this terrorist incident in Balochistan and others before”. In April, the Pakistan Mission to the United Nations had also said the country had “
credible evidence
” proving that the attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”.
At the SCO summit, the prime minister noted: “The menace of terrorism, separatism, [and] extremism continues to pose a grave threat to Pakistan and endanger peace and security of the entire SCO region and the SCO family.
“We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with the fullest force at our command, including state terrorism in clear and ambiguous terms,” he added.
Recalling the country’s “great sacrifices in combating terrorism not only for its own self but for the region and far beyond”, PM Shehbaz
reiterated
that Pakistan had lost over 90,000 valuable lives and endured economic losses of over $152 billion.
“A sacrifice which has no parallel in history,” the premier said, adding that there “cannot be a bigger manifestation of our unwavering commitment to defeat terrorism with the cooperation of all SCO members and global powers around the globe”.
Afghanistan and regional connectivity
The prime minister also voiced Pakistan’s desire for a “peaceful and stable” Afghanistan, noting that it was not only in Islamabad’s interest but that of the entire region.
“While we remain engaged in building our ties with the Afghan leadership to leverage them as economic partners and good neighbours, we hope that this cooperation with Afghanistan and our
trilateral meetings
between China, Pakistan and Afghanistan will have positive results in times to come,” Shehbaz said.
“As SCO leaders, we have reaffirmed year after year the significance of enhanced regional connectivity. This requires efficient land, air and rail transport corridors to ensure the reliability of supply chains,” he stressed.
The premier asserted that the expansion of CPEC could serve as a “practical demonstration of SCO’s vision for regional connectivity and economic integration”.
‘Heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza’
During his address, PM Shehbaz also condemned Israel’s
deadly attacks
on Iran in June this year and its “heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza”.
“Israel’s unjustified aggression against our fellow brotherly member country Iran, a fellow SCO state, is condemnable and therefore unacceptable,” the prime minister said.
“The suffering and starvation unfolding in Gaza is a festering wound on our collective conscience. We reiterate our call for an immediate end to gruesome violence and heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza,” the premier said.
He underscored that Pakistan has consistently supported the UN-mandated
two-state solution
, which meant the creation of an independent state of Palestine with pre-1967 borders and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
Meetings with SCO leaders
PM Shehbaz also held meetings with fellow SCO leaders on the summit’s sidelines.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian condoled the prime minister on the ongoing floods in Pakistan and expressed his country’s support.

LAHORE: The residents in different localities of Multan, Lodhran, and Bahawalpur districts remain homeless as the government has failed to plug the breaches at the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the Sutlej River despite the passage of 12 days.
Communities in Noraja Bhutta, Bahadurpur, Basti Lang, Kanu, and Dipal in Jalalpur Pirwala; Tarut Basharat, Daily Rajanpur, and Belaywala in Lodhran; Dunyapur, Jhangra, and Muradpur Soiwala in Bahawalpur were forced to live on the banks of the embankment, as their homes remained inundated.
Basti Lang resident Muhammad Bakhsh said the water was rising again in his union council, adding it would continue to rise if the Noraja Bhutta embankment was not plugged completely. “We are also hearing about another medium level flood in the Sutlej approaching Jalalpur Pirwala in a day or two, which would further increase the water level around our homes,” he said.
“We are also hearing that the government is plugging the Noraja Bhutta embankment but the water has yet to recede from these areas…,” he rued. Ijaz Khan, from the Tarut Bashart union council, said that the water level was increasing due to the breaches. He said that the government was placing heavy stones around the M-5 Motorway bridge to save it, but the water was not receding.
Multan Irrigation Department Chief Engineer Nawaz Bajwa told
Dawn
that three breaches in the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the Sutlej River were plugged to save Jalalpur Pirwala city. He said that they also saved the primary gas pipeline to Punjab.
Punjab Minister for Irrigation Kazim Pirzada revealed that 70 and 90 per cent of the population in Alipur and Jalalpur Pirwala, respectively, was affected by the recent floods. He said that Jalalpur required evacuation and Alipur needed a massive relief operation, with teams working round the clock to deliver essential supplies to Sultanpur, Shahbazpur, Seetpur, and other affected towns.
Normal flow
Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that the water flow across major rivers in Punjab had returned to normal levels. He said a low- to medium-level flood situation continued in the Sutlej River.
According to PDMA data, the Sutlej River is flowing at 95,000 cusecs at Ganda Singh Wala and 81,000 cusecs at the Suleimanki point. The Chenab River shows a flow of 55,000 cusecs at Marala, which reduces to 24,000 cusecs at Khanki Headworks and 29,000 cusecs at Qadirabad.
The flow at Head Trimmu was recorded at 35,000 cusecs. The Panjnad Headworks reported a flow of 118,000 cusecs. Meanwhile, the Ravi River presented lower readings, with 6,000 cusecs at Jassar, 9,000 cusecs at Shahdara, and 30,000 cusecs at Head Sidhnai. The flow at Balloki Headworks was measured at 28,000 cusecs.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
According to NIH, the latest case was detected in a 20-month-old infant in the southern KP’s Tank district, taking the province’s total tally to 16. Fifteen of them have been detected in southern KP, according to the NIH.
Last week, the KP government
launched
a polio immunisation campaign, with emphasis on the south of the province, where polio teams faced the most resistance.
The latest case has taken the total cases recorded in 2025 to 24, according to NIH — including 16 from KP, six from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Noting the prevalence of polio in the south of KP, the NIH said, “A comprehensive strategic Roadmap for Polio eradication in Southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been developed and finalised.
“The plan incorporates microplanning innovations, gap analyses, and targeted strategies and interventions to address persistent challenges,” it added.
To deal with growing cases in the region, NIH stated that a campaign will be carried out in the south of the province — set to run from September 15 to 18.
Part of an immunisation campaign announced last week, the three-day drive aims to target Bannu, Bajaur and seven districts of the Dera Ismail Khan division.
In its statement, the NIH appealed to parents to cooperate with polio teams and complete their child’s immunisation course.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.",2025-09-01,Rukhsana Khan,522,9.9e-05
https://www.dawn.com/news/1940101,HPV vaccine - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"BY and large, it is the low-income countries that face the greatest burden of disease.
Several factors contribute to this sobering reality including poor access to healthcare and inadequate resources. Which is why regular vaccine campaigns, undertaken to prevent the onset of many of the illnesses seen mostly in developing nations, are absolutely crucial in a country like ours. In this context, the planned addition of a new vaccine to the Expanded Programme on Immunisation is a welcome development.
The campaign for the
phased rollout
of the
human papillomavirus vaccine
to prevent cervical cancer is set to begin on Sept 15. In Sindh, the aim is to immunise 4.1m girls from nine to 14 years against the virus — although once incorporated fully in the EPI, the focus will shift to nine-year-olds and hopefully become part of a school-outreach programme. The campaign will be rolled out in
Punjab
, ICT and AJK at the same time; in KP in 2026; and in Balochistan and GB in 2027.
Without regular screening, cervical cancer can go undetected in females, especially as symptoms may be absent in the early stages. And in a country like Pakistan, where routine pelvic examinations are not actively recommended, negligence can cost lives.
Around 5,000 women in the country are
diagnosed
with cervical cancer each year; 60pc of them succumb to the disease. And these are only the numbers recorded. It is safe to assume that the actual number of cases for this cancer — the second most common one among women of child-bearing age — is far higher.
By including the vaccine in the EPI, then, it is hoped that awareness levels are heightened — perhaps, the mothers of the young girls that the HPV vaccine will target under the EPI will learn enough about the risks of cervical cancer to take precautionary steps themselves through inoculation or regular screening. It appears to be a goal worth pursuing.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942275/shortage-of-anaesthetists-in-hospitals-endangers-lives-of-patients-study,Shortage of anaesthetists in hospitals endangers lives of patients: study - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"PESHAWAR: Severe shortage of trained and qualified anaesthetists has been putting the lives of patients at risk in private and public hospitals as doctors stay away from doing specialisation in this field of medical science owing to lack of incentives, according to a study.
Quackery in
anaesthesia
has been the main reason of high mortality, disabilities, cardiac arrests, brain damage and preventable deaths, says the study conducted by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Society of Anaesthesia (KPSA).
It has suggested ban on unsupervised administration of anaesthesia to patients by technicians and deployment of qualified anaesthetists, especially in peripheral hospitals, to safeguard patients’ lives. Additionally, incentives and allowances should be announced to attract specialists and do away with quackery in this critical area, it adds.
The society wants Health Care Commission (HCC) to take action against the hospitals operating without qualified anaesthesia doctors, technicians and nurses. The government should remove from its panel of Sehat Card Plus (SCP), the free healthcare insurance initiative, such hospitals to save patients from complications, it adds.
Action sought against health facilities working without qualified specialists
The study shows that less than one per cent surgeries are performed under the supervision of anaesthesia specialists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
It says that anaesthesia is a state of controlled reversible depression of central nervous system, loss of pain perception and immobility that is sufficient to permit the performance of surgery or other painful procedures in middle income countries like Pakistan where anaesthesia-related deaths after or during surgical procedures are one in 300 in comparison to one in 10,000 in developed countries.
The study says that anaesthesia is used in surgical or other procedure to relieve pain during surgery to keep patients asleep or pain-free through constant monitor every biological function of the patient’s body. Anaesthesiology is inseparable from modern surgery and it is meant to keep patients safe, comfortable and pain-free during the operation, it adds.
The study says that in rural hospitals, anaesthesia is given by unqualified technicians, thus endangering lives of people almost on daily basis. In the process, routine surgeries are turning fatal due to unsafe anaesthesia practices.
Anaesthesia is crucial for pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative and all hospitals doing surgical practice must have qualified anaesthetists with the designated roles and responsibilities.
It says that HCC should make it mandatory for hospitals to have trained anaesthesia staff. It says that hospitals empanelled under SCP programme must have the services of qualified anaesthesia providers. It adds that HCC must link compliance to patients’ safety to presence of trained staff to re-imbursements made from SCP.
KPSA has asked the government to encourage hospitals to invest in qualified staff and safe practices, promote incentive-based compliance for both private and public healthcare providers. It says that private hospitals should be made accountable for not providing safe anaesthesia services to patients.
It says that HCC should implement its own minimum service delivery standards related to anaesthesia and establish a policy advisory body focused on strengthening anaesthesia services across the province.
The society wants policy reforms for anaesthesia safety and quality, facilitate collaboration among key stakeholders and recommend solutions to systemic challenges to streamline decision-making, enhance inter-departmental coordination, proactive identification and resolution of issues.
The study says that hospitals, especially in private sector, are conducting huge number of major surgeries without qualified or even trained anaesthetists.
It says that SCP is being used in all private hospitals regardless of any presence of anaesthetist and HCC is not doing enough to provide basic right to patients in the form of safe surgical procedures.
It says that HCC should stop the illegal practice through licensing and accreditation and audit mechanisms to improve patients’ safety, standardised practices and reduced risk in peripheral areas.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944875,Floods affect 4.2m people in Punjab - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"• PM doubles compensation for families of victims to Rs2m
• 161,000 houses, 395 health facilities damaged in Punjab, UNOCHA says
• Senate panel told deluges left 1,000 dead, millions displaced
ISLAMABAD: As
millions
of people have been affected and hundreds of casualties reported across the country during the recent
floods and monsoon rains
, the prime minister has raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives from Rs1 million to Rs2m.
More than 4.2 million people in 18 districts of Punjab have been affected by the recent floods, with Muzaffargarh alone accounting for over a quarter of the total, according to a Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA)
report
released by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).
Muzaffargarh, located on the bank of the Chenab River, is followed by Jhang with 646,000 affected people (15.3 per cent), Bahawalpur with 514,000 (12.2pc), Khanewal with 397,000 (9.4pc), and Multan with 347,000 (8.2pc). Other affected districts include Vehari, Bahawalnagar, Hafizabad, Okara, Chiniot, Gujrat, Rahim Yar Khan, Kasur, Sialkot, Mandi Bahauddin, Narowal, Dera Ghazi Khan and Gujranwala.
The RNA, conducted from Sept 8 to 18 in collaboration with the government, covered 1,928 mouzas in these 18 flood-hit districts.
Out of 161,000 houses assessed, about 115,700 were partially damaged and 46,000 fully or severely damaged, leaving thousands of families without adequate shelter. More than 93pc of the assessed locations reported some level of housing damage, with the highest numbers in Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan, Khanewal and Jhang. Approximately 2.8m people have been displaced, many forced to leave flooded, damaged or destroyed homes.
According to the report, the affected population faces urgent shelter and non-food item (NFI) needs, particularly tents, tarpaulins, GI sheets, plastic sheeting and winterisation kits, including blankets, bedding, mats, shawls, mosquito nets and warm clothes.
Health facilities
A total of 742 health facilities were assessed across the 18 districts; 395 were reported damaged — 315 partially and 80 fully or severely — posing a serious threat to the continuity of healthcare services. The highest proportions of damage were observed in Gujranwala, Bahawalnagar and Okara.
In absolute terms, Bahawalnagar recorded the greatest impact with 64 facilities damaged, followed by Jhang (55) and Muzaffargarh (46). Other districts also reported significant damage, including Bahawalpur (35), Chiniot (39) and Khanewal (25), with several facilities fully destroyed.
By contrast, Mandi Bahauddin (8pc), Vehari (17pc) and Dera Ghazi Khan (22pc) reported relatively limited impact. The scale of damage in the hardest-hit districts underscores the urgent need to restore and reinforce health infrastructure, as disruptions could reduce access to essential care, delay outbreak response and heighten community vulnerability.
The RNA highlights a significant disease burden across 1,928 flood-affected villages. Malaria was the most reported health concern (64pc of assessed villages), followed by skin infections and diarrhoea, indicating deteriorating water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Dengue was also reported at considerable levels, adding to the challenge of vector-borne diseases.
Educational institutions
According to the School Education Department, floods damaged 667 schools across the 18 districts, of which 54pc were girls’ schools.
Moreover, 217 schools were repurposed as evacuation centres, affecting 101,263 enrolled students. Most damage was recorded in Sialkot (210 schools), followed by Jhang (110), Gujrat (83), Muzaffargarh and Kot Addu (82 each), and Rahim Yar Khan (15).
Nearly 97,000 water supply schemes were reported damaged. Over one-third of the assessed villages reported damage to these schemes. Of the 48,500 fully damaged schemes, 60pc were in Muzaffargarh, 12pc in Jhang, and 10pc in Bahawalpur.
Before the floods, communities in most districts relied heavily on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods. Crop farming was the primary source of income for over 85pc of communities in Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Kasur, Khanewal, and Vehari, with similarly high levels in Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, Chiniot, Multan, and Narowal.
Livestock
Livestock rearing engaged more than 70pc of communities in most areas, while daily wage labour was a key income source in Bahawalnagar, Gujranwala, and Khanewal.  Floods have devastated these livelihoods by damaging crops, killing livestock, and disrupting agricultural cycles, leaving many households without produce or animals to sell. As farming activities stall, wage opportunities linked to farm work and local markets are shrinking, pushing vulnerable communities deeper into income loss and food insecurity.
Most communities reported having food stocks lasting only a week or less. Food insecurity is most critical in Multan, where 81.7pc of communities reported very limited stocks. Similarly, 76.2pc in Bahawalnagar, 74pc in Muzaffargarh, and 61.5pc in Bahawalpur said their food would run out within days.
Ex-gratia assistance
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet Secretariat was informed that the premier raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives during the floods from Rs1m to Rs2m. The revised compensation package will have a financial impact of about Rs2.033 billion.
The committee’s meeting, chaired by Senator Rana Mehmoodul Hassan, was briefed on the overall flood situation by a member of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
He reported that around 1,000 people had died in the recent floods, while about 1,000 others had sustained various injuries. He added that the numbers were expected to rise once rescue, evacuation, and relief operations were completed and floodwaters receded.
The NDMA said around three million people had been rescued or evacuated between June 26 and Sept 19. The committee was also told the floods damaged 12,559 houses and resulted in the loss of 6,509 livestock. The figures are expected to rise as assessments continued.
The meeting was attended by senators Saadia Abbasi, Ataur Rehman, Aimal Wali Khan, Mohammad Abdul Qadir, Dr Afnanullah Khan, and Shahadat Awan, along with the secretary of the Establishment Division, special secretary of the Cabinet Division, chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and other senior officials.

• Maryam says Punjab is working while other provinces are busy criticising it
• 2,200 survey teams with 10,000 personnel from army, other depts deployed in the province
• Azma Bokhari threatens to sue Nadeem Afzal Chan over loan claim
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: As the Punjab government on Saturday launched a survey to assess the losses caused by recent floods, the PPP urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to accept its
demand
for providing immediate relief to the flood-affected people through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
The PML-N and the PPP — coalition partners at the Centre and in Punjab — have been at
odds
over how to help the flood victims, with the former’s government in Punjab insisting on using its own resources, while the latter is adamant about channelling the aid through the BISP.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, PPP Secretary General Humayun Khan, Senator Palwasha Khan and the party’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leader Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha criticised the Punjab government, saying that the BISP already had the required data and was the most effective mechanism to assist flood-hit families.
Humayun Khan said the people were enduring severe hardships due to the floods, recalling that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had visited flood-affected areas in Punjab, and reiterated the demand for immediate relief through the BISP.
Palwasha Khan expressed regret over what she termed “unfortunate remarks” from some PML-N ministers against the PPP despite being coalition partners. “It is regrettable that the Punjab government has used such language for its coalition partner. The Punjab government says it will not bow down to anyone. Then why go to the IMF? The impression is being created that Punjab belongs to one party. Punjab is not the domain of any one party; similarly, no province is the exclusive domain of any party. All provinces of Pakistan belong to all Pakistanis,” she said.
She proposed that the electricity bills of flood-affected families be waived until they fully recover. She said the scale of the damage caused by the floods was immense and could not yet be fully estimated.
She recalled that BISP funds had previously been disbursed during the holy month of Ramazan and asked: “Why does the name of BISP cause so much pain?”
Without elaborating, she said that when the Punjab chief minister faced challenges, “the most vocal voices of support came from Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and the PPP”.
Ali Shah Bacha criticised not only the PML-N but also the PTI’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for what he called its failure to help flood victims despite being in power in the province for the past 12 years. He said the
floods
in KP were different in nature from those in Punjab and Sindh, as they were caused by cloudbursts that wiped out entire villages and caused hundreds of deaths.
“The prime minister and the chief minister came for just one day, distributed cheques and left,” Mr Bacha said, terming the role of both the federal and provincial governments in rescue and relief efforts “disappointing”.
“The Punjab chief minister says they do not need the PPP’s advice. But when the PML-N government is in trouble, it remembers the PPP and its leadership. When the PML-N wants votes on a bill, it turns to Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari,” he added.
“If Maryam Nawaz is the daughter of Nawaz Sharif, then don’t forget that Bilawal Bhutto is the son of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto and the grandson of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,” he remarked.
Flood losses survey
The Punjab government launched a survey to assess the losses suffered by people in the province due to recent floods, but refrained from giving any timeline for completing the exercise or for the start of compensation payments to the more than four million affected residents.
“Some 2,200 survey teams comprising 10,000 members of Pakistan Army, revenue, agriculture and livestock departments and district administration will carry out the survey. Full compensation to the affected families — Rs1 million for a completely destroyed house, Rs500,000 for a partially damaged house, Rs500,000 for loss of livestock, and Rs20,000 per acre (up to 12 acres) for farmers — will be provided based on the survey report,” Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said at the launch of the Punjab Flood Survey Campaign.
“We will make sure that every single flood victim is compensated and resettled. These survey teams are my eyes, ears and hands,” she said, administering an oath to the survey teams, whom she described as the “sons and daughters of Punjab”.
Indirectly responding to criticism from the PTI and PPP over what they termed her ‘flood photo/video shoot,’ the chief minister said: “If someone is working, the camera should show it because the public deserves to know what its CM is doing. We don’t seek the camera as the real work is happening, it speaks for itself.”
She said Punjab was working while other provinces were busy criticising it. The chief minister said she was often asked how she coped with criticism. “I say Punjab is progressing and that is why criticism exists. We close our ears to negativity and keep our eyes fixed on the goal,” she remarked, adding that people from other provinces wished to live in Punjab.
She thanked Pir Pagara for appreciating Punjab’s flood management.
The CM criticised the PPP for suggesting the use of the BISP database to help flood-affected people. “Distributing Rs10,000 to each flood-affected person through BISP data will do no good,” she said.
The PPP leadership, including MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, had urged the Punjab government to use BISP data instead of undertaking a lengthy survey to provide immediate relief to flood victims.
Tensions over loan remarks
As the dispute between the two coalition partners over the BISP issue continued, senior PPP leader Nadeem Afzal Chan said on X: “Punjab has emerged as the biggest borrower among all provinces, securing a staggering Rs405 billion loan from the State Bank in just the first 38 days (July 1 to August 8, 2025) of the current fiscal year (2025-26).”
Responding to the claim, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari threatened to sue Mr Chan under defamation laws and the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
“Chan Sahib, you were a decent man, but for the past few days it seems you are either under mental stress or deliberately running fake propaganda against Punjab,” she said, emphasising that the facts about the loan issue had already been shared with the media on Aug 26. “Now repeating this false narrative falls under Peca.” Ms Bokhari added that under the Punjab Defamation Bill, Mr Chan would have to prove the “fabricated news” in court.

The plea, filed by Advocate Syed Nazir Agha, sought a six-month suspension of the repatriation drive. He appeared before the bench alongside Additional Attorney General Muhammad Farid Dogar and Assistant Advocate General Zahoor Ahmed Baloch.
Advocate Agha argued that thousands of Afghan children are enrolled in schools and colleges in Balochistan with only a few months left before their ann­ual examinations. Forcing them to return at this stage, he said, would disrupt their education and risk loss of properties belonging to many refugee families.
He further maintained that Afghans married to Pakistani nationals were entitled to citizenship under the Pakistan Citizenship Act 1951. The expulsion of refugees, he contended, violated Articles 2A, 9, 25 and 25A of the Constitution. He urged the court to restrain the authorities and issue appropriate directions.
After hearing initial arguments, the bench admitted the petition and issued notices to the respondents, directing them to submit written replies at the next hearing.
The petition named Balochistan chief secretary, federal interior secretary, secretary of the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions, Quetta commissioner, Balochistan IGP, Levies Force DG as respondents.

Speaking to the media during his visit to the site of the BRT Yellow Line project on Monday, he said PTCL and K-Electric had demanded millions of rupees for the transfer of utility lines, which had delayed progress.
He said the government was in constant contact with the institutions to resolve these issues and had directed the transport secretary to settle the current dispute with KE within 24 hours.
He said the provincial government, with the support of the World Bank, was working day and night on the
Yellow Line
project. Work on depots and other construction activities was in full swing, he added.
Mr Memon, who also holds the information and transport portfolios, also visited the bridge named after the late Senator Taj Haider, an important part of the Yellow Line in Karachi, to review the construction work.
Sharjeel says PTCL, KE demand millions for relocating underground lines; reviews construction of Senator Taj Haider Bridge
The Senator Taj Haider Bridge is in the final stages of completion. The government aims to complete this bridge within a week and open it to the public.
Secretary Transport Asad Zamin and project director of the BRT Yellow Line Zameer Abbasi were also present on the occasion.
Mr Memon said that after the inauguration of the Senator Taj Haider Bridge,
Jam Sadiq Bridge
would be demolished and rebuilt in a modern style. He explained that the new bridge would feature separate tracks for pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists to ensure safe and convenient facilities for citizens.
He said the Pakistan Peoples Party-led Sindh government was com­m­itted to providing modern tra­vel facilities to the people of Karachi.
‘Pink scooters’
This week, “
Pink Scooters
” will be distributed free of cost exclusiv­ely to women to help them meet their travel needs more conveniently.
The senior minister added that a large fleet of double-decker buses and electric buses would also arrive in Karachi in the coming weeks.
He mentioned that during Pres­ident of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari’s recent visit to China, important meetings were held to discuss establishing manufacturing plants in Sindh for the production of electric and regular buses.
According to him, this step would not only improve travel facilities but also create local employment opportunities.
He further said that Chinese inve­stors had shown strong interest in the
Dhabeji Special Economic Zone
, where new industries would be established, creating jobs for the youth.
President Zardari, during his China
visit
, particularly stressed the need to set up more industries to boost Pakistan’s economy and to train local manpower in China so they could secure employment opportunities.
He noted that during President Zardari’s visit to China, detailed discussions took place on expanding cooperation in energy, agriculture, and solid waste management. He des­­cribed the visit as highly successful, adding that major projects in these sectors would soon be launched.
Commenting on the use of inappropriate language by a journalist from Punjab, he said such behaviour was regrettable. He noted that while policies may be debated, no one had the right to target an entire community.
Mr Memon emphasised that the priority right now should be helping flood victims rather than engaging in political disputes.
Criticising the federal government’s wheat policy, he said that if farmers had been provided with a
support price
, as suggested by President Zardari, the country would not be forced to spend billions of rupees on wheat imports.
He pointed out that Sindh still had 1.2 million tonnes of wheat, but the federal government was unwilling to purchase it from farmers at a fair price.
The senior minister stressed that Pakistan is an agricultural country and supporting farmers is the only way to strengthen the economy.
On the flood situation in Punjab, he said the scale of destruction could have been reduced with better planning, but inexperience had made the losses worse. By contrast, he said, Sindh managed the situation more effectively under the direct monitoring of the chief minister and the establishment of a control room, which helped limit the damage.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945112/many-helpless-as-flood-relief-work-ends-in-alipur,Many helpless as flood relief work ends in Alipur - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: Thousands of flood-affected residents in Tehsil Alipur of Muzaffargarh district are left to survive on their own, marooned without access to food, shelter, and essential supplies after the district administration officially ended rescue and relief operations, despite vast areas remaining submerged.
The decision has plunged already vulnerable communities into a deeper crisis. In water-logged villages including Azmatpur, Lati Marhi and Bait Nabi Shah, stagnant floodwater continues to fill homes, but with official relief channels severed, families have nowhere to turn.
The administration has also shut down relief centres established in local schools, compelling displaced individuals to return to their destroyed or inundated houses.
The scale of the disaster is immense. Of the 14 union councils in Tehsil Alipur, 11 were swallowed by floodwaters. Officials estimate that nearly 400,000 of the tehsil’s 700,000 people have been affected and forced to abandon their homes.
District official links provision of further relief to completion of damage assessment survey
For residents like Abid Khan, this means living under the open sky.
“All of the houses in our basti have collapsed,” Mr Abid said. “We have to live under the sky. We did not get any tents, and my children and other family members have to spend the day under the scorching sun.”
Khan, from the Azmatpur area, added that his family has no ration and no fodder for their surviving cattle, which are their primary source of livelihood.
Muzaffar Gopang from the village of Kundrala said his family has been without a roof for 15 days.
“Our house collapsed and water is still inundating our low-lying area. We cannot even go back,” he said. Mr Gopang stated their cattle are stranded on riverbanks without fodder and that families feel completely cut off. “The authorities did not visit our areas.”
Describing the scene of utter destruction, he reported floodwaters reaching 10 to 12 feet. “All the houses of Basti Chandia have washed away. We are helpless and waiting for any relief. Ministers and officials visited other areas, but we did not receive any help.”
Others reported receiving no aid at all. Ghulam Fareed Chandia from Bait Mullanwali said his community has not received a single packet of ration in over two weeks.
“No one from the ministers or the district and tehsil administration has visited us,” he said. “All the houses of Basti Chandia have washed away. We are helpless and waiting for any relief.”
Muzaffargarh Deputy Commissioner Usman Tahir Jappa confirmed the conclusion of the rescue and relief phase.
“The rescue and relief operation was completed, and we are now starting a survey to address the issues of the people,” Mr Jappa told
Dawn.
He added that relief would be provided after the damage assessment survey is completed.

floods
and rains in the province.
Due to the heavy rains and floods, which also disrupted the train operations for a short time across the country, the power distribution companies (Discos), including the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) and Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco) also faced a massive loss of electricity supply infrastructure, Dawn has learnt.
According to an internal report compiled by the Pakistan Railways (PR) and shared with
Dawn
, the Narowal-Sialkot section has been closed since Aug 27 after the floodwater breached a portion of the track. Moreover, a Girder Span of bridge No 7 near Aik Nullah misaligned, allowing floodwater to maintain a high level, overtopping the track.
The report says that the repair works are underway on the damaged section, which is expected to be ready for resumption of the train operation by Sept 12.
The report mentions that the Chak Jhumra-Shaheenabad (Sargodha) section was also temporarily closed for the rail traffic on the night of Aug 29, while an exceptionally high flood damaged bridge No 132 & 134 near Chiniot. The efforts are underway to repair/reconstruct the bridge to restore the train operation on this section, it adds.
Similarly, it says, the Wazirabad-Sialkot section has also closed since Sept 3 due to flooding and rain, allowing water to overtop the track between the Wazirabad–Sodhra Kopra section.
Allama Iqbal Express also faced detention for two hours due to flooding. The Jhang-Shaheenabad section has also been closed following flooding in the area since Aug 28, after the flood caused
breaching
near Rivaz Railway Bridge over the river Chanab. The floodwater is still passing through the breached section, as the train traffic remains suspended.
The report further says that the Khanewal-Shorkot section is also closed since Sept 3, as the rail traffic was put on hold on this section due to high flood levels at Abdul Hakim Bridge No 27 at Railway km 36/10-14 and due to breaches at KM. 41/13-14, 42/13-14 & 43/01 on Sept 4 between Abdul Hakim-Darkana stations.
The flood situation has also caused temporary disruptions in the train operations at the Shahdra-Faisalabad section due to the cutting of an embankment at bridge No 10 last month. The trains are passing through this section with a restricted speed limit.
The report says that at the Lahore-Badami Bagh section, a tree fell on the track, causing the detention of Tezgam Express for 50 minutes, last month. The rail traffic also faced disruption at the Uggoki-Sialkot section last month after the floodwater overtopped the track by 12 inches, resulting in a 2-hour and 20-minute detention of the Sialkot Express.
At the Port Qasim-Bin Qasim rail section, the track faced blockage of trains for 12 hours due to a breach on both sides on Aug 20. The Kotri-Dadu section also remained blocked for three hours on Aug 20 due to boulder and mud sliding, the report adds.
It says that the Tando Adam-Hyderabad section also remained closed for freight train operations due to the accumulation of water in the Hyderabad yard for 15 hours on August 22. Likewise, the Peshawar Saddar-Cant section also remained closed for around two hours due to urban flooding in Peshawar on Aug 18.
Meanwhile, Lesco is also facing damage to its supply system in various parts of its jurisdiction, which comprises Lahore, Kasur, Nankana, Okara and Sheikhupura districts.
Due to the floods, as many as 67 11kV feeders were affected. Of these, 55 have been re-energised. “As many as 73,724 consumers suffered power disruptions, and of them, 13,073 are still without electricity. In Kasur and Okara, precious material (cables) and power infrastructure were affected by the floods, whereas Lahore’s various parts also faced issues.
“The floods have affected our infrastructure. But our teams worked day and night to restore power supply to the flood-affected areas. Still, 17 per cent of the total 73,724 consumers are affected,” Lesco Chief Executive Officer Ramzan Butt said in a statement.
There are also reports of massive losses in the areas of Gepco, Multan Electric Power Company (Mepco) and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco).
“In Bajwat, a rural area of Sialkot, the residents of 85 villages are without electricity since Aug 26,” an official told

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942828/maritime-plan-positions-gwadar-as-regional-hub,Maritime plan positions Gwadar as regional hub - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has reaffirmed its focus on integrating the New Gwadar International Airport with the port as part of the five-year Maritime Affairs Action Plan (2025-2029), aiming to transform Gwadar into a regional trade and transit hub.
The commitment was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Wednesday. The plan, aligned with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), seeks to enhance maritime cooperation with
China
while promoting economic connectivity with Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
The framework emphasises infrastructure development, including the
expansion
of Gwadar Port, completion of Free Zone Stage II, and acceleration of East Bay Expressway Phase II to improve inland accessibility. A key component is the integration of the airport with the port to support multi-modal transit and regional logistics.
The plan also supports the adoption of electronic data interchange systems and smart port technologies to integrate Gwadar with Chinese and international shipping networks. Development of port-related industries, cold storage facilities, and warehousing is part of the strategy to facilitate transshipment and regional trade.
Govt plans strategic leap with port and airport integration
Beyond logistics, the framework outlines initiatives for scientific cooperation, industrial development, and maritime tourism. Proposed projects include joint marine science research centres, CPEC-linked industrial parks for fisheries, shipbuilding and aquaculture, as well as tourism ventures along Balochistan’s coast.
Education and human resource development are positioned as cross-cutting priorities, with proposed academic partnerships and training exchanges between Pakistani and Chinese institutions to develop skilled manpower in logistics, port management, and fisheries.
The plan aligns with the Belt and Road Initiative’s “green energy and ocean” objectives, emphasising sustainable use of marine resources and environmental protection. The minister stated that the 2025-2029 action plan reflects Pakistan’s commitment to building a resilient maritime economy and strengthening strategic maritime ties with China under the CPEC framework.

floods
in Pakistan have struck both the rural heartland and industrial centres for the first time in decades, causing billions of dollars in damage while straining food supplies, exports and a fragile economic recovery.
The government had been optimistic about 2026, pencilling in 4.2% growth on the back of a rebound in farming and manufacturing after the economy was stabilised under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout.
Instead, record monsoon rains since late June,
amplified
by dam releases from India, have submerged large swathes of Punjab and Sindh.
While waters have yet to recede in many districts, officials and analysts warn the hit could be deeper than in 2022, when a third of the country lay under water, due to dual shocks to agriculture and manufacturing.
Out on the plains, satellite images have traced the scale. A report from agricultural monitoring initiative GEOGLAM estimates at least 220,000 hectares of rice fields flooded between August 1 and September 16.
In Punjab, 1.8 million acres of farmland have been inundated, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority.
“About 50% of rice, and 60% of cotton and maize crops have been damaged,” said Khalid Bath, chairman of the Pakistan Farmers Association.
He said losses could exceed 2.5 million acres, worth up to Rs1 trillion.
“This is unlike anything we have seen in recent decades,” said Iqrar Ahmad Khan, former vice chancellor of the University of Agriculture Faisalabad.
He estimates at least a tenth of the country’s crops are destroyed, with vegetable losses topping 90% in some districts.
The timing is perilous: Pakistan is about to sow wheat, the crop that provides nearly half of the country’s caloric intake. National reserves remain comfortable after a strong 2024 harvest, according to Crop Monitor, but the sowing window is at risk in fields still slick with silt and mud.
“Food insecurity is coming, not just higher prices,” Khan warned.
Underplaying risks
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal acknowledged the floods would “set back” GDP growth and said a clearer damage tally would be ready in about two weeks.
The country’s central bank said the deluge would cause a “temporary yet significant supply shock,” and it put growth near the lower end of its 3.25–4.25% range.
It argued the shock would be less severe than the $30 billion
disaster
in 2022, with stronger forex reserves and lower interest rates offering some resilience.
But prices for wheat, sugar, onions and tomatoes have jumped, pushing a sensitive price index to a 26‑month high.
IMF resident representative Mahir Binici said an upcoming review of the Extended Fund Facility this week will assess whether the 2026 fiscal year budget and emergency provisions can meet the nation’s needs. Iqbal called on the fund to “help us mitigate the damages”.
Some economists say policymakers are underplaying the risks.
“The floods will increase the current account deficit by $7 billion. They are worse than the previous floods,” former finance minister Hafeez Pasha said.
Counting losses
In industrial cities such as Sialkot — a hub for the textiles, sporting goods and surgical equipment that underpin Pakistan’s exports - several workshops were marooned.
The hit to agriculture is also a blow for manufacturers. Industrialists say cotton shortfalls will ripple into the textile sector, the country’s top foreign exchange earner, while rice exporters warn Pakistan risks losing competitiveness to India as prices rise.
“We had 400 acres of cotton, but only 90 are left,” farmer Rab Nawaz said, near the city of Multan.
At least 1,006 people have been killed since June 26, the National Disaster Management Authority said, while over 2.5 million people have been evacuated in Punjab and Sindh.
In Lahore, homes and small businesses were gutted.
Mohammad Arif, a 50 year old rickshaw driver and father of five, said he moved his vehicle to higher ground as his home was inundated.

• Aleema Khan asks who is pressuring judiciary, alleges case is being ‘deliberately delayed’
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday adjourned the hearing of petitions filed by former PM Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, seeking
suspension
of their sentence in the
£190 million reference
until Oct 16 due to the absence of NAB’s special prosecutor.
Meanwhile, speaking to reporters outside the court, PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan and KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur alleged that hearing of cases was deliberately being delayed, urging the judiciary to reveal that who is pressurising it.
The case was taken up by a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sar­fraz Dogar and Justice Muham­mad Azam Khan.
At the outset of the hearing, PTI’s lawyers raised objections over the difficulties faced by counsel and supporters in accessing the courtroom.
They argued that the unnecessary deployment of security men and fencing outside the court created hindrances, des­pite no history of law-and-order issues during previous hearings. Barrister Salman Safdar contended that the court had been approached on multiple occasi­ons without any disruption.
Responding to the grievances, CJ Dogar apologised to the defence counsel and assured them that the court would not allow such obstacles in the fut­ure. “This is your court, come whenever you want,” he remarked, instructing the auth­orities to ensure smooth access for legal representatives and litigants.
NAB prosecutor Rafay Maqsood then infor­med the bench that the special prosecutor in the case was seriously ill and unable to appear. This led Barrister Safdar to accuse NAB of deliberately employing delaying tactics.
Media talk
Speaking to the media after the hearing, PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan said the
Toshakhana-2
case was being heard in Adi­a­­la Jail and, according to lawyer Salman Saf­d­­ar, the matter would be decided in two or three hearings and Imran Khan would be punished.
“On the other hand, for the last 10 months we have been trying to get a hearing date from the Islamabad High Court. After sitting for hours in Justice Dogar’s secretary’s room, we obtained a date of Sept 25 and now the next date has been fixed for Oct 16. While the
cipher case
was being heard by the IHC, it was listed daily. Now why are such long intervals being given? Is the case being delayed so that the Toshakhana-2 case can be decided?” she asked.
She claimed it was obvious the judge was deliberately delaying the matter, since a date in first week of October could have been given.
“Imran also said that Gen Asim Munir cannot stop him from posting on social media. He said the account belongs to him and he will not be dictated to by Asim Munir,” Ms Khan said.
On the occasion, KP CM Gandapur alleged that the actions in Imran Khan’s case were pre-planned.

meeting
with Muslim leaders in Washington earlier this week where the American head of the state presented his plan to end Israel’s invasion of Gaza.
“We fully participated in the meeting on Gaza, and God willing, its encouraging results will come out soon,” he said, flanked by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar while addressing overseas Pakistanis at the High Commission in London.
According to state broadcaster
Radio Pakistan
, he also said that Pakistan was also part of Trump-led efforts to bring peace to Palestine and end oppression against the people of Gaza.
The premier also expressed distress over the situation in Gaza, which has been subjected to Israeli onslaught since October 2023, and prayed that the cruelty and barbarity being witnessed there ends soon.
Trump’s meeting with Muslim leaders on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York had brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, and Indonesia.
Ahead of formal consultations, Trump told his guests: “We have to get the hostages back … This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world … so it’s an honour to be with you.”
Trump also emphasised the urgency of ending the conflict: “We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started.”
According to reports from Israel’s
Channel 12
and US-based
Axios
, President Trump’s plan envisions an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages, both alive and deceased; phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza
Governance excluding Hamas but incorporating the Palestinian Authority; deployment of Arab and Muslim peacekeepers to secure Gaza and facilitate Israel’s withdrawal; and internationally supported reconstruction and transition programmes funded by regional contributors.
These details were reportedly shared with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though Israel did not draft the plan.
Dar, who also attended the meeting with Trump, also expressed the hope for positive outcomes of the meeting, saying that once these results materialised, “we will share them with the nation”.
He also said that follow-up communications after the meeting were going on until last night.
Earlier during the talk, PM Shehbaz also referred to his engagements in New York, where he led Pakistan’s delegation to the UNGA’s 80th session. He said his speech at the UNGA was a reflection of the sentiments of Pakistanis and that he fought the case of India-occupied Kashmir there.
The PM also touched upon his bilateral meeting with Trump in Washington during the recent US trip, saying that it was a “productive” and “constructive” engagement.

• Putin urges shift from ‘Euro-centric’ security model
• Tianjin Declaration condemns terror attacks in Pakistan; reaffirms commitment to fight separatism and extremism
ISLAMABAD: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday pressed his vision for a new global security and economic order that prioritises the “Global South”, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif
called on
leaders of the
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
(SCO) to initiate a structured process to resolve
longstanding disputes
in South Asia.
“Global governance has reached a new crossroads,” said President Xi, adding that member states “must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics, and practise true multilateralism” — a thinly veiled swipe at the US.
The summit brought together more than 20 world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Indian PM Narendra Modi, in the Chinese port city of Tianjin.
In an image designed to convey a mood of solidarity, Putin and Modi were shown holding hands as they walked jovially towards Xi before the summit opened. The three men stood shoulder-to-shoulder, laughing and surrounded by interpreters.
“It’s hard to tell if the scene was choreographed or improvised, but it doesn’t really matter,” wrote Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of
The China-Global South Project
, a research agency.
Putin, whose country has forged even closer economic and security ties with China amid the fallout from the Ukraine war, said the SCO had revived “genuine multilateralism”, with national currencies increasingly used in mutual settlements.
“This, in turn, lays the political and socio-economic groundwork for the formation of a new system of stability and security in Eurasia,” Putin said.
“This security system, unlike Euro-centric and Euro-Atlantic models, would genuinely consider the interests of a broad range of countries, be truly balanced, and would not allow one country to ensure its own security at the expense of others.”
Xi also called for the creation of a new SCO development bank, in what would be a major step towards the bloc’s long-held aspiration of developing an alternative payment system that circumvents the US dollar and the power of its sanctions.
Call for S. Asia dialogue
Addressing the 25th SCO Heads of States Council meeting, PM Shehbaz also made Pakistan’s case for normal and stable relations with its neighbours, advocating dialogue over confrontation.
“Pakistan has always believed in the power of multilateralism, dialogue and diplomacy, and shunning unilateralism,” he said, expressing disappointment over the region’s extremely disturbing development in the last few months.
Highlighting Pakistan’s support for multilateralism, the prime minister said the SCO remained a platform that best represents Pakistan’s abiding commitment to regional cooperation and integration.
On regional security, the prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s condemnation of terrorism in all its forms, including what he termed “state terrorism,” while recalling the country’s immense sacrifices in the fight against extremism.
“We have lost over 90,000 lives and endured economic losses exceeding $152 billion — a sacrifice unparalleled in history,” he said, adding that foreign elements were involved in recent terror incidents in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“We condemn terrorism in all its forms… Those who have long used terrorism for advancing their political interest must know that the world no longer buys this narrative. We had irrefutable evidence of the involvement of some foreign hands in the devastating Jaffar Express train hostage incident as well as countless other terrorist attacks against us in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the PM remarked.
The prime minister also strongly condemned Israel’s unjustified aggression against Iran, a fellow SCO member, and called for an immediate end to the bloodshed in Gaza. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the two-state solution with pre-1967 borders and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as the capital of Palestine.
He said Pakistan supports a peaceful and stable Afghanistan for the benefit of the entire region, expressing that hope that trilateral cooperation between Pakistan, China and Afghanistan would yield positive results. Addressing the challenge of climate-induced disasters, the prime minister spoke about the devastating floods currently affecting Pakistan due to torrential rains, which have caused massive human and economic losses. He thanked the international community, particularly China, for their solidarity and assistance.
Tianjin Declaration
The summit adopted the Tianjin Declaration, which notably stated: “Member states strongly condemned the
terrorist attack
in Pahalgam on April 22, 2025. Member states also strongly condemned the terrorist attacks on
Jaffar Express
on March 11 and in Khuzdar on May 21, 2025.”
The SCO leaders expressed their “deepest sympathy and condolences” to the families of the dead and the wounded, saying that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice.
“The member states, while reaffirming their firm commitment to the fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, stress the inadmissibility of attempts to use terrorist, separatist and extremist groups for mercenary purposes.
They recognise the leading role of sovereign states and their competent authorities in countering terrorist and extremist threats,” the declaration said.
It added that the SCO members were committed to ensuring sustainable international peace and called for joint efforts to counter traditional and new security challenges and threats.
It said that they reaffirmed their determination to continue the joint fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, as well as against the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors, arms smuggling and other forms of transnational organised crime.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945140/shaping-of-pak-us-ties,Shaping of Pak-US ties - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"PRIME Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir’s
meeting
with American President Donald Trump will continue to echo for weeks, perhaps months.
The US president’s continuous engagement with Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership is being framed as a signal of a broader policy shift in Washington, one that touches the Middle East, South Asia and, most critically, America’s approach to China and India. Pakistan, for its part, has accepted a role in this evolving order, though uncertainty lingers over what shape it will ultimately take.
Analysts continue to speculate, but the specifics of Pakistan’s emerging role are unclear. What is evident, however, is Islamabad’s agility in sensing Washington’s shifting policy mood and recalibrating its own position accordingly. In recent months, Pakistan has faced a tense
stand-off
with India, ongoing instability in Afghanistan, the war in Ukraine and China’s expanding global influence, all of which have reshaped the strategic landscape. Amid these disruptions, Pakistan has repositioned itself to remain relevant.
In this shifting context, Pakistan has regained sudden importance not as a client state, nor as a conventional security one, and certainly not as a functioning democracy, but as a flexible idea state. Despite its fragile economy, weak institutions and a self-serving elite, it continues to navigate regional and global politics with surprising dexterity, maintaining a precarious balance among adversaries. Its willingness to engage any power that recognises its potential, primarily in defence, minerals and natural resources, has become its main bargaining leverage. The ability to reposition itself in turbulent times has long defined Pakistan’s survival strategy.
Managing this balance is not easy for a medium-sized state with two powerful neighbours — one an outright adversary, the other a partner sensitive to Islamabad’s other alignments. Pakistan also has to maintain its balance vis-à-vis two other states with competing ideological and political priorities, reinforced by their influence within Pakistan’s religious communities, where they are perceived as friends or foes. Yet, Pakistan has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to coexist with these contradictions and utilise them to its advantage.
The specifics of Pakistan’s emerging role are unclear.
This outlook was recently captured by Pakist­an’s defence minister, who credited the ‘hybrid’ nature of the state for soothing US-Pakistan relations. The term, often invoked by both civilian and military leaders to describe their domestic arrangement, has now extended into foreign policy.
Pakistan, in effect, has become a hedging state: one that cultivates ties with competing powers, avoids overdependence on any single actor and keeps its strategic options open. However, unlike other hedging states, Pakistan’s version is driven by its hybrid security structure, where security imperatives dominate politics and governance, intelligence agencies wield disproportionate influence and foreign policy is shaped more by the logic of threat and survival than a long-term vision.
A state with such credentials can do business even with its adversaries if it sees an advantage. Turkiye, Egypt, Qatar and Azerbaijan share similar traits, maintaining relations with powers that are often at odds with each other. Yet Pakistan’s case remains distinctive; its hybrid regime not only practises this flexibility but openly frames it as a strength. Islamabad has never hesitated to initiate dialogue with India when expedient, though the driving motive has consistently been elite survival and consolidation, rather than a coherent long-term state strategy.
These very credentials — the ability to navigate contradictions, recalibrate under pressure and conduct business even with adversaries — appear to have inspired Washington to enter yet another phase of partnership with Pakistan, despite the bitter legacies of counterterrorism cooperation and the Afghan war.
The warming ties reflect a convergence of pragmatic needs on both sides: for the US, in line with its interests in the region, counterterrorism, trade and mineral investments; for Pakistan, economic relief, strategic recognition and reaffirmation of its indispensability. Trump’s willingness to personally
host
Pakistan’s military leadership at the White House, alongside meetings with Prime Minister Sharif, underscores Washington’s acknowledgement of the hybrid structure of power in Islamabad.
For Pakistan’s elites, the revival of this partnership is less about a coherent long-term strategy and more about leveraging US interests in the region to consolidate their own political and economic standing, while keeping open channels with China, the Gulf states and even India when expedient.
What, then, are America’s regional interests in West and South Asia? Analysts have listed several. In the Middle East, Washington’s priorities range from advancing the Abraham Accords, this time with Saudi Arabia, and potentially Pakistan, on board if there is to be regime change in Iran, in support of President Trump’s new peace roadmap on Palestine, which Prime Minister Sharif seems to have publicly endorsed after he met the American leader and other Muslim leaders in New York, where the UN General Assembly is underway.
In South Asia, the US appears focused on containing India, at least temporarily, by partnering with Pakistan on common objectives in Afghanistan, and most importantly, pulling Islamabad back from Beijing’s orbit, a move that could unsettle China, which has long viewed Pakistan as its most reliable ally.
Geo-economics further complicates this web of regional objectives. A race for mineral and energy resources, most visibly between the US and China, is already underway, and for Pakistan, this competition presents an attractive space for collaboration. Yet the real question is which of these objectives Pakistan can genuinely help Washington achieve, and for how long. What would be the nature of the relationship if the US were to meet its goals at a desirable level?
Does Pakistan have the capacity to sustain meaningful engagement with the US in economic and defence cooperation, the outcome Rawalpindi most desires over the long term, and at what cost? These questions will continue to shape the debate in the weeks ahead, surfacing in varying contexts as the partnership is tested.

campaign
against dengue mosquito larvae.
He asked the authority not to spare the relevant Deputy District Health Officers (DDHOs) as they kept issuing salaries to them without keeping an eye on their work.
A senior official of the district health authority told
Dawn
that during checking, the Punjab Information and Technology Board (PITB) teams found more than 200 employees absent from duties on the field and were drawing salaries and would send their photos, which they had taken during previous campaigns, to PITB as proof on a daily basis.
Their activities have left the anti-dengue drive a useless exercise as the number of dengue patients kept increasing with each passing day, he said.
DC orders action under Punjab employees accountability act
He said that some officials were not present in the field but were drawing salaries from the health authority. He said that a list of the employees had been prepared and sent to provincial government for necessary action.
He said that the third-party audit of the dengue campaign had been started in all the union councils, and it was expected that the performance of the officials would be checked on regular basis.
In 2025, so far 281 dengue patients reported in the district, while last year the number of patients was 210 only till September 11.
On Thursday, 17 dengue patients were reported in the Rawalpindi district, while 67 dengue patients are in the hospitals. These patients arrived from Kotha Kalan, Qayumabad, Saidpur Scheme, Satellite Town D-Block, Saddar, Tench Bhatta, Shakriayal, Dhamial, Asghar Mall Scheme and Dhoke Dalal.
Meanwhile, the health officials’ misappropriation was discussed in the meeting of the District Emergency and Response Committee with Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema in the chair.
It was decided in the meeting that strict action will be taken against the officials involved in fake activities as well as the DDHOs issuing salaries to them.
The meeting was attended by Health, Education, WASA and other relevant departmental senior officials. District Health Officials gave a detailed briefing to the meeting on the performance of the anti-dengue campaign so far and the steps taken.
Speaking on the occasion, the Deputy Commissioner said that all departments should play a proactive role in the field regarding the prevention of dengue in Rawalpindi. Along with intensive monitoring of public places, educational institutions, hospitals and hotspots, no negligence will be tolerated in the destruction of dengue larvae.
He said that government officials engaged in fake activities and those absent from duty will be dismissed immediately.
“Action will be taken against such officials under the PEDA Act who have taken salaries but have not worked. Action will also be taken against DDHOs who have issued salaries to officials engaged in fake activities.
According to PITB reports, so far, about 200 officials have been identified who were absent from duty or were engaged in fake activities. Officials of all departments were directed to conduct daily field visits and submit their performance reports. Declaring the anti-dengue campaign a national duty, it was decided to further intensify the public awareness campaign.
Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema clarified that such government officials who are negligent on a sensitive issue like the protection of public lives do not deserve any concession. A zero-tolerance policy will be adopted in the anti-dengue campaign to keep citizens safe from the disease, he said.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the IBO was carried out on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to
Fitna al Hindustan
.
The state uses the term
Fitna al Khwarij
to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as
Fitna-al-Hindustan
to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” said the ISPR.
The statement added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the dead terrorists, who remained actively involved in terrorist activities in the area.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the ISPR said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi commended the security forces for the successful operation.
“Pakistan’s security forces thwarted the nefarious designs of Indian-backed terrorists,” he wrote on X. “I pay tribute to the security forces for their successful operation against Indian-sponsored terrorists.”
A day prior, security forces
killed
19 terrorists in three separate operations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to an ISPR statement.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943714/buscaro-raises-2m-to-tackle-tricky-mobility-sector,BusCaro raises $2m to tackle tricky mobility sector - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Venture capital is starting to trickle back into Pakistan. In the latest round, mobility startup BusCaro raised $2 million last week, bringing its total funding to $3.5m.
The round was led by UAE-based Daman Investments, with participation from US/Saudi Cartography Capital, New York’s Epic Angest, UK’s Wahed Ventures, the Aga Khan Development Network’s Accelerate Prosperity, and a mix of angel investors.
BusCaro, which offers shared commute services, was born in late 2022 — a time that could not have been less propitious for mobility startups. The world was emerging from the pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war had triggered a global crisis, Pakistan was reeling from floods, and the local mobility sector was collapsing. Airlift and Swvl had folded, and Uber had exited Pakistan. What was once the hottest space had suddenly become a no-go zone.
That’s when Maha Shahzad, former general manager of Swvl, launched BusCaro — putting its first bus on the road just a day after Swvl shut down.
The journey since then has been anything but smooth. Ms Shahzad says she received over 400 rejections before securing the game-changing $160,000 in the first year of operations that set the fledgling startup on its current growth path. Today, BusCaro claims to process more than 900,000 monthly bookings and is on track to hit $8.6m in annual revenue by December. But scaling up has brought its own financial headaches.
The financing conundrum
“Equity financing is the least of my problems — and that’s true for most founders,” says Ms Shahzad. “Working capital is the main bottleneck.”
BusCaro operates an asset-light, tech-first model: it doesn’t own vehicles, operates out of co-working space Collabs, and has no land or collateral to borrow against. Its topline is too large to qualify as a small or medium enterprise, and even if it did, the Rs5m lending cap would be far too little. As a result, BusCaro is forced to turn towards venture for day-to-day financing.
“Startups raise equity to fuel high-octane growth. It’s ridiculous that we need to raise it for working capital,” Ms Shahzad says. Despite being fully incorporated, with a strong credit history, a portfolio of formal clients willing to provide guarantees, and credit lines from major fuel companies such as Total and Parco, BusCaro still struggles to raise financing against its invoices, underscoring the challenges faced by the tech-based private sector.
Getting the model right
So what is BusCaro doing differently, where others with deeper pockets failed?
The steep hike in petroleum prices, the economic downturn, and the drying up of global financing made it impossible to sustain business models like Airlift and Swvl’s, which prized growth over profitability by subsidising services. When the economic tides turned worldwide, venture capitalists were no longer handing out blank cheques for costly customer acquisition; instead, they required startups to prioritise early breakeven over just chasing revenue growth.
However, according to BusCaro, it secured positive unit economics from the outset — in simple terms, each ride cost less to provide than the revenue earned from fares. And while its fares are correlated to fuel prices, a shared commute remains cheaper than a solo ride.
Unlike its predecessors, BusCaro has not subsidised its per-seat fare. This balance was achieved by driving aggregation across two verticals: business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C).
On the B2B side, BusCaro partners with institutions. Sometimes, employers subsidise a percentage of the commute cost as an employee perk; in other cases, BusCaro provides the option of shared transport if enough employees aggregate demand.
For B2B2C, it works with facilitators like housing societies or co-working spaces to pool commuters at pick-up points. This approach slashes customer acquisition costs and creates positive unit economics. With 80 clients onboard, about 60pc of BusCaro’s business comes from B2B, and 40pc from B2B2C, including its parent-facing app.
That app has also opened up a niche market: school commutes. A couple of decades ago, school vans were everywhere; today, parents are left scrambling for reliable options. BusCaro’s app enables parents and schools to track rides in real-time, with manual check-in and check-out options for minors. It’s a problem, Ms Shahzad believes, that has significant potential — not just in Pakistan, but across the GCC, especially for working mothers.
Startup burn
Not that BusCaro is profitable. Currently, it burns about $15,000 a month, with a -2.8 per cent EBITDA [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation] — almost entirely due to additional tech spend. With Ms Shahzad mentioning the 36pc interest rate BusCaro has faced, the debt financing alone would add up to a hefty expense, pushing the bottom line deeper into the red — a problem that eventually led its previous cohort to their exit.
But demand is outpacing supply. “My pipeline is 5x to 6x more than what I can fulfil right now,” Ms Shahzad claims. And the logic seems simple: shared commute outside of public transport will always be the cheapest way to move people. However, for the bottom line to come out of the red, the company will need a topline growth of 28pc.
From non-air-conditioned 80-seater buses to air-conditioned Corollas, BusCaro offers options across price points, with an average blended fare of Rs130 per ride — more economical than most alternatives. It currently operates in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and nearby cities.
Safety has also been a differentiator, BusCaro claims. With nearly 19m bookings since its inception, BusCaro claims zero reported harassment cases. The nature of shared rides, where 70pc of passengers are women and children, inherently lowers the risk, although the company also vets its drivers.
While speaking to
Dawn
, Ms Shahzad has a simple piece of advice for startups struggling to raise capital: don’t get caught up in FOMO. “A few years ago, everyone was rushing into fintech. Now it’s AI. Instead, solve the boring problems on the ground — and do it while staying unit positive.”",2025-09-22,Fatima S Attarwala,1540,0.000175

On September 25, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had
addressed
a UNSC session on artificial intelligence. However, photos from his speech had spread like wildfire on social media platform X as users had pointed to Junejo sitting in the background and
shared
several screenshots from her Twitter (now X) timeline from several years ago, expressing support for Israel.
Following social media furore, Asif said on X that Junejo’s presence at the session was at the FO’s discretion. For its part, the FO clarified that she was not listed in the official letter of credence for the Pakistan delegation to the 80th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session.
The matter came up during
Geo News
programme ‘Naya Pakistan’ today, where Asif was asked whether he was “taken aback” by the FO’s statement.
“I was taken aback, rather I was a bit disturbed that such people could be with the delegation whom no one owns later,” Asif replied.
He further clarified people getting photographed with him abroad was not unusual and while Junejo, too, had a photograph with him a hotel lobby, he did not know her.
The defence minister reiterated that he was “taken aback” after he saw Junejo with the delegation but he did not ask anyone about her presence.
When asked whether she was Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s speech writer and had written the prime minister’s speech at the UNGA, Asif replied in the negative. He clarified that according to the information he had, Junejo did not have any official position, be it of an adviser or a special assistant.
Asif’s and FO’s clarifications on X
Earlier, Asif had clarified on X that he had given the speech instead of PM Shehbaz at the UNSC session as the latter had other engagements; the premier has been attending the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
“This woman or whoever sat behind me was and is at the discretion of the Foreign Office,” Asif said.
The defence minister said that for the past 60 years, he had an emotional attachment and personal commitment to the Palestine cause. He added that he had Palestinian friends and colleagues while working in Abu Dhabi and was still in contact with them.
“My views on Gaza are clear and I express them openly,” he said, expressing his hatred for Israel and Zionism.
“Who is this woman, why is she with the delegation, and why was she seated behind me? Only the FO can answer these questions. It is not appropriate for me to respond on their behalf,” Asif said.
He said that his account on X was a testament to the fact that his relationship with Palestine was part of his faith.
Subsequently, in a post on X late on Friday night, the FO said that it had noted the queries regarding “the seating of a certain individual behind the defence minister at a recent meeting of the UNSC”. The FO did not explicitly name Junejo.
“To clarify, the individual in question was not listed in the official letter of credence for the Pakistan delegation to the 80th UNGA session, signed by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister,” it said.
“As such, her seating behind the defence minister did not have the approval of the deputy prime minister/foreign minister,” it added.
Meanwhile, Junejo also took to X and posted screenshots of previous posts where she had called out Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
“Youthias are calling me a Zionist when for the past two years I have tweeted about Gaza almost daily, calling [Israeli PM] Netanyahu a war criminal and showing Israeli atrocities,” she said.
The term “youthia” is a derogatory term commonly used as a slur for PTI supporters.
“Once again, this entire campaign has been launched against me because they only fear me,” she said.
Uproar
Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari had stated that one could not sit behind a minister in the UNSC or the United Nations General Assembly unless they were identified as an official representative of the government.
“So who allowed this to happen and why? Is there a covert policy agenda at work viz rogue entity Israel, Bagram base, Abraham Accords? GoP needs to come clean — who is responsible?” she asked.
Mehlaqa Samdani, the director of the Community Alliance For Peace and Justice, said: “To include Shama Junejo, who champions a pro-Israel and pro-normalisation agenda, in Pakistan’s
#UNGA
delegation is not a good look for Pakistan.”
Meanwhile, journalist Ahmad Noorani said that questioning Junejo’s patriotism or “branding her ‘pro-Israel’ over her views on diplomacy is disgraceful”.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945081/muttahida-demands-implementation-of-karachi-master-plan,Muttahida demands implementation of Karachi master plan - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Saturday lashed out at the Sindh government over Karachi’s civic issues, demanding that the federal government use constitutional provisions to force the provincial government to urgently implement the
Karachi Strategic Development Plan (KSDP) 2020.
Addressing a press conference, party leader Haider Abbas Rizvi accused the provincial government of intentionally discarding the KSDP -2020 and wasting trillions meant for development projects, labelling the government “a national criminal”.
He said that the federal government should invoke Article 149, which grants it certain powers to issue directives to the provincial government to ensure compliance with federal policies or laws.
The KSDP-2020 was prepared by the Master Plan Group of Offices (MPGO) and the City District Government Karachi (CDGK) to make the Karachi a world-class city and an attractive economic centre with a decent quality of life for Karachiites.
The MQM-P leader said that KSDP-2020, unanimously approved by the then city’s elected government and gazetted in 2020 by the Supreme Court’s Water Commission, was deliberately discarded by the Sindh government.
“Now, claims are being made that Karachi lacks a master plan, whereas a new, fabricated plan is being devised to further stall the city’s development,” he added.
He also demanded that the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act 2017 initiate an investigation into those responsible, including government members and officials, for not implementing the KSDP 2020, and that those found guilty be punished.
Flanked by party lawmakers from the Sindh and National assemblies, he stated that the Sindh government was “infringing upon the basic rights of Karachi’s residents, exploiting them relentlessly”.
Mr Rizvi said that the city, which contributed over “70 per cent” of Pakistan’s revenue and “98pc” of Sindh’s, was “being crushed by the dumper mafia”.
“Over 600 lives were lost last year, rains flooded the city, sewers overflowed, diseases spread, yet the rulers claimed everything was fine,” he deplored.
He said Karachi’s residents had been buying water for 20 years, children “lacked access” to basic vaccines, and the Sindh government had “mismanaged billions” meant for rabies vaccination.
“The city’s roads are unusable, vehicles become unroadworthy within three years, and corruption has ruined key infrastructure like Shahrah Bhutto, University Road, Hub Canal, and Karimabad Underpass,” he said, adding that street crime was rampant, with over “54,000” incidents reported last year, but the provincial government remained inactive, allegedly complicit with the mafia.
MQM-P Senator Khalida Ateeb, MNAs Ahmed Saleem Siddiqui, Sabheen Ghauri and Rana Ansar, and MPAs Abdul Waseem, Mazahir Amir, Jamal Ahmed, Dr Abdul Basit, Ijazul Haq, Adil Askari, Faisal Rafique, Rana Shaukat, Farah Sohail, Bilqis Mukhtar, and Quratul Ain were also present on the occasion.

To make themselves small. To cause little havoc when offering opinions outside the narrow fields deemed acceptable — education, medicine, caretaking.
But the world has taught us something the hard way: silence does not bring peace either.
There is an African proverb: “If your mother doesn’t teach you something, the world will.”
And the world is teaching us women, again and again, that the system is not built to listen to us, especially not when we speak with force, confidence, and independence.
A clash in the courtroom
Consider Imaan Mazari, a human rights lawyer in Pakistan, unapologetically outspoken in a courtroom that too often doubles as a boys’ club. Last week, she
faced
Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, a man entrusted with upholding dignity through the rule of law, who instead subjected her to humiliation.
In open court, Justice Dogar told Mazari to shut her mouth (
moun band rakho
). He threatened physical violence (
jiss din maine pakar lia
). He told her husband to rein her in, as if she were a farm animal, the ward of some guardian rather than a full constitutional citizen.
This is not an offhand slight. Neither is it a one-off offence. Justice Dogar has a
pattern
of dismissing her with comments like, “Why are you so stubborn?” — targeting her person instead of her arguments. But this recent outburst crosses into much darker terrain.
When the moral custodian of a legal system speaks to a woman this way, the insult ricochets beyond one courtroom. It lands on every woman who has ever been told to sit down, lower her voice, stay in her place. Or else.
Often, the men threatening women are vagabonds of some sort. We are all reeling because this comes from a man that the vagabonds should fear.
We have all been told that courtrooms are no place for a woman. But we should not have to hear that from the very people tasked with our protection.
No, we don’t want to leave.
When confronted by women’s groups, Justice Dogar
insisted
his words to Imaan were gracious, merely meant to scold a child. But even by that framing, it reflects a troubling paternalism — one that women have long been forced to resist.
We want to stand up to our uncles, our fathers, our make-shift fathers; the whole lot.
To deny a woman’s intelligence is a form of violence. To neglect her educational expertise is a form of violence.
A legacy of resistance
Imaan Mazari is not small. She stands in a lineage of women like Asma Jahangir — the iconic Pakistani lawyer and activist who fought for those buried under patriarchy and state violence. The world finds it easier to dignify Jahangir now that she is gone. Mazari, alive and forceful, is harder to dismiss. Young, sharp, blisteringly defiant; she is a blinding force field in a landscape still upheld by men who prefer obedience. She prefers equality.
They have tried to punish her before — locking her in jail without the medication she needs to keep her kidneys functioning, counting on her dignity to fracture. She walked out of prison with her head still high. That, too, is why they fear her.
The broader context
What Mazari faced fits within a much larger story. In Pakistan, women’s rights are not merely curtailed — they are structurally undermined.
Marital rape
is effectively legal.
Honour killings
persist. Child marriage is jealously
defended
by powerful religious institutions. Rape survivors are disbelieved and humiliated. Women’s testimony still counts for half a man’s in court.
Mukhtaran Mai. Noor Mukadam. Dr Mahrang Baloch, Imaan’s client, whom she was representing in court the day she was asked to shut up.
Imagine living under laws that over-legislate your existence, simultaneously fearing you, and pitying you, reducing you to a reproductive vessel. If a woman were a car, to use one analogy, she would be denied headlights and an engine — deliberately mutilated.
In that context, every insult hurled at a lawyer like Mazari carries disproportionate weight. Because if the lawyers are silenced, what chance do their clients, the poor, the vulnerable, the disappeared, ever have?
So no. The kind of compliance needed from women in our country is not the nation-building kind of woman our founding mothers were. Imaan is a mouth on legs, and if you ask me, that is far more judge-like than the people she calls “my lord”.
The moral choice
This is not just Pakistan’s story. It is a universal story about how patriarchies function, how power defaults to diminishing women, how “everyday sexism” provides cover for systems of slavery, casteism, ownership, and silencing.
Imaan Mazari knew Justice Dogar’s words were not just outbursts; they were claims to authority. She knew they must be resisted. By calling him out publicly on her social media, she broke the cycle of complicity that silence demands. That act alone is worth celebrating.
Because sexism is not just another side of the story. And respect — in law, as in life — must be earned.
What comes next
Pakistan can choose differently. It has shown remarkable willpower when it comes to reshaping skylines with housing societies and concrete developments, often for profit. Yet the more urgent task lies in rebuilding the moral and social foundations of the state.
Justice Dogar, too, has choices. He can approach his office as a servant of law, as a reconciler of fractured social trust between genders. He can help build a country where women are treated as equals under justice: citizens, never subjects.
Or he can continue playing the old patriarch, reinforcing the entrenched patterns of authority that rely on diminishing women’s place in public life.
Pakistan’s women already know this much: they have been the invisible half of its economy, its politics, its homes. They have fought, endured, marched, and still received nothing — no capital, no inheritance, no protection. Just marching orders.
That is why, after centuries of silence, they are no longer whispering.

Its effects still echo today - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","It started with the judiciary. Or, at least, what the judiciary was capable of.
Just a few months before they finalised the Constitution on September 21 — that is, 71 years ago this week — Pakistan’s first parliament introduced a safety valve in the system. It was called
writ jurisdiction.
The change didn’t require a lawyer to understand: the superior courts could now issue special orders called writs. These would direct the executive to protect fundamental rights, or restrain it from abusing its powers.
And the House knew a thing or two about such abuse: the year was 1954, and the law — and who got to pass it — was at the heart of democracy’s future. Khwaja Nazimuddin’s ministry had just fallen to the deep state, with battle lines drawn between them: at times dubbed the Bengal and Punjab groups (reductive), or federalists and centralisers (misleading).
Yet the real fight was between the elected and unelected: a forum group versus a fortress group. In fairness, it could well be said that the first was quite capable of excesses, just as the second was of sound decisions. What can’t be said, however, is that both were legitimate.
Ultimately, however, the judiciary would decide that question, the new amendment having boosted its standing. Writs, as
Justice M. R. Kayani told college kids
in Lahore, “are flowers of paradise, and the whole length and breadth of Pakistan is not wide enough to contain their perfume”.
Provided, of course, parliament stood by the judges. “It is the force of opinion which makes good laws,” said Justice Kayani, “and in this particular case, you must pray for the long life of the Bengali members who made the necessary noise.”

Flowers of paradise: the First Amendment
Those noises were originally made in the summer of 1954, when that year’s first amendment to the Government of India Act — Pakistan’s makeshift constitution — brought in writs.
At the centre of attention was legal genius A. K. Brohi, whose own allegiances were a matter of season: too savvy for forum or fortress, Brohi would, at various points in that pitched battle, lean with whoever was ahead.
Writs enabled justice,
he told the assembly,
“far more speedily than by resort to the ordinary procedure”. The high courts would thus become “custodians of the rights of the people”.
A. K. Brohi
Even the opposition’s Dhirendra Nath Datta, of the tragic Pakistan National Congress, agreed. “… The way in which indiscriminate arrests have been made in my province … the morale of the people has been completely broken.” One wonders what Datta would make of terrorism FIRs against protesting lawyers today.
He nonetheless concluded, “I cannot but congratulate the government for introducing a bill like this, which is aimed at safeguarding the interests of the people from the executive
zulm
.”
The first amendment was so passed.
Zulm
, it was hoped, would be made that much harder.
Open to abuse: ‘transferring’ judges
Interestingly, there were also heated debates, over a half-century before Lahore’s Justice Sarfraz Dogar showed up in the Islamabad High Court, on whether or not to pass a law providing for judges being transferred from high court to high court.
Murmurs came from the forum group’s Abdur Rab Nishtar and Mahmud Husain, recently purged from the cabinet in Pakistan’s first coup in 1953 (their removals informed, as cables in London revealed, by hatreds jointly felt by Iskander Mirza and British mandarins).
Nishtar hoped
they could “avoid” such a law altogether: in a federal system, there had to be an autonomous judiciary in all provinces. Otherwise, the law would “give opportunity to a gentleman outside a particular judicial unit to exercise administrative powers”, which might hurt his adopted high court.
Mahmud Husain, too, thought a law meant to secure judicial independence could go wrong if the executive started ping-ponging judges: “It may be under certain circumstances that this power is abused.”
He suggested
such transfer happen only if “the initiative is to come from the judiciary itself”, and on the recommendation of the chief justice of Pakistan.
Left unsaid was what would happen if the chief justice, as well as his judges, were also chosen by the executive — as the 26th Amendment trainwreck now allows.
Reasons to fight
With the power to issue writs in place, the Long Parliament finally took aim at the governor-general, a relentless old man backed by Iskander Mirza’s bureaucrats and Ayub Khan’s generals.
To be sure, the forum group’s humiliations at the hands of the fortress group had been bitter and many: martial law in Lahore, coups in Karachi, and emergency in Dhaka, all within a year.
But the solution, the members knew, could only be through a permanent political settlement — one their departed boss Muhammad Ali Jinnah had promised they would get to write. In sum, democracy, to be delivered via a Fifth Amendment.
Deposed in the first coup: Nazimuddin, Nishtar, Mahmud Husain
Lesser motives varied. The late cabinet’s Nazimuddin and Mahmud Husain, had neither forgiven nor forgotten the governor-general’s purge; they now had their sights on a federal future.
Their rivals in the present cabinet, mostly loath to poke the bear that had selected them, had outliers like Brohi, who saw the advantage of shutting out the gloved hand for good.
Meanwhile, members from East Bengal, like the brash and bold Fazlur Rahman (not to be confused with today’s maulana), were sick of the Punjab gentry’s plans to fuse West Pakistan’s seats into one bloc. If the Bengalis were a majority of the people, then they had to be a majority in parliament.
Self-preservation also played a part: more thuggish members, like Qaiyum Khan, feared PRODA, the anti-corruption law of the time, as a stick the governor-general would soon beat them over the heads with.
Finally, the prime minister and leader of the house, Bogra, hadn’t been told anything by the rebels until right before. He would go along anyway.
Because passing the Constitution, it was thought, could cure such afflictions. In the words of
one bemused British cable
from that month, “The motives which inspire Pakistani politicians are so mixed that it is almost impossible to predict in advance what line they will take”.
All that could be said is “the fact that the new Constitution is now very close”.
September rebels: the governor-general defanged
In the wee hours of September 21, 1954, that new Constitution was given its final touches. By then, the only Leaguers left in the assembly were its 29 supporters, 24 of whom were from outside the Punjab.
Part of the reason this fightback would merit such little coverage was its stodgy authors: League conservatives from East Bengal, Sindh, and today’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in direct opposition to Punjab one-uniters, Bengali nationalists, and the military establishment.
But their Bill from earlier in the day had been explosive: the Fifth Amendment, tabled by Sindh’s M. H. Gazdar, and hurried along by speaker Tamizuddin. The ayes rang out in 10 minutes: the establishment was rebuked, the governor-general’s powers to sack the centre scuppered, and the cabinet made dependent on the assembly’s confidence.
In the September vote, 29 ayes gave the country its first Constitution, to stark opposition from the Pakistan National Congress.
The draft Constitution of 1954 also raised Bengali to a national language, entrusted judicial appointments to the country’s chief justice, and buried One Unit out of hand.
“One can only say to the country that the best has been done,”
closed Brohi,
adding that “posterity alone can be the sole and competent judge.” The Constitution was sent to the printers, to cheers from the press.
“Democracy in Pakistan has come alive,” Dawn said, hailing the “zeal, speed, and determination” of the assembly. After years of heartache, it had fulfilled its mission.
Others weren’t so enthused: upon hearing the news, London sweated that the forum crew would ditch the Western alliance; that they might reject the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (Seato) and even step out of the Commonwealth. Punjab’s landed gentry wept at having to concede the Bengalis their majority. And future field marshal Ayub likened the whole session to a murder in the night.
Soon enough, it was hard to find a power centre that wasn’t offended by the assembly. Nor did it help that the League, having repaired its fortunes, was now asking Fatima Jinnah to take over the party. By nearly all metrics, the fortress group was ending 1954 in the middle of its own personal nightmare.
Fatima Jinnah was asked to lead the Muslim League, just as Ayub Khan was moving to evict it from the assembly. Their rivalry would climax 11 years later, during the presidential election of 1965.
But it woke up soon enough: the governor-general, resting in the north, rushed back. The memoirs of generals Ayub and Musa roughly corroborate each other as to the fortress group’s tailspin over the next few weeks: in one surreal meeting at Ghulam’s residence on 23 October, the governor-general — lying prone on hardboard —
screamed abuse at his guests,
ordered Ayub to take over, and refused to give Bogra another chance.
A happy medium was worked out the next night: Ayub moved his soldiers, Mirza padlocked the assembly, and the new Constitution was stillborn 72 hours before its scheduled passage.
To little pushback, prime minister Bogra caved almost immediately to the coup. East Bengal’s two biggest leaders buckled soon after — the price of Suhrawardy and Fazlul Huq’s acquiescence turned out to be a ministry each. The rest of the press was smacked with censorship.
Foreign journals were instead treated to Iskander Mirza, who told them the electorate was bound to act “foolish”; democracy having “run riot during seven years in Pakistan”.
Tamizuddin, 70 years on
If there was resistance, it came from the speaker — heavily surveilled Tamizuddin Khan —
who left for court in a
burqa
, and whose London barrister,  D. N. Pritt, flew into Karachi
disguised as a surgeon.
Tamizuddin couldn’t afford Pritt’s fees; they had to be covered by philanthropist and insurance magnate Roshan Ali Bhimjee.
This would be in stark contrast to the state’s treasure chest: Ghulam’s lawyer, Sir Ivor Jennings, would be paid seven times the chief justice’s annual compensation. Of course, Jennings’s case was also much tougher: the governor-general, acting as the shadow of an alien queen, had dissolved a sovereign assembly, seized power, and installed a regime of his own.
And while Ghulam had declared that the constitutional machinery had “broken down”, the opposite was true — it had whirred to life. The reason for sacking the assembly wasn’t that it had failed to come up with a Constitution. It was that it had succeeded.
Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad.
So the deep state tried another tack: that parliament had lost its representative character, having chugged on for so many years. Yet this would have been believable had it been shuttered after the ruling party’s thrashing at the polls in East Bengal in 1954. That it was left alive only proved the assembly was meant to finish its task.
Not least, whatever the sins of parliament, nothing in the law allowed for the governor-general to handpick a cabinet of his own — hence ministers Ayub and Mirza named as respondents in Tamizuddin’s petition.
Up against such strongmen, Tamizuddin hoped the court’s writs would act as no less than flowers from heaven. And they did: after several packed hearings, with citizens sitting on prayer mats in front of the domed Sindh Chief Court, the judges found for Tamizuddin by unanimous decision.
Not only was parliament sovereign, “I am unshaken in my belief,” held
Justice M. Bukhsh Memon,
“that the Governor-General had no power of any kind to dissolve the Constituent Assembly.”
The Munir court
Beaten on all fronts, Jennings switched strategies: in an unwinnable case, best to dodge the merits altogether. In its appeal before the Federal Court (now the Supreme Court), the state argued that the Sindh Chief Court never had the power to issue writs, because the law providing for such powers had never been assented to by the governor-general.
Chief Justice Munir.
And the governor-general’s assent was very much required, given Pakistan was still a dominion under the queen. It was a lawyer’s loophole; one that Justice Muhammad Munir had already closed in
Sarfraz v. Crown
in 1950, holding that the legislature was unfettered and, in so many words, that no such assent was required.
We now know Munir was all set to change his mind, and that he was
in constant touch with Ghulam
through coded messages, relayed via secretary.
Less discussed, however, is just how blatantly Ghulam and his lawyers signalled that an adverse verdict would never be honoured. Silky threats were framed in polite legalese: the governor-general felt it undesirable,
his senior lawyer Diplock told Munir
in open court, “to abrogate that other essential feature of the democratic constitution: the rule of force, to prevent the matter coming before the courts”.
Translation:
The governor-general could have used naked coercion to stop you judges from hearing this case — but he hasn’t yet.
“My Lords,” Diplock carried on, “it may be, indeed it would have been his duty, had circumstances so necessitated, to take those steps without regard to the writ which had been issued, because
salus populi suprema lex
: to go as far as that — fortunately — it has not been necessary at present.”
Translation:
The people’s safety comes first (salus populi suprema lex). That means he can ignore your orders, as and when you make that necessary.
And Ghulam’s continued control over the coercive apparatus weighed heavy on the chief justice, as he himself would admit years later.
Hence, in contravention of all law, precedent, and basic sense, the Munir court axed the assembly — Jinnah’s greatest hope. Most incredible of all, it never decided the core question: whether the assembly was dissolved rightly or wrongly.
In his farewell speech,
Justice Munir said
that had he gone another way in
Tamizuddin
, “I am quite sure that there would have been chaos in the country and a revolution would have been formally enacted, possibly by bloodshed.”
Yet such a decision only sped up the ‘revolution’ when it came — in 1958, led by Ayub — which the judge blessed at once. Brute strength is its own excuse.
Even so, it’s hard to overemphasise just how much Munir’s verdict in Tamizuddin altered Pakistan’s destiny. As
scholar Allen McGrath writes,
“One of the most important differences between Ghulam Muhammad’s Pakistan and the nation as it was under Jinnah, Liaquat, and Nazimuddin was that the Constituent Assembly no longer possessed the sovereign power of the state.”
And when Munir denied the existence of the assembly’s sovereignty, he destroyed the country’s existing constitutional basis. In essence, sovereign power in Pakistan would become a prize, to be seized by the strongest.
It still is.
Final frontiers
A smidge over 70 years to the day, the relationship between power and legitimacy remains as tenuous. The Supreme Court, too, finds itself having to face, in full view, the high courts’ ‘demolition’, to quote from the plea moved by five Islamabad judges.
“This petition,” they submit, “is a desperate measure of the last resort.”
And the choice is a stark one: that fidelity to the Constitution either demands hanging up their robes, “or to beseech the Supreme Court to answer some hard truths”.

flood affected
people during their evacuation from their homes to safer places in the Khan Bela of the Jalalpur Pirwala area.
Some videos went viral on social media while private TV channels also aired special transmissions in which the flood victims had protested against overcharging during their evacuation as well as the government officials’ apathy in their relief and rescue work.
Some TV reporters had also accused some boatmen of charging even Rs100,000 to Rs500,000 for shifting the body of a flood victim.
The Multan police swung into action following flood victims’ complaints.
SSP Multan Dr Khadeja Umar took action on the complaints of overcharging by the private boatmen at Khan Bela road and Jalalpur Pirwala arrested Allah Wasya and Majid and seized their boats.
ENCOUNTER:
The CCD team in Multan arrested an injured robbery suspect involved in over 50 criminal cases registered with various police stations after an encounter near Sawanwali Pul.
According to the CCD, when two motorcyclists appeared on the scene, the patrolling CCD team signaled them to stop. Instead of stopping, they allegedly opened fire on the CCD team whose constable Muhammad Sharif also came in firing range but escaped due to his bullet-proof jacket.
The suspect, Salim, suffered injuries with the firing of his accomplice who fled from the scene. The CCD team registered a case against him and launched the hunt for his arrest in the area.
In another case, Shah Shams police in Multan arrested one Adnan, an accomplice of a nominated proclaimed offender and rapist, on the charges of helping him to evade arrest.
According to Shah Shams police, when a team reached to arrest the PO, Adnan warned him and helped him flee from the scene. Police arrested Adnan and registered a case against him.
DROWNS:
A teenage boy drowned in the floodwater in the fields at Adam Wahan on Munshiwala Road, Lodhran.
According to media coordinator Muhammad Safdar of Rescue 1122 Lodhran, Abdul Rehman (14) was walking through the accumulated rainwater when his hand slipped from his mother’s. As a result, he drowned.
The rescuers retrieved his body after three hours’ efforts in the deep floodwater and handed it over to his family.
HEALTH WORKERS:
A division bench of Lahore High Court (LHC) in Multan dismissed the intra-court appeal (ICA) of the district health authority (DHA) Multan and upheld the decision of the single bench on the reinstatement of 700 of its sacked/temporary employees and regularization of their job.
Earlier, the single bench of the LHC had accepted the plea of the workers to regularise them and the health department had challenged it.

A heated exchange between the two took place during the hearing of a plea filed on behalf of rights activist Dr Mahrang Baloch, who has been in custody
since March
. The petitioner had sought the removal of Mahrang’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL), which restricts a person’s travel abroad.
Mazari was representing her in the court, when, at one point, the IHC chief justice remarked, “If I issue any order in this case, then Miss Mazari would go downstairs and hold a programme, [saying] that a dictator is sitting [here].”
At this, Mazari maintained she had said “no such thing that could be considered outside the boundaries of the law”.
“You should also remain within the boundaries of respect,” Justice Dogar then told Mazari.
At that, Mazari clarified that “whatever I have said was in a personal capacity”, adding that “it should not affect the client’s case.”
“If you have any prejudice against me, don’t let the client’s case get affected. I have come here with a brief, not in a personal capacity,” the lawyer added.
At this point, Justice Dogar remarked, “You commented that I am not a judge but sitting here as a ‘dictator’. Should we not initiate contempt of court proceedings against you?”
It is not clear which instance of Mazari calling him a dictator the judge was referring to.
Responding to the judge, Mazari said, “I have not said anything beyond the jurisdiction of the law and Constitution. If you want to initiate contempt of court proceedings, then please do so. The Constitution has given me the right to freedom of expression, which is what I have used.”
Addressing Mazari’s husband, the IHC chief justice then said: “Hadi sahib, make her understand; if I get hold of her someday …”
Mazari then quipped, “If we are at a stage where courts will threaten lawyers, then go ahead with contempt of court [proceedings].”
After the hearing today, Mazari posted on X that “it is important for CJ IHC to understand that I am not activist Imaan Mazari in his court, I am a lawyer holding a brief for my client and conduct myself according to professional etiquette (and a court should do the same).”
She reiterated that Mahrang Baloch’s case “should not suffer because of any grievances a judge may have with her lawyer over the right to freedom of expression in a personal capacity”.
Mazari is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities. In June, she
won
the World Expression Forum’s Young Inspiration Award 2025 on for her efforts and work advocating for the rule of law and justice in the country.
On Monday, an additional district and sessions court in Islamabad
granted interim bail
to Mazari and her husband in a case registered against them on the charges of alleged anti-state activities on social media. In the same case today, the court accepted the pre-arrest bail plea of the couple.
According to the first information report (FIR) of the case, registered by the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency, Mazari and Chatha were accused of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
The FIR alleged that they held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It stated that Mazari and Chatha had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including Balochistan Liberation Army and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
Mazari was also among the voices
calling for a probe
into allegations made by six IHC judges against interference in judicial affairs by the country’s intelligence apparatus in March.

murder
case of 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf on Saturday.
The accused pled not guilty to murdering Yousaf, who was shot dead at her house in June.
During the hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Mohammad Afzal Majoka enquired whether Hayat had killed Sana.
“I did not commit any such crime,” the accused replied.
The judge then asked him whether he was falsely accused in the case.
“Is this all a lie?” the judge remarked. He also pointed out that Hayat had also been accused of snatching Yousaf’s mobile phone.
At that, the accused maintained that all allegations levelled against him were “based on falsehood”.
The court then adjourned the hearing until September 25.
Islamabad police had
arrested
Hayat on June 3, a day after Yousaf was killed at her house in Islamabad.
Preceding his arrest, a first information report (FIR) of the murder was registered at Islamabad’s Sumbal police station against an unidentified man on the complaint of Sana’s mother, Farzana Yousaf, invoking Section 302 (intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
In the FIR, Yousaf’s mother said that a man with a pistol in his hand had entered their house suddenly at around 5pm and “shot straight at my daughter with the intention to kill”.
Later, Islamabad Inspector General (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi had said during a press conference the police had arrested a suspect, who was a was a 22-year-old man, from Faisalabad.
He said Hayat had tried to contact Yousaf repeatedly and was being “rejected by her again and again”, adding that the accused had taken Yousaf’s mobile phone in a bid to wipe out the evidence but it had been recovered along with the weapon of offence.
On July 25, police had formally
submitted
the challan against Hayat to the prosecution branch of the district and sessions courts. It also included Hayat’s confessional statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
In his statement, Hayat — son of a retired government official and a TikToker himself — said he had developed a one-sided infatuation with Sana after connecting with her through social media. He had confessed that suspicion and jealousy drove him to kill her.
Hayat revealed that he had travelled from Jaranwala to Islamabad on May 28 to wish Sana on her birthday. When she did not meet him, he became convinced she was deliberately avoiding him, he said, adding that On June 2, he returned to the capital after renting a Toyota Fortuner and carrying a 30-bore pistol, intending to confront her.
According to his account, when Sana did not respond to his repeated calls, he went to her home in G-13 sector of the capital, forced his way inside, and fatally shot her in front of her mother and maternal aunt. He then took Sana’s mobile phone to erase their conversations and fled.
Hayat said he directed the driver to drive fast and later hid the murder weapon near a railway bridge before returning to Jaranwala.
Following the last hearing of the case on September 13,
Dawn
reported
that Hayat had expressed remorse for his actions, telling the magistrate that he felt deeply ashamed for having taken the life of an innocent teenage girl.

Holding placards, the students assembled in Mera Akazai area and urged the government to immediately construct a building for their school and upgrade it to a regular government primary school.
They said it was the only educational facility in the area, and they could not travel far away to pursue their basic education.
A local elder, Zahid Khan, said they had repeatedly raised the issue with the Elementary Education Foundation but no step had been taken.
“The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government should build a primary school here so local boys and girls can get education at their doorstep,” he said.
He added that though Torghar was given the status of a settled district in 2011, tribesmen were still deprived of basic amenities and services.
“There isn’t a single higher secondary school for girls in the entire district,” Mr Khan said. He demanded that the government develop proper educational infrastructure in Torghar.

“We have laid the foundation stone of this project, which will be a milestone for traffic,” the PM said. “This one-kilometre flyover will give the residents of Islamabad and Rawalpindi relief.”
Lauding the efforts of the interior minister and CDA, who conceived the project, the PM congratulated them on the occasion.
“This will serve the public interest greatly,” he said. “We need to set new benchmarks for work, quality and adherence to timelines. There must be no compromise on quality.”
PM Shehbaz added that the railways and interior ministries are working on a rail project which will connect Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
“I was informed by Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi that there will be another form of transport to serve the public interest in the form of a rail car which connects Islamabad and Rawalpindi,” he stated.
“We already have the metro, and we started a bus service. The CDA introduced EVs,” the PM added. “Once we get the railcar going and set up a track, this project can greatly benefit the citizens of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, as well as commuters from surrounding areas.”

“We have confirmed that both the deceased and her spouse were underage,” SHO Hussain said. “The deceased was 12 years old and her husband was only 10.
“The marriage was illegal and the girl’s death is also suspicious.”
Police launched an inquiry under Section 176 (inquiry by magistrate into cause of death) of the Criminal Code of Procedure to determine the cause of the girl’s death.
Replying to a question, SHO Hussain said that after consultation with the district public prosecutor, a first information report would be lodged against the Nikah registrar and all witnesses present at the Nikah of both children.
The SHO said that both children’s parents would also be arrested and “justice would be ensured”.

found
in Tank district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, taking the total number of cases detected this year to 24, a week-long special anti-polio campaign was launched in 26 of the 36 districts of Balochistan on Monday amid tight security.
The latest polio case involved a 20-month-old girl from Ping union coun­cil of Tank district, an official of NIH confirmed.
“This is the 14th polio case from southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province this year. With this detection, the total number of polio cases found in the country in 2025 reached 24. The break-up of the polio cases is: 16 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, six in Sindh, and one each in Punjab and Gilgit-Balti­stan,” the official said.
He said the victim belo­nged to ​Bettani tribe, adding that the case belonged to highly security compromised area not accessible for vaccination and no travel history was found.
Meanwhile, a week-long special polio campaign was launched in 26 of the 36 districts in Balochistan amid tight security. Provi­ncial authorities have made strict security arran­g­eme­nts to ensure safety of the polio workers in view of the recent target killing of a supervisor of the Polio Pro­g­ramme in Chaman, a town bordering Afghan­istan.
He was targeted by armed men in Roghani area of Chaman while taking part in creating awareness among the parents along with polio workers before launching the campaign in the area.
“We are providing tight security to our polio workers in all the 26 districts where polio staff was administering polio drops and vaccination,” a senior official told
Dawn
, adding that during the week-long campaign more than 2.18 million children under the age of five will be administered anti-polio drops.
The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) Balochistan Coordinator Inam-ul-Haq while announcing the campaign programme said that during the drive in the province more than 2.18 million children under the age of five will be administered anti-polio drops.
Calling the campaign, a crucial step in the fight against poliovirus, Mr Haq urged parents to ensure their children receive the vaccine, warning that failure to do so could result in lifelong disability.
“All preparations have been finalised, and vaccination teams have been fully mobilised in both urban and remote areas of the province,” he said.
The campaign was launched in Quetta, Pishin, Qilla Abdullah, Chaman, Barkhan, Dera Bugti, Hub, Jaffarabad, Jhal Magsi, Kalat, Khuzdar, Qilla Saifullah, Loralai, Mastung, Noshki, Nasirabad, Sherani, Sibi, Sohbatpur, Usta Mohammad, Zhob, Musakhail, Chagai, Duki, Lasbela, and Ziarat.
A total of 11,659 teams will take part in the drive, including 9,129 mobile teams, 958 fixed-site teams, and 586 transit teams deployed at bus terminals, railway stations, and other key locations. Mr Haq stressed that the success of the campaign depends heavily on the community support. He appealed to civil society members, teachers and religious leaders to help raise awareness about polio among the masses and encourage families to get their children vaccinated.
Alongside the polio campaign, he also reminded parents of the importance of routine immunisation, which protects children against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and diphtheria.
He urged families to visit their nearest health centers to ensure their children receive all scheduled vaccines on time.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941366/climate-emergency,Climate emergency - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE federal cabinet’s
decision
to declare a climate and agriculture emergency in the country was overdue given the magnitude of devastation resulting from the
floods
sweeping across Punjab and beyond.
The images of inundated fields in thousands of villages, displaced families, destroyed homes and dead livestock underscore the seriousness of the catastrophe. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has set up a special committee to assess the extent of damage to agriculture, determine how farmers can be compensated and recommend steps to mitigate the deluge’s impact on the economy.
The devastation will test both the state’s resolve and ability to rehabilitate displaced communities, protect food security and rebuild rural livelihoods in the face of recurring climate shocks. Immediate relief must come first: announcement of financial compensation for smallholders for their losses and soft loans to buy inputs for the next crop cycle; provision of food and fodder supplies; and veterinary and healthcare services in the flood-affected areas to prevent the outbreak of disease.
Equally critical will be the protection of consumers from a possible surge in inflation, which may require timely food imports and stringent action against hoarders.
That said, the massive nationwide human and economic losses and destruction of infrastructure caused by floods past and present show that even prompt and generous relief and rehabilitation efforts remain insufficient.
The government, therefore, should combine relief and rehabilitation with long-term sustained investments in climate adaptation and mitigation so that the economy and farmers are not left at the mercy of extreme weather events, be they floods, droughts or heatwaves.
While declaring a climate and agriculture emergency, the PM has rightly stressed the need for a comprehensive strategy to tackle climate challenges.
In this respect, a broader framework for action — the 31-point Declaration on Rights of Nature & Climate Justice — has already evolved under the Dawn Media Group’s Breathe Pakistan initiative.
Drawing from climate rights guaranteed under Article 9A of the Constitution, the call is for all stakeholders to build a “climate democracy”. The initiative provides a plan on how to build climate resilience around the restoration of the ecological balance to protect the vulnerable, and secure justice and sustainability for future generations.
Indeed, the national challenge is enormous and demands wide-ranging constitutional, legal and social reforms, besides close cooperation between the centre and provinces.
It also requires other stakeholders — businesses, high-net-worth individuals and civil society — to step up and help the government build climate resilience. After all, climate change is no longer a challenge for governments alone; nor does it impact just the rural economy. It also imposes significant costs on businesses in multiple ways as Pakistan’s vulnerability to destructive climate-induced events increases by the day.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944673/undergraduate-education-quality,Undergraduate education quality - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"WE already have 270-odd universities in the country. And many new ones are being set up every year.
The government has also elevated many colleges to university status. But if we were to earnestly inquire about how many universities are offering quality undergraduate education in both the public and private sectors, we would not be able to name more than a handful of universities.
All of them together do not offer more than approximately 20,000 admissions every year. The bulk of students enrolling in undergraduate programmes end up at institutions that offer lower-quality education.
It was, thus, not a surprise to see many universities struggling to fill admission slots this year. Top schools, again across the public-private spectrum, did not have this issue. They had a record number of applicants in most departments. But places with a poorer quality of education, or education that does not guarantee adequate returns to students, struggled. These struggles are only going to increase as we move forward.
The importance of quality undergraduate education cannot be overemphasised. Students start maturing at around 18-22 years. They start understanding themselves and the world a lot better. Their personalities start evolving. They fully enter public life. This is the age where individuals and citizens are created, shaped, and refined as they learn more about the world as well as themselves.
In countries like the US, almost 50 per cent of young people around 18 enter college programmes; in Pakistan, only 7-8pc of the relevant cohort reach that level. The difference is stark. My conjecture is that we will not be able to address human capital issues in Pakistan, which are keeping our growth limited, unless we are able to educate a lot more of our children, and are able to focus on providing better quality undergraduate education to a lot more of these young people.
What does quality education at the undergraduate level entail?
Undergraduate education is mostly about learning how to learn. If we do that well, the student is set for life. Students completing undergraduate studies should definitely have some knowledge and skills pertaining to their area of study (their major). But what is more important is that they should have good communication and language skills and the ability to think deeply and critically about issues; they should have argumentation skills and the ability to present themselves well; they should know how they learn and be able to engage deeply with the subjects they are curious about. If they have and do the above, they will definitely have the confidence needed to step into new things. This confidence, based on deep knowledge and skills, is a crucial outcome of a good undergraduate education.
The economic and social background of some of our young people, as well as family support, can facilitate them in acquiring some of the skills and knowledge they need, and shape their attitudes. But for many, this is not the case, and their college or university has to step up to take care of this. Sadly, most universities in Pakistan are failing in this task quite drastically.
Universities do not have language and writing centres, and lack mentoring and co-curricular programmes that could strengthen the focus on developing the needed skills. Too many of our university managers/ administrators, and too many of our university faculty, feel that imparting subject-specific knowledge is what undergraduate education is about, and that this is what they have been hired for.
Confidence based on knowledge and skills is a crucial outcome of a good undergraduate education.
Being an economics major at the undergraduate level is not just about understanding the basics of economics and being aware of where the field stands currently. It is a lot more. One should be aware not only of the foundations of economics and its historical development, but also of the context in which the subject is being taught. It requires some knowledge of other social sciences, the sciences, and the humanities.
One should know how the subject relates to challenges that people deal with in their daily lives and be able to apply the theoretical framework of the subject to not only understand but also to look for ways of addressing them. The subject and ways of thinking should be internalised to the point they become a part of who one is. And one should be able to communicate all of this to others as well. This is what a graduate coming out of a decent-quality undergraduate programme should be able to do.
How many of our universities and undergraduate programmes are able to claim that they are in a position to achieve all this for their students? Or that the students are progressing in this direction?
I have been teaching for some 30 years now. During this period, I have interacted with and taught thousands of students, written hundreds of letters of recommendation, and interviewed thousands of candidates for recruitment as research/ teaching assistants, faculty, administrators, and many other positions. I have found that the quality of an undergraduate education, though not exclusively, is a very good predictor of the suitability of a candidate for the post. Of course, there are always exceptions — unimpressive people who have studied in good undergraduate programmes and impressive people who did not get the opportunity. But, in general, the correlation has been a strong one. And, as explained here, there is a good reason for that.
In Pakistan, we have neglected, especially since the birth of the Higher Education Com­mission, undergraduate education and teaching, and focused too much on graduate education and research. This is not what Pakistan needs. My plea to existing as well as upcoming universities is to focus on the quality of undergraduate teaching and learning. This will help us address many of the quality issues we are witnessing in our education system.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945309/number-of-polio-vaccine-refusal-cases-drops-in-kp,Number of polio vaccine refusal cases drops in KP - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"PESHAWAR: The number of children remaining unvaccinated due to parental refusal has come down in the recent
immunisation drive
compared to the previous campaign, data shows.
The five-day vaccination effort in May conducted by Emergency Operation Centre, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, recorded 17,136 children without getting oral polio vaccine (OPV), mostly due to parents’ reluctance due to misconception that the drops were not allowed in Islam or on the pretext that those were designed by western countries to render the recipients infertile and impotent and reduce the population of Muslims.
The first argument has been vehemently rejected by edicts issued by Islamic scholars from reputed universities and religious schools. The second plea advanced for non-vaccination has been rejected by laboratory scientists, saying these drops are safe and have played instrumental role in eradicating the crippling ailment worldwide.
However, the recently-concluded vaccination drive last week, shows that the number of refusals against polio drops has dwindled to 14,712, which the authorities attribute to the hard work of frontline vaccinators with strong backing of district administrations and district health officers.
Only 17,136 children remained unvaccinated in previous campaign
In May, the tally of children staying unvaccinated due to their non-availability during door-to-door visits by health workers was 64,328, which rose by less than 1,000.
Peshawar as usual remained atop of list of refusal cases by recording 5,977 unvaccinated children in September down from 6,812 recorded in May while Lakki Marwat occupied second spot with 2,128 refusal cases compared to 2,382 recorded by the district in September.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has detected 18 polio cases, the highest number recorded by any province in Pakistan this year so far. The total number of polio cases registered in the country in the ongoing year in 27.
The disease has crippled seven children in Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, four cases have been recorded in Lakki Marwat, Tank and North Waziristan each, three in Bannu, and one each in Torghar, Kohistan Lower and Dera Ismail Khan.
The disease is mostly prevalent in violence-stricken southern districts of the province where the number of refusals and non-available children is more than the rest of the province.
Except Peshawar, the situation in central districts and Malakand is not worrisome as the vaccinators do not have problems in reaching the target population but the southern belt is fraught with issues that have been hampering the smooth-sailing of the drive, making the dream of polio-eradication more difficult.
Officials at EOC say that Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, in his capacity as chairman of Task Force on Polio, is aware of the issues in southern districts and has been holding meetings with district administrations and issuing instructions to them before every drive to ensure that all children below five years receive anti-polio drops in every effort.
The last drive was conducted peacefully as no case of violence was reported but the problem of unvaccinated children remained the major task, they said.
“Our workers are reaching more than 99 per cent target children but less than one per cent children stay unvaccinated due to refusals or non-availability during the campaign. For getting polio eradication certificate, we need to ensure that all children are inoculated in every campaign for three consecutive years,” said officials.
They said that in every campaign, they missed very few children due to which eradication of the crippling disease was not possible.
There are known people, who are opposed to vaccination and they have been denying polio vaccination for years on flimsy grounds.
This vicious cycle continues to thwart the eradication efforts as well as loss of lives of policemen and health workers, who are killed by unidentified armed men during anti-polio campaigns in the province.

One suspect is currently in custody, while another of his alleged accomplices have been identified and efforts are underway to arrest him, DIG South Syed Asad Raza told
Dawn
.
The suspect, a fruit vendor, was apprehended by Defence police from Qayyumabad with the help of locals, the officer said.
Investigations are underway, and police are said to have obtained video evidence of multiple incidents of sexual assault against minor boys and girls. Although it is too early to say just how many victims the suspects have assaulted, investigators think they could number over a hundred.
“Police have recovered a mobile phone from his custody containing hundreds of videos filmed in his room that show graphic scenes involving children,” DIG Raza said, adding that he was being interrogated further.
DIG South says efforts underway to track down his accomplices; scores of videos unearthed from phone, USB drive suggest suspect had been preying on children for years
According to police, the suspect came to Qayyumabad in 2016 and started luring and trapping children around 2019. He first opened a grocery shop, and then a juice cart.
When asked how he managed to keep his activities clandestine for such a long period of time, DIG Raza also expressed surprise, saying that the matter came to the authorities’ attention after one of his alleged victims managed to obtain a USB drive from the suspect.
The victim then took the USB to a video shop for the purpose of downloading music onto it, but the shop owner detected the presence of explicit content on the drive and informed area residents, who apprehended the suspect and beat him up before handing him over to the police.
“A USB and the mobile phone are in police custody which contain many such videos,” said the DIG.
Police then approached the parents of the victims, who came to the police station and lodged three FIRs against the suspect. A special team — led by DSP Defence Dr Saifullah — has been set up to investigate the case. The committee also includes the Defence SHO, SIO Defence, and the SIO Women Police Station.
“The team shall make hectic efforts into the cases by utilising all available resources and shall submit reports on a daily basis,” according to a police order.
The FIRs, registered on the complaint of the father of a couple of victims, states that the two girls, aged 10 and 12, had been upset for some days and complained about pain in their body. When quizzed by their mother, they revealed that the suspect had sexually assaulted them.
Another complainant, a labourer, has filed a case on behalf of his 10-year-old sister, who also complained of pain after the suspect took her to his residence on Sept 4, and assaulted her. The act was also filmed, according to the FIR.
A third complainant said that his seven-year old daughter had been silent for one week and also complained of pain.

However, he said that they had stance over ending this war, which was through dialogue. Besides, he said that whenever civilians were

, the provincial government had always condemned it.
He said that the civilian losses in the fight against terrorism were not acceptable at all costs and his government had always voiced its opposition.
He said that the KP government was of the view that the issue could be resolved through dialogue. He said that time had proven that military operations were not a solution; rather, terrorism had further increased after such actions. He said that the KP government was criticised for proposing talks with Afghanistan government to end terrorism in the region.
Mr Gandapur, however, said that informal contacts with Afghanistan government in that regard were positive. He said that they would share the names of tribal elders who would take part in talks with the Afghan administration with the federal government this week.

petitions
separately filed by five sitting judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) before the apex court.
Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Raffat Imtiaz had appeared in person before the Supreme Court last Friday to institute constitutional petitions challenging the exercise of administrative powers by the IHC chief justice.
According to the objections, the petitioners invoked the apex court’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but the grievances raised were of an individual nature and thus not maintainable in view of the 1998 Zulfiqar Mehdi case.
In that judgement, the SC had held that Article 184(3) could not be pressed into service for redress of personal grievances.
Incidentally, the same case law was cited by the SC registrar while returning Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar’s petition, seeking a hearing of challenges to the 26th Amendment, on the same day. The registrar office further observed that the petitioners had not demonstrated what questions of “public importance” were involved for the enforcement of fundamental rights — a condition precedent for invoking Article 184(3), sources said.
It added that the notices issued to the respondents — IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, the registrar of the high court, and the federal government through the law secretary — had not been properly drawn up, since they failed to specify the purpose of the petitions.
In their petitions, the judges sought a declaration that the administrative powers of the IHC chief justice could not be exercised in a manner that undermined judicial authority. They argued that once a bench was seized of a matter, the IHC CJ was not empowered to transfer cases or reconstitute the bench, nor to exclude available judges from the roster at will.
The pleas further contended that constitution of benches, transfer of cases and issuance of rosters could only be undertaken in terms of Articles 192(1) and 202 of the Constitution, and that the “Master of the Roster” doctrine had already been set aside by the SC in its 2024 judgement in the Practice and Procedure case.
They also challenged the formation of the IHC administrative committees through notifications issued on Feb 3 and July 15 this year, terming them mala fide, illegal and coram non judice, and requested the apex court to declare such notifications void.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted the operation in the Daraban area, upon the reported presence of terrorists “belonging to Indian proxy,
Fitna al Khwarij
”.
The state uses the term
Fitna al Khwarij
to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as
Fitna al Hindustan
to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, [our] own troops effectively engaged the
khwarij
location and [as a result], 13 Indian sponsored
khwarij
were sent to hell,” the statement read.
The ISPR added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activity in the area.
The statement added that these terrorists were involved in “facilitation [of] a suicide bombing attack in Daraban in December 2023, [the] abduction and target killing of government officials and innocent civilians”.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored
kharji
found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
On September 21, security personnel
launched
an IBO in the same district, where they killed seven terrorists, including three “Afghan nationals”. In a statement, the ISPR said that the operation was carried out in the Kulachi area upon the presence of “

location and [as a result], seven Indian sponsored khwarij, including three Afghan National khwarij and two suicide bombers, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.
The statement added that Pakistan expects the interim Afghan government, run by the Afghan Taliban, to uphold its responsibilities and deny the use of its soil to carry out acts of terror.

flood
damage and rehabilitation needs in the Malakand Division has reduced the estimated costs from Rs12.2 billion to Rs5.79 billion.
Officials told
Dawn
that the local government department carried out the “re-verification” of damage, which was reported by authorities at the village and neighbourhood council level, the only grassroots government in the province.
A senior official said a “three-tier mechanism” was used to check the damage assessment reports received from the district administration.
The documents show that after the Aug 15 rains, which caused over 400 causalities and widespread infrastructure damage across Malakand Division, the provincial government tasked local government secretary Saqib Raza Aslam with “coordinating collection of the data of the damage assessed by the communication and works, public health engineering, local government and irrigation departments, and prepare rehabilitation plans.
They noted that the damage assessment exercise began from the offices of the Water and Sanitation Services Company Swat following a visit to the flood-affected areas and it was decided to limit the assessment to damage incurred after the early hours of Aug 15 and it would be geo-tagged.
The documents also revealed that it was decided that the restoration would mean rehabilitating infrastructure to what it was on Aug 14, while the complete rehabilitation would be reported and calculated separately. Also, the LG teams will assess damages and calculate rehabilitation independently as a third party verification.
The damage assessment reports submitted by the relevant departments were scrutinised thrice between August 19 and 25.
The assessment carried by the line departments put the cost of rehabilitation of 538 damaged development schemes at over Rs12.2 billion with the communication and works department claiming the major chunk of losses worth over Rs7 billion. The irrigation department came up with the figure of Rs4.7 billion and the public health engineering department with Rs442 million.
The documents noted that LG department through its field formations “re-verified” the estimated costs of rehabilitation.
They showed that teams were constituted comprising the secretary of the village and neighborhood council, sub-engineer, patwari halqa, assistant engineer, assistant director and senior official of district administration. Also, elected representatives and secretaries of every village and neighbourhood council also independently reported whether or not their area was affected.
The documents revealed that the teams later visited every affected project site and took feedback from the community as well, while the damage was assessed on a predefined proforma.Teams of the director general (monitoring and evaluation) at the planning and development department were asked to help “cross-verify” LG teams’ working.
The documents said that the re-verification showed that the schemes damaged before Aug 15 were also included for rehabilitation. In addition, on several occasions, geo-tags were found missing and the schemes slated as damaged were duplicated.
The LG department’s exercise showed that out of 1,053 village and neighbourhood councils in eight districts of Malakand division, just 273 were affected by the Aug 15 rains and floods.
The final damage assessment report revealed that a total of 923 development schemes were damaged in 273 village and neighbourhood councils of the Malakand Division, including 238 roads, 109 bridges, 87 drinking water supply schemes, 91 irrigation channels, 212 retaining walls, 154 sanitation schemes and 32 public buildings. The exercise put the cost of the rehabilitation of the damaged facilities at Rs5.7 billion compared instead of the initial Rs12.2 billion, according to documents.

Addit­ional District and Sessions Judge Nasruminallah Bal­och has ordered the initiation of proclamation proceedings against Bahria Town founder Malik Riaz and his son Ali Riaz Malik in two cases pertaining to alleged money laundering of the housing giant’s funds abroad.
During Saturday’s hearing, the court adjourned further proceedings aga­inst the real estate tycoon and his son until September 30, while moving to formally declare them as absconder in the cases.
Last week, the same court distributed copies of the challan among three other accused, including retired Colonel Khalilur Rehman, personal staff officer of Malik Riaz, along with Mushtaq and Imran.
According to court proceedings, Mr Rehman received the challan in person. Mushtaq appeared physically, while Imran’s attendance was marked via video link. Both Mushtaq and Imran are expected to appear in person at the next hearing.
The FIA’s money laundering wing registered the case, alleging that the accused illegally transferred large sums abroad to finance Malik Riaz’s Dubai property project.
The court’s move comes at a time when Mr Riaz is facing mounting legal
troubles.
Last month, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar revealed that investigators had found “incontrovertible proof of large-scale money laundering and corruption by Mr Riaz and his company.
He disclosed that the FIA raided Safari Hospital in Rawalpindi, which was allegedly used as a “front office” to conceal cash and records.
According to the minister, hospital ambulances were used to transport money and documents to avoid raising suspicion.
The raid unearthed evidence of Rs1.12 billion in money laundering, while investigators expect further amounts to surface as the probe deepens. Mr Tarar also
alleged
that Bahria Town’s chief financial officer and finance director were linked to hawala and hundi operators engaged in sending funds abroad. He added that Bahria Town staff attempted to destroy documents during the raid, but investigators managed to seize most of the records.
The minister clarified that the government’s inquiry was focused on Mr Riaz, his family, and company officials, and not on residents of Bahria Town.

The incident came to light after a video went viral on social media, showing a teacher beating a minor boy with a stick, while two other children were holding his arms and legs.
The abuse allegedly occurred in Ahmed Welfare Foundation, an unregistered private orphanage.
Sahiwal District Police Officer (DPO) Rana Tahir took notice of the video and directed the Chichawatni city police to intervene.
17 of them belong to Balochistan
A police team, led by Sub-Inspector Muhammad Jaffar, raided the facility and confirmed the torture. They found that a teacher, Ahmed Bashir, had allegedly tortured a 10-year-old orphan boy, Shahzad.
The police arrested Bashir, who confessed to be a caretaker at the foundation.
A First Information Report (FIR) was filed under section 323-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The police say that most of the children in the orphanage were being subjected to physical abuse on a daily basis.
Meanwhile, CPB District Officer Muhammad Adnan, who came to know about the issue through social media, directed the bureau’s Legal Officer Ali Akbar to approach the court for a search order.
Accordingly, Mr Akbar approached Additional Sessions Judge Muhammad Farrukh Hameed, seeking a search order for the foundation.
After getting the search order from the court, a CPB team raided the foundation’s premises and rescued 18 children detained there, all under the age of 10.
CPB officials say that 17 of the recovered children are from different districts of Balochistan, and one from Chichawatni.
The CPB investigations revealed that the foundation is not a registered body and its owners are from Islamabad.
Police say that the foundation owners, caretakers and management fled the premises before the raid.
DPO Tahir stated that police are investigating the matter.
Mr Adnan told
Dawn
that the recovered children have been lodged in the CPB’s district office, where they are being provided food and clothes, adding that all of them would be presented in the court on Wednesday (today).

In Pakistan alone, an estimated 1,000 people, mostly children, die every year from rabies, despite the availability of life-saving treatment.
World Rabies Day is being observed today (Sept 28), and this year’s theme, “Act Now: You, Me, Community,” underscores the urgent need for awareness and action.
“Rabies does not have to claim lives, it is 100pc preventable if the right steps are taken immediately,” said Dr. Mohammad Irfan Habib, Medical Director, ChildLife Foundation.
“The tragedy is particularly acute in Pakistan’s rural and low-income communities, where children are frequently bitten by stray dogs while playing or walking to school. Delayed or inaccessible post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) often leads to preventable deaths,” he said.
According to a statement, ChildLife Foundation is leading the fight against rabies through its network of 14 emergency rooms and 300 telemedicine satellite centers across Pakistan under public-private partnership with the government, ensuring 24/7 access to rabies vaccines and immunoglobulin. In 2025 alone, it treated over 11,000 children suffering from dog-bite injuries.
“Every parent and caregiver must know the lifesaving steps: wash dog-bite wounds with soap and water for at least 15 minutes, seek emergency care without delay, and complete the vaccination schedule,” added Dr. Habib.
Globally, countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and the Philippines have drastically reduced rabies deaths through coordinated community and healthcare action. Foundation believes Pakistan can do the same if families, communities, and institutions act together.
It has urged the public to support its Rabies Prevention Drive so that no child in Pakistan dies from a preventable disease.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939274/minister-says-differing-figures-of-floodwater-volumes-confusing-sindh-govt,Minister says differing figures of floodwater volumes confusing Sindh govt - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LARKANA/SUKKUR: Sindh Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro has said that his department is receiving accurate figures from Punjab and “I don’t doubt them”.
Talking to journalists at the broken T-spur at ‘sensitive’ dyke, Moria Loop Bund, near Naudero on Tuesday, he said: “It is possible that the gauges there [in Punjab] had not been properly maintained or they had fallen into floodwater. That is why we are somewhat confused about how much water will eventually arrive at Panjnad.”
The minister guessed that the actual volume of
floodwater
will become clear within the next two/three days. At that time, the Indus River would already be carrying between 200,000 and 250,000 cusecs. “We are preparing for a high flood, and our preparations are based on that,” he added.
He noted that ministers had been assigned duties on both, left and right, banks of the Indus. He pointed out that he himself was continuously camping at Guddu and Sukkur Barrages to monitor the situation.
Strengthening of dykes done, monitoring is continuing but river’s changing pattern always creates trouble: Shoro
He appeared sure that the dykes across Sindh would sustain the pressure of the incoming flood. He repeated his statement that the volume of floodwater entering Sindh could only be assessed once the peak flood reached Panjnand.
He said that after the previous flood, major rehabilitation work at dykes in the province had been undertaken and his department had been keeping a close watch on the behaviour of the Indus River.
“Its ever-changing course pattern had sometimes shifted flow to the right bank and sometimes mounts pressure on left bank.
“Last time, floodwater came into the Chenab and Jhelum rivers in 2014. This time, water has entered the Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers. On Aug 26, at 2pm, the water level in Chenab was at 200,000 cusecs. Thirteen hours later, at night, it rose sharply to between 900,000 and one million cusecs, he pointed out. When the deluge reached Khanki later, it increased further, and at Qadirabad it rose to 1,070,000 cusecs. From there, about 70,000 cusecs of water went toward Trimmu, where the flow rose to 550,000 cusecs by night. From 2am until the following morning, the water began receding,” he said.
This same deluge, passing through the Head Mohammad Wala Bridge in Multan, will eventually reach Panjnad. Currently, at Panjnad, there is an increase of around 150,000 cusecs, according to the minister. He noted that floodwater from Ravi was also flowing toward Panjnad. The floodwaters from Ravi was joining Chenab, downstream Trimmu, and both flows would meet at Panjnad, where the Sutlej water is already present. Then, the combined flow of these five rivers will travel some 60 kilometres downstream to Kot Mithan or Chachran, and within two days it will reach Sindh.
Jam Khan Shoro said that at Ganda Singh, according to the last strong flows reading, there was a volume of 327,000 cusecs. Below that, at Sulemanki, heavy flows were also recorded. “But the data from Ganda Singh and Sulemanki do not match with the figures at Islam. I found out that the gauge at Ganda Singh had collapsed.
“We are very close to Panjnad, and in the next two days, it will become clear whether it will be a very high flood or a super flood,” he said.
The minister said: “The Indus River exerts pressure on sensitive points, such as Akil and Abad dykes on the right bank, and Bakhari, Korija Ja Bhan, Mad, Bhanuoth and Hajipur dykes on the left. We are reinforcing these with spurs. At present, hydrologists have instructed us to build a spur at the Moria Loop Bund, and work has begun … as the river leaves one side, it attacks the other, creating new sites. Sometimes the river shifts right, sometimes left and we respond accordingly.”
The minister also chairing a meeting with officials and engineers of Sukkur Barrage at the installation which was also attended by Irrigation Secretary Zarif Iqbal Khero and Sindh Barrage Improvement Project Director Pritam Das and Development-I Project Director Mansoor Memon, besides Chinese engineers and chief engineers of Guddu and Sukkur barrages.
The Chinese engineers and irrigation officials gave a detailed briefing on the ongoing development work at the Sukkur Barrage during the meeting, which primarily discussed the potential threat of very high flood reaching the barrages.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945290/pmdc-uncovers-rs200m-financial-blunder-in-postgraduate-programmes,PMDC uncovers Rs200m financial blunder in postgraduate programmes - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: After realising a financial blunder amounting to Rs200 million, the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) has begun deliberations on how to recover the amount from institutions that started postgraduate programmes in the last two years.
According to an official of the council, the matter will be referred to the Postgraduate Medical Education Committee (PMEC) to look into it.
As per documents, available with
Dawn
, the issue was highlighted in August 2025 when a university located in Karachi requested to register/recognise 20 postgraduate programmes. Deputy Registrar Dr Habibullah pointed out that the university did not submit the onetime Comprehensive Inspection Fee (CIF) of Rs800,000 for each programme.
Dr Habibullah wrote a letter, available with
Dawn
, to the university to pay the fee. However, after an interaction with the university it was revealed that the PMDC earlier had not charged any such fee for the registration of courses.
Entire amount will be recovered and deposited in council’s account, says official
A senior official of the council, requesting anonymity, said upon the reply of the university, it was decided to check the documents.
“We were shocked to see that during the last two years almost 20 universities had applied and got their postgraduate courses recognised, but not a single one paid CIF - Rs800,000 for each of the programmes,” he added.
“So, Dr Habibullah wrote a letter to the registrar PMDC Dr Wali Khan seeking a clarification. Dr Wali stated in writing [available with Dawn] that the amount had to be received as it was mentioned in the rules,” he said.
It is worth mentioning that PMDC not only regulates medical and dental colleges but also accredits postgraduate programmes under the PMDC Act.
As per PMDC Post Graduate Regulations 2023, every university has to pay Rs300,000 as secretariat charges (per course), Rs 800,000 as CIF (per course), Rs100,000 as application fee (per course) and Rs150,000 as inspector charges (per course).
“However, after analysing the documents of last two years it was revealed that although other charges were received by PMDC, CIF was not charged from any university. The accumulative amount has surpassed Rs200 million,” he claimed.
“Over the years, PMDC has accredited numerous postgraduate institutes, producing thousands of graduates who are considered the cream of the nation’s medical community. For these accreditations, a notified inspection fee is legally required from each institution, covering secretarial and administrative charges for dispatching inspection teams.
However, it has now surfaced that around 20 postgraduate institutes were accredited without ever paying the mandatory Comprehensive Inspection Fee,” he said.
“It is strange that the amount was not charged during the tenure of as many as three different registrars. We demand that the federal government take immediate and drastic steps, not only to recover this colossal loss but also to hold those responsible accountable,” he demanded.
When contacted, a senior official of the PMDC, who requested anonymity, said the matter appeared to have been overlooked but would be addressed soon.
“We are considering referring the issue to PMEC for further investigation. I can assure you that not a single rupee will remain with any university, and the entire amount will be recovered and deposited into the Council’s account,” he said.

The court issued the directive during the hearing of a petition highlighting non-implementation of the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2012.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas asked Peira to file a comprehensive report by October 8 under Section 10 of the Act, explaining how many poor students have been admitted by private schools since the law came into effect. The court also directed the authority to obtain reports from all schools functioning in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and submit them at the next hearing.
The petitioner’s counsel argued that although the Act was enacted in 2012, it was only enforced in 2015, yet despite the passage of a considerable period, compliance remains negligible.
He submitted that under the law, all private schools in ICT are required to allocate at least 10 percent of the seats in each class for disadvantaged children and provide them free education, but this provision has not been implemented in practice.
The counsel contended that Peira, as the designated regulator, had failed to discharge its duty of ensuring compliance with the law.
“It is the sole obligation of the respondent to make certain that every private institution fulfils its legal responsibility,” he said.
The court took note of the arguments and observed that the matter pertained to a fundamental right of access to education for children belonging to poor families. The judge remarked that the issue had persisted for years despite clear provisions of the law, and it was the responsibility of the regulator to enforce it effectively.
The court’s order emphasised that Peira must provide verifiable data on the admission of disadvantaged students since the inception of the Act.
It also called upon the authority to explain what steps it had taken so far to ensure implementation of the 10 per cent quota and whether any monitoring mechanisms or enforcement actions had been initiated against schools that failed to comply.
Education activists have long criticised the lack of enforcement of the 2012 Act, pointing out that while the law provides for compulsory education for all children between the ages of five and sixteen, its provisions have largely remained on paper.
Section 10 specifically places a binding obligation on private schools to accommodate underprivileged children without charging fees, in return for the benefits and recognition they receive from the state.
Despite repeated assurances from the government in the past, ground realities indicate that thousands of deserving children in the federal capital are still deprived of access to private schooling due to financial barriers.
The case has now been adjourned, with Peira expected to submit its comprehensive report on or before October 8.

• Floodwaters not receding as ‘backwater effect’ prevents Chenab from flowing into Indus; high-level alert for Sutlej after advisory from India
• PM Shehbaz forms committee to assess flood damage; official says over 4m people affected by floods
LAHORE: The southern districts of Punjab, particularly Multan, are at risk of
severe flooding
due to the swollen Chenab River, with the authorities preparing for a breach at the Sher Shah dyke to save the urban centres from inundation.
Although no decision had been taken to breach the Shershah bund at the time of going to press, officials were clear that the dyke would have to be breached if the water level crossed the critical threshold of 393.5 feet. As of Monday night, the water level was steady at 393 feet.
Officials said the flood would approach Multan in the next 48 hours, which would make the situation very critical for the city, which is already at risk of flooding.
Against this backdrop, it seemed that the decision to breach the embankment had already been made anticipating a massive surge heading towards Multan from Trimmu Headworks.
Multan MNA and ex-PM Yousaf Raza Gilani, in a Facebook post, asked people living in settlements along the embankment to relocate immediately. The PPP leader said water would be diverted towards Sher Shah, Gagra Kachhor, Mouza Hamar and other adjacent areas to break the flood force and avoid further damage.
Meanwhile, floodwaters that had entered Jalalpur Pirwala on Sunday submerged more localities in the district, including Alipur tehsil. Due to a backwater effect that was preventing the Chenab from falling into the Indus, the water had started flowing upstream of Panjnad.
The water first entered Panjnad Headworks’ downstream settlements Makhan Bela, Azmatpur, Bait Mullanwali, Bait Nabi Shah, Paka Naich, Bazwala, Lati Marri, Bait Burraha, Kundrala, and Bait Channa, and later flooded upstream areas of Ghalwan-I and Dammar Wala Janobi. The authorities relocated thousands of people to save them from flooding.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif constituted a committee led by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal for the completion of the damage and need assessment report of the ongoing floods within two weeks.
Flood threat
Addressing a press conference in Multan, Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Jalalpur Pirwala was still facing the flood threat. He said that the first flood was moving out slowly and the water was not receding, while another surge from Head Trimmu was on its way towards Multan.
He said that the pressure would increase on Head Muhammadwala and the Sher Shah dyke in the next 24 hours. He said 63 people lost their lives and rescue boats had made 27,000 trips in Multan, adding that 4300 villages in 26 districts were affected due to the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab floods.
Multan Commissioner Aamir Kareem Khan said 4,000 people were evacuated and shifted to safer places in Jalalpur Pirwala.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said 4.199 million people from 4,300 villages were affected due to the flooding in the eastern rivers. He said that 2.147 million people, who were trapped in the floods, had been relocated to safer locations and 412 relief and 492 medical camps were established in the flood-affected districts.
The commissioner further shared the water situation of different dams, including Mangla Dam was 88 per cent full while Tarbela Dam was 100pc full. According to the commissioner, India’s Bhakra Dam on the River Sutlej was 90pc full, Pong Dam was 99pc full, while Thein Dam was 97pc full.
Earlier, the PDMA released a high-level flood alert for the Sutlej River, following an official advisory from the Indian High Commission regarding the rising water flow.
According to the alert, the river was experiencing a high flood level at the Harike and Ferozepur downstream points in India, indicating that water levels were expected to rise further within Pakistan.
Ganda Singh Wala Headworks on the Sutlej would continue to be in an “exceptionally high” flood. Besides riverine floods, Punjab’s urban centres also faced urban flooding.
Lahore recorded a heavy rainfall in several of its areas, with some localities, including Jail Road, receiving more than 100mm of rain on Monday. Meanwhile, torrential downpour in Faisalabad broke a 30-year record for the city.
Flowing backwards
As of Monday night, the floodwaters were not receding as the Indus River was pushing back the water from the Sutlej, Chenab, and Ravi rivers. Due to this backwater effect, the operational capacity of the Panjnad Headworks had also reduced, according to a PDMA official.
Despite a steady flow of over 524,000 cusecs at Panjnad, the water was flowing upstream. Panjnad had recorded a flow of 609,664 cusecs till 12:30am and the water receded to 524,762 cusecs by 3:30 pm.
Just like the Indus, the Chenab is pushing back Ravi waters, a phenomenon that has previously led to a perilous rise in pressure at the Sidhnai Barrage on the Ravi River.
For the past few days, flows had remained dangerously steady at over 135,000 cusecs despite falling inflows from the upstream Balloki. To avert a catastrophic breach at Sidhnai, the government had to make a breach at the Mai Sufara embankment to save the barrage.
In a second major emergency operation, a controlled breach was made on the Sutlej River near Jalalpur Pirwala on Sunday night to divert water towards the Vehari district.
RYK capsize
Three people were killed while at least 8-10 people, mostly children, were missing after a boat capsized in the Chenab floodwater in the Noorwala area of tehsil Liaqatpur.
Reports said that a boat carrying almost 28 people capsized in Mouza Noorwala located in the riverbed area of the Chenab.

more amendments
to the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 focused on the protection of judges and prosecution in a bid to “provide a flexible and secure legal framework for the state to respond to evolving security challenges”.
The Anti-Terrorism Balochistan (Amendment) Bill 2025 was tabled by Parliamentary Secretary Mir Zareen Khan Magsi on behalf of the provincial home department, whose minister in-charge is Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti.
The bill said it aimed to strengthen the counter-terrorism framework in accordance with international standards. “In light of the evolving security challenges and the sensitive nature of terrorism related cases, the bill see­ks to empower the government to implement add­i­tional protective measures for the safety and security of judges, public prosecutors, defence counsels, witnesses, and other individuals involved in such proceedings,” it said.
The bill introduces a procedure for handling “sensitive terrorism-related cases through a confidentially appointed BS-21 officer”. This officer, who will remain anonymous, would determine whether a case required extraordinary protection under this new iteration of the anti-terrorism measures.
“If so, the chief justice concerned constitutes a panel of five judges and forwards it to the designated authority, who then assigns the case to judge selected from that panel”.
A similar procedure will be adopted for prosecutors from a panel of five in consultation with the prosecutor general concerned. The new amendment also “enables the use of anonymity protocols” as well as virtual proceedings, besides advanced security technologies to safeguard all participants in the trial process.
Similarly, the identities of all those involved in the trial will remain hidden for security purposes and if a courtroom “is used for physical hearings, it shall be situated in secure premises, accessible only to judges, counsels, public prosecutors, witnesses, defence counsels and persons concerned with the trial”.
Under this bill, the “designated authority” shall be nominated by the provincial government and its identity “shall be kept confidential and shall only be communicated to the chief justice”.
The authority will consult with the chief justice for performing functions, such as deciding whether a case or a class of cases requires extraordinary protection measures, assigning cases to the judges; and consulting and coordinating with the Balochistan government.
“These measures aim to preserve judicial independence, uphold due process, and ensure the effective prosecution of terrorism related offences,” the bill read.
Opposition concerned
JI leader Maulana Hidayatur Rehman warned that the proposed law would undermine justice and human rights. “We will now serve justice through WhatsApp,” he quipped. According to the JI leader, if any innocent person were killed under the new law, the current government would be responsible. He said that instead of bringing this law, reforms should be introduced in the judiciary. “This law is a murder of human rights and justice,” he claimed.
However, Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti defended the bill. He said the counter-terrorism law would not be used against political workers, but solely to punish terrorists in accordance with the law. CM Bugti emphasised that the bill did not deny fair trial rights, and defence lawyers would have access to witnesses before judges.
On the issue of missing persons, the chief minister pledged that the government would permanently resolve the matter through legislation. “Any person arrested will be immediately reported to their family and the magistrate,” he assured. CM Bugti also announced strict action against poppy cultivation, revealing that 35,000 acres of poppy had already been destroyed this year. He vowed to confiscate lands given to Afghan cultivators and end illegal trawling in Makran, calling it “another form of terrorism”.
Levies-police merger
The provincial assembly also passed the Balochistan Forensic Science (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Balochistan Levies Force Bill 2025 under which the Levies would be merged into the Balochistan police.The Maulana argued that the bill required further consultations. Provincial Irrigation Minister Mir Sadiq Umrani, however, noted that the government had invited the opposition for dialogue but could not force their participation.

An egg was thrown at PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khanum on Friday while she was holding a press conference in Rawalpindi.

A statement released by the Rawalpindi Police said that the two arrested suspects were PTI supporters, who had travelled to Rawalpindi with other members of the All Government Employees Grand Alliance and the All Pakistan Clerks Association to protest for their unmet demands.
“The egging took place when Aleema Khan did not answer the questions raised by the two women,” the statement said. “They have been taken into police custody and sent to the Adiala checkpoint.”
The police added that immediately after throwing the egg, the two women tried to run away in their car. “However, their vehicle was surrounded by PTI supporters, some of whom also hurled pebbles at the car and broke the windscreen.”
Later, the PTI reposted a
video
of a white car on X, dubbing the incident a “shameful attack on Aleema Khan”.
In a statement posted in a preceding post, the party said PTI workers chased the women right after they hurled an egg at Aleema Khan but police “facilitated them in escaping along with a car as part of a plan”.
The statement also claimed that the women were sent to the media talk “as part of an agenda”. The party further stated that they had the registration number of the car seen in the video. It also demanded the registration of a first information report of the “attack on Aleema Khan”.
“We strongly condemn such dirty tricks in politics without discrimination. There is opposition in politics, but within the circle of civility,” said Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on X while criticising the PTI for the past actions of its own party supporters towards politicians.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said he unequivocally condemned the incident. “Politics must remain a contest of ideas, not of violence or hatred. We should all work to keep it healthy and respectful.”
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said the PTI faced the reckoning of its own past actions. Nonetheless, he said: “Politics runs on differences of opinion, but these differences should be expressed with political decorum. The expression of disagreement should not involve rudeness or incivility.”
Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Rafique slammed the incident as a “shameful, vile and crude act!”
“Shameful! The attack on Aleema Khan is appalling. Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity. Targeting women is the lowest form of politics and this cheap stunt must be condemned in the strongest words,” said Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon too condemned the attack, saying political differences should never justify disrespectful behaviour.
Aleema has been campaigning for her brother’s release since August 2024.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million
corruption
case and also faces pending trials in May 9 cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act.
In November 2014, a plot to attack Imran with rotten eggs and tomatoes was
foiled
in Gujranwala. Earlier that day, TV channels had reported that angry PML-N activists were purchasing and gathering rotten eggs, tomatoes and shoes to hurl at the PTI founder.
The eggs and tomatoes were shown covered with the slogan ‘
Ro Imran Ro
’ (Cry Imran Cry). When the news had aired, local police took action and arrested four PML-N activists who confessed that they had planned to target Imran on Nowshera Road.",2025-09-05,Tahir Naseer,1037,0.000138

The FIR claimed that after remaining silent out of fear of reprisal, the victim approached the police on Sept 11 and informed them about the matter.
The police then registered a case against the three accused under Section 375A.
A police spokesperson said the trio was arrested when they were trying to flee the city.
Police sources told
Dawn

Police sources said that on Friday, at around 3pm, a shopkeeper from Chak 174 Murad lured two children, aged 8 and 11, of the same area into his shop on the pretext of giving them candies and started doing indecent acts with them. However, the children’s father, who was passing by the shop after offering Friday prayers with a few of his friends, rescued them after hearing their hue and cry, while the shopkeeper managed to escape.
Police said the suspect was arrested and investigations were ongoing.

INJURED IN ROBBERY ATTEMPT:
A trader was seriously injured when he was allegedly shot by robbers for resisting a daylight robbery attempt in Faqirwali here on Saturday.
The victim’s family said that Iftikhar Ahmed of Chak 185/7R was returning to his grocery store in his car after delivering supplies, when two armed men on a motorcycle tried to stop his vehicle near Chak 192/7R.
They said the motorcyclists, who were robbers and were trying to rob Iftikhar, intercepted the car and opened fire on the vehicle when he drove away instead of stopping the vehicle.
According to the family, the bullets passed through the driver’s side door and hit Iftikhar in the stomach, seriously injuring him.
Police said that a case had been registered against the suspects, while investigating over the matter was ongoing.

recent visit
to China is expected to pave the way for significant defence agreements between Pakistan and its neighbour, including those related to advanced J-20 stealth aircraft and multi-domain command-and-control system.
During the visit, six memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were inked with Sindh government and business-to-business (B2B) partners in sectors such as agriculture, defence, energy, rail links, and farmer training, which will later be extended to other provinces.
This was disclosed by Senator Saleem Mandviwala at a press conference held at the Presidency on Friday.
He said President Zardari was the first head of state ever to be shown the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). The president was briefed on China’s latest aerospace capabilities, including the J-10 fighter jet, JF-17 Thunder co-production, J-20 stealth aircraft, UAV technologies, and multi-domain command-and-control systems.
“This visit could pave the way for future agreements for the procurement of advanced defence technologies from China,” he said, adding that Beijing possesses highly advanced defence technology that could benefit Pakistan.
He added that the visit had deepened strategic cooperation, expanded economic partnerships, and opened new avenues of bilateral collaboration between the two countries in diverse sectors.
Flanked by Presidential Spokesperson Murtaza Solangi and Press Secretary Daniyal Gilani, Mandviwala noted this was President Zardari’s second official visit to China since assuming office.“This time, he focused on meetings with mid-level Chinese officials to promote investment and cooperation,” he explained.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941379/opposition-parties-protest-quetta-suicide-blast-across-balochistan,Opposition parties protest Quetta suicide blast across Balochistan - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"QUETTA: Seven opposition parties on Thursday staged protests outside press clubs across Balo­chi­stan against the Sept 2 suicide
bombing
near Shah­wani Stadium, which occu­rred after a Balo­chi­stan National Party-Men­gal (BNP-M) public meeting.
Party leaders alleged that those behind the attack sought to eliminate the province’s “true political leadership”.
Large numbers of workers and supporters, carrying party flags and banners inscribed with anti-government slogans, gathered outside the Quetta Press Club.
The demonstration was led by Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal, BNP-M Senior Vice President Sajid Tareen Advocate, Awami National Party (ANP) Balochistan Presi­dent Asghar Khan Acha­kzai, Jamaat-i-Islami Balo­chistan Naib Emir Zahid Akhtar, and leaders from PTI and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM).
Mr Ziaratwal strongly condemned the suicide attack, warning that such assaults threatened all political parties.
“These attacks cannot force the true leadership to abandon its struggle for the rights of the people of Balochistan,” he said, vowing that PkMAP would continue its democratic struggle without fear.
BNP-M’s Sajid Tareen said party workers had gathered peacefully at Shahwani Stadium to pay tribute to the late Sardar Attaullah Mengal, yet were “punished” with violence that claimed the lives of 15 BNP workers and injured many more.
He said the province-wide wheel-jam and shutter-down strike had demonstrated the people’s rejection of “the rulers’ oppressive attitude”.
He added that his party would not bow down to anyone and would continue its struggle for the rights of people of Balochistan and its resources.
ANP’s Asghar Khan Achakzai said Baloch­istan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were facing systematic attempts to seize their natural resources.
He called for unity among political parties to protect provincial rights and condemned the
detention
of Dr Mahrang Baloch and other female activists, demanding their immediate release.
Jamaat-i-Islami’s Zahid Akhtar recalled the alliance’s long march to Islamabad, saying the federal government “trembled” at the sight of their protest.
He reaffirmed JI’s full support for the opposition alliance’s decisions. PTI and MWM leaders also addressed the gathering.
Similar protest demonstrations were held in Turbat, Gwadar, Loralai, Noshki and several other towns of Balochistan.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943572/us-wants-public-oversight-of-defence-security-budgets,"US wants public oversight of defence, security budgets - Newspaper - DAWN.COM","WASHINGTON: The United States has called on Pakistan to subject its defence and intelligence budgets to parliamentary or civilian public oversight, describing it as a key step to improve fiscal accountability and transparency.
The recommendation appears in the US Department of State’s 2025 Fiscal Transparency Report, released on Friday. The annual report reviews the openness of budgetary practices worldwide, assessing how governments publish, audit, and manage public funds.
“The military and intelligence budgets were not subject to adequate parliamentary or civilian public oversight,” the report stated in its Pakistan section. It added that “steps Pakistan could take to improve fiscal transparency include… subjecting the military and intelligence agencies’ budgets to parliamentary or civilian public oversight”.
The report also urged Pakistan to ensure the timely publication of its executive budget proposal. “The government… did not publish its executive budget proposal within a reasonable period,” the assessment noted, calling for earlier release of the document to enable informed debate and scrutiny.
On debt disclosure, the report found that “the government made only limited information on debt obligations, including major state-owned enterprise debt, publicly available.” It recommended “disclosing detailed information on government debt obligations, including for state-owned enterprises”.
Fiscal Transparency Report commends Pakistan’s audit institution, says it ‘meets international standards of independence’
While highlighting these shortcomings, the State Department acknowledged progress in other areas. It noted that Pakistan’s “enacted budget and end-of-year report [were] widely and easily accessible to the public, including online,” and that budget information was “generally reliable and subject to audit by the supreme audit institution.”
It also praised the independence of Pakistan’s supreme audit institution, saying it “met international standards of independence” and published audit findings within a reasonable period.
The report further observed that Pakistan “specified in law or regulation, and appeared to follow in practice, the criteria and procedures for awarding natural resource extraction contracts and licences,” and made “basic information on natural resource extraction awards publicly available”.
This year’s assessment echoes concerns raised in previous State Department reports, which have repeatedly pointed to gaps in debt transparency and the lack of legislative oversight of defence spending.
The report comes as Pakistan grapples with severe budgetary pressures. The government presented its budget for the fiscal year 2025-26, totaling Rs17.57 trillion. Of this, Rs9.7tr has been allocated for debt servicing, while Rs2.55tr has been set aside for defence — a nearly 20 per cent increase compared to last year.
The US recommendations are aimed at bolstering public trust and international confidence in Pakistan’s financial management at a time when external financing and investment remain critical to economic stability.
The 2025 Fiscal Transparency Report is a global assessment, evaluating fiscal practices in 140 governments and entities. It examines whether countries publish executive budgets in a timely manner, disclose debt obligations (including state-owned enterprises), maintain independent audit institutions, and ensure that sensitive spending — such as defence and intelligence — is subject to legislative or civilian oversight.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939545/us-lawmakers-briefed-on-flood-devastation-in-pakistan,US lawmakers briefed on flood devastation in Pakistan - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"WASHINGTON: The Pakistani American community has launched a campaign to support victims of the
2025 floods
, briefing US lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday about the scale of the disaster and urging international engagement.
The US-based Muslim Charity Helping Hand for Relief and Development (HHRD), largely run by Pakistani Americans, spent the day on Capitol Hill, highlighting the urgent need for food, clean water, medical assistance, and long-term rehabilitation for millions of people affected by the floods.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United States, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh, described the floods as “an unprecedented disaster that has set back economic growth, and continues to cause devastation across the country”.
Warning that next year’s monsoon could arrive earlier and bring even greater devastation, he called Pakistan “a frontline state” in the fight against climate change.
“Governments will do what they can, but all should come forward and help. The world must form a collective strategy to deal with recurring disasters,” he said.
Pakistani Americans highlight urgent need for food, clean water, medical aid and rehabilitation for millions hit by floods
The HHRD also announced dedicating an initial $5 million for relief and rehabilitation work and pledged to expand its efforts. The Pakistani community is holding fundraising events across the United States and Canada to supplement the relief efforts.
HHRD officials told lawmakers that the floods have directly affected more than five million people, with over 20 million at risk, underscoring the urgency of global support. Since late June, torrential rains and flash floods have battered Pakistan, especially Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan.
The floods have killed 881 people, injured more than 1,100, destroyed 11,000 homes, and damaged 250 bridges and 415 miles of roads. Some 1.2 million hectares have been submerged, including 853,000 hectares of cropland.
A UN report, released on Wednesday, warned that “the situation remains highly fluid, with reservoirs at full capacity and heavy rainfall forecast in early September, cautioning that new surges along the Chenab and other rivers could impact downstream districts in South Punjab”.
HHRD officials said their teams have been providing mobile clinics, water filtration systems, search-and-rescue operations, cooked meals, hygiene kits, mosquito nets, milk, and “Smile Boxes” for children. By early September, their relief teams had reached over 62,000 people across 13 districts, including Lahore, Sialkot, Swat, Neelum Valley, and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Officials emphasised that this initial $5m is a starting point and that the organisation intends to expand its reach in the coming weeks and months.
Ambassador Sheikh also highlighted the proactive spirit of Pakistanis, noting that citizens often take initiative in disaster response without waiting for government intervention.

During the hearing on Thursday, officials from the education department and the education works department appeared before the constitutional bench comprising Justice Zulfiqar Ali Sangi and Justice Riazat Ali Sahar.
The petitioner, Abdul Malik Zabiullah Jatoi, told the court that school buildings were destroyed in the
2022 floods
, and despite the passage of three years, the repair and construction work by the education works department had not been completed. As a result, students were forced to study at inappropriate locations without basic facilities, he added.
The honorable court reprimanded the officials, including the director of Elementary, Secondary and Higher Secondary Region Sukkur, Hafiz Shahabuddin, DEO Syed Ghulam Murtaza Shah, Education Works SDO Dost Ali Qazi and other officials concerned for their unsatisfactory answers.
The court has ordered them to provide a detailed report within one week on the restoration of schools and provision of basic facilities to the students.
The chief engineer of the education works Sukkur, and other responsible officials will have to appear before the court with the report at the next hearing, it said.
Notices to highway police
The same bench also admitted a petition against the alleged injustices by the National Highway police and issued notices to the nominated respondents.
Petitioners’ lawyers Shiraz Fazal Awaisi and Ahmed Mehran Goraya argued that trucks plying on the National Highway were stopped by the police for hours without any reason.
The lawyers claimed that the DIG of the National Highway police office issued an ambiguous list with registration numbers of hundreds of heavy vehicles, which are then forced to pull up at different weighbrides without any explanation. This causes traffic jams and an increase in accidents in night hours.
When the drivers questioned police officials, they were harassed and threatened with FIRs, they added. They also stated that the long delays prevented goods from reaching their destination on time, directly affecting the drivers’ livelihoods.
After hearing the arguments, the court issued notices to the DIG and SP of the National Highway police and others, directing them to appear before the court on Oct 15.
Encroachments at City Point
The bench also gave a deadline to the authorities concerned for the removal of encroachments from City Point in Sukkur, and for the construction of a service road and a U-turn.
It was seized with a petition filed by Faqir Athar Hussain Abro regarding encroachments at City Point.
Sukkur SSP Azhar Mughal, the Traffic SP, an NHA official, a representative of the deputy commissioner and officials from other departments concerned appeared before the bench.
The court asked the SP about the safety measures taken to prevent potential accidents.
He responded that he lacked the authority, office or staff, and that all authority was with the SSP operations.
Then the honorable court sought clarification from the SSP who stated that the problem was caused by the narrow road and passenger vehicles stopping there. However, traffic personnel had been deployed there, he said.
The NHA official informed the court that a road-widening scheme had been approved and work would be done according to the court’s orders once the district administration allotted the land.
He also assured the bench that a standard U-turn and service road would be constructed.
The court ordered the DC’s representative to hand over government land to the NHA if available, or to procure the same from private owners.
Justice Zulfiqar Ali Sangi remarked that illegal bus stops and encroachments at City Point must be removed.

The decision was taken during a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) in Islamabad, chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, according to a press release from the Finance Division.
The press release stated that the railways ministry submitted a summary on rail development and bridge financing agreements with the Reko Diq Mining Company, to provide $390m for laying a 1,350-kilometre railway track to transport large volumes of export material from mines in Balochistan.
“The ECC approved the proposal and directed the Ministry of Railways to share both agreement documents with the Finance Division for appraisal,” the press release read.
“It further instructed the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Finance to submit an update to the ECC by March next year on the execution and implementation of the project.”
Additionally, the ECC reviewed a summary from the petroleum ministry regarding approvals for agreements and financial commitments to fund the Reko Diq project, the press release read.
The ECC approved the proposed final terms of the agreements, with instructions that any material deviations in the final execution forms, determined by the project’s legal and financial consultants and certified by the mining company, would be brought back to the committee for approval.
According to the press release, Aurangzeb said, “The ECC’s approvals signify the government’s firm commitment to moving ahead with this landmark project, which has the potential to transform the economic landscape of Balochistan and generate far-reaching benefits for the people of Pakistan.
“The Reko Diq project will not only unlock one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper-gold deposits but also catalyse job creation, infrastructure development, and long-term socio-economic uplift across the region.”
In March this year, a formal feasibility study confirmed more than $60 billion worth of copper and gold reserves at the

outrage
with remarks aimed at Sindh — has not only angered the PPP but also triggered a war of words between the two coalition partners on social media.
A Senate standing committee recently summoned YouTuber Rizwan Razi, also known as Razi Dada, and grilled him for making derogatory remarks about the people of Sindh. The panel subsequently directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to block his YouTube channel over what it termed “hate speech” against the people of Sindh.
Committee members also questioned how a presenter who appeared on the state-run
PTV News
could make such remarks on his personal YouTube channel.
In one of his recent vlogs, Razi considered close to the CM made unsavoury, racist remarks.
CM Maryam backs Razi’s apology after PPP terms his remarks a slight to Sindh
However, the Punjab government and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz openly came out in support of Razi, with a social media campaign launched to express solidarity with him.
The PPP strongly objected to the Maryam administration’s stance, questioning how it could support a man who had openly demonstrated hatred toward Sindh and fuelled provincialism.
“It is very unfortunate that the PML-N and the Punjab government have launched a campaign in support of a sick man,” Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon said in a
post
on Thursday.
He added that this sent a negative message to Sindh, accusing the Punjab government of trying to divert public attention from its poor performance during the floods.
PPP Punjab executive member Ahsan Rizvi also condemned the campaign by PML-N-backed X accounts, calling it “absolutely unacceptable.”
“It is regrettable that the PML-N’s social media is supporting a biased YouTuber. Describing someone who engages in blackmail and ethnic prejudice as a journalist is an insult to journalism,” Mr. Rizvi said.
The controversy has become a hot topic on social media, with many users urging the Punjab government not to support an “anti-Sindh man” merely because he targets the PML-N’s opponents.
In a statement, CM Maryam Nawaz said that even if Razi had used an inappropriate phrase, he showed “good character” by apologizing with an open heart.
“Those who fuel provincial prejudice and spread hate-filled narratives are never questioned. Rejecting the politics of hatred and the narrative of provincial division is the only way to make Pakistan stronger,” she said.
Punjab Information and Culture Minister Azma Bokhari also stressed that her party had never engaged in the politics of provincialism, nor had it played the river-or-dam card.

The situation intensified after Indian authorities issued alerts regarding rising water levels at Ganda Singh Wala and Ferozepur two days ago, prompting renewed evacuations along the Sutlej River.
Despite some areas witnessing a slight recession in water levels, the overall flood threat remains severe, with rescue and relief operations stretched across multiple districts.
At Panjnad Headworks on the Chenab River, water discharge surged to an exceptionally high level, crossing 668,000 cusecs. Between Wednesday morning and early Thursday, the flow increased by 100,000 cusecs, triggering mass evacuations in Alipur tehsil.
In a late night development, a protective dyke near the city of Shujabad collapsed for a second time, inundating communities along the river bank.

Punjab Emergency Service Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer said over 13,600 people were rescued in the past three days in Multan alone, with more than 25,000 relocated. Across the province, more than 362,000 people have been evacuated using 139 rescue boats.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said four helicopters and 2,000 tents have been deployed to Jalalpur Pirwala, where reli­­ef distribution continues with army support.
Rahim Yar Khan Deputy Commissioner Khurrum Parvaiz told
Dawn
that water levels were rising downstream of Panjnad, prompting evacuation operations in the riverbed areas of Khanpur and Liaquatpur. He said around 12,000 people had been evacuated, six relief camps established and 1,800 tents distributed among flood-affected families.
The deputy commissioner added that all dy­­k­­es in the district were intact, with 660,000 cu­­secs passing through Chachran Sharif, and as­sured there was no threat to nearby localities.
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had ord­ered the removal of the Assistant Commis­sioner of Jalalpur Pirwala over negligence after a rescue boat capsized. She added that water levels at Muhammad Wala and Sher Shah bridges had fallen below critical levels, ruling out immediate breaching of dykes.
Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman visited Panjnad Headworks, where he was briefed on inflows and discharges. Officials confirmed that evacuation of low-lying areas was ongoing, with all embankments under constant monitoring.
Meanwhile, officials said Mangla Dam is 90 per cent full, Tarbela 100pc, India’s Bhakra 90pc, Pong 99pc and Thein 97pc, increasing downstream pressure.
Balochistan rains
NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik said on Thursday that Pakistan was facing the final monsoon spell of this season, adding that during the past two days, the floodwater heading south was “losing steam”,

reported.
“The water in our rivers came in two layers,” he explained. “The first is hitting Guddu Barrage, the other is at Panjnad. Based on this information, we expect that it will stabilise in the next two to three days.”
Several areas of Balochistan have been lashed by torrential monsoon rains over the past two days, triggering flash floods and prompting the PDMA to issue an alert on Thursday. District administrations have been directed to take urgent measures to protect residents from possible devastation.
Officials said seasonal rivers and streams were already carrying heavy rainwater, with the risk of severe flooding if showers continued in the catchment areas.
At Hub Dam, water levels rose rapidly to 338 feet, just one foot short of its full capacity of 339 feet. A senior Irrigation Department official said the spillways could be opened at any time, and people living along the Hub Riv­er had been warned to move to safer locations.
Meanwhile, the Balochistan government has completed arrangements along the left bank of the Indus River in anticipation of floodwaters expected to arrive from Punjab’s Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers within the next few days.
Rescue teams, boats and heavy machinery have been deployed in the border areas of Nasirabad division, including Nasirabad, Usta Muhammad, Sohbatpur and Jaffarabad.
“For the past week, rescue staff and equipment have been positioned along the Sindh-Balochistan border,” an official said.
Balochistan Irrigation Minister Sadiq Um­­rani told the provincial assembly that preparations were in place to shift people from vulnerable areas to safety. He added that an understanding had been reached with the Sindh government that no embankments would be deliberately breached if water reached dangerous levels. “If over 1.1 million cusecs flow through the Indus, the chief ministers of both provinces will decide further action,” he said.
Balochistan PDMA Director General Jahanzeb Khan said 16 flood control centres had been set up across four districts of Nasirabad division, operating round the clock. Rescue and relief arrangements, including provision of essential goods, had been finalised to assist displaced families.

“The government manipulated sugar prices by managing the supply of imported sugar verses locally produced sugar. As a result, Rs300-400 billion were taken out of the pockets of ordinary citizens and transferred into the hands of sugar mill owners,” Mr Abbasi said, addressing a news conference.
He added that government policies had provided undue benefits to sugar mill owners, while the beverages industry and other factories were forced to buy sugar at higher rates.
He claimed that even today an additional Rs1bn was going to sugar mill owners through the sale of costly sugar in the retail markets. The government, parliament and price control committees have failed to protect the consumers from this extortion.
“This is the state of governance in country,” Mr Abbasi remarked, adding, “The price of sugar has increased by 50 per cent in one year.”
Accuses NAB of protecting corrupt business practices instead of holding mill owners accountable
The former premier asked: “Will anyone answer for this sugar price hike?” He said that those in the government should at least admit their mistake, adding that NAB’s job seemed to be protecting corr­u­pt business practices in the country. The APP convener further said that the job of governments was to provide facilities to the people, but, successive governments had failed and caused economic hardships.
He said that the time to control markets through administrative efforts was over and added that if the price of sugar increases by just one rupee, Rs7bn are taken away from people.
He pointed out that there was a sugar monitoring committee of the cabinet and at least seven to eight other committees responsible for sugar price control.
“Despite so many committees, the price of sugar went up. When there was already a shortage in the country, why did the government allow its export?” he asked.
“The strange part is that while the private sector was exporting sugar, the government was importing it— and at prices higher than the international market,” he added. He concluded that sugar had not only become more expensive but had also grown scarce in the markets.

against Mazari, her spouse, Zainab Janjua and several PTI-linked lawyers, including Naeem Panjhuta and Fateullah Barkiunder, under anti-terror laws after the IHCBA alleged that the bar leadership was “assaulted” by the lawyers, the suspects had also raised slogans against state institutions.
Mazari and the other booked lawyers had staged a protest on the premises of the IHC to oppose the
suspension
of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from judicial work.
The hearing was presided over by PHC judge Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah, who granted a protective bail to the couple and asked them to appear before a relevant court by October 9.
Mazari and her spouse appeared in the court today along with their lawyers
Ataullah Kundi, Jahanzeb Mehsud, and Tariq Afghan.
Meanwhile, Additional Attorney General Sanaullah appeared on behalf of the IGCBA.
Advocate Ataullah Kundi told Justice Shah that “a case was registered against the two petitioners in Islamabad,” to which he asked whether both of the petitioners were lawyers.
Kundi responded: “Yes, both of them are lawyers and would like to appear in the court.”
Addressing the petitioners, Justice Shah asked if this was their first time in Peshawar, to which Mazari replied in the affirmative, prompting Justice Shah to remark, “At least you came to Peshawar on the pretext of the FIR.”
“You people never come to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa anyway,” he added.
Advocate Kundi argued in front of Justice Shah that “Imaan Mazari is the voice of the people of KP and Balochistan,” adding that she was also a social worker in Islamabad.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945111/12-killed-42-injured-in-balochistan-accidents,"12 killed, 42 injured in Balochistan accidents - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","GWADAR/QUETTA: Twelve people were killed and 42 others, including women and children, injured in three separate road accidents in Panjgur, Pishin and Lasbela districts of Balochistan on Saturday.
Officials said the first incident occurred in Panjgur when a passenger coach caught fire after colliding with a mini-truck carrying Iranian-smuggled petrol on the CPEC highway, about 14km from Panjgur town.
“The passenger coach coming from Karachi was on its way to Panjgur. When it reached the Zamzama Hotel area, it was hit by a Zambad mini-truck coming from the opposite direction,” a senior levies officer told
Dawn.
The collision caused both the coach and the petrol-laden truck to catch fire, engulfing the vehicles in flames.
Fire tenders were dispatched from Panjgur but by the time they arrived, the blaze had consumed the vehicles. “Six passengers travelling in the coach and two others in the mini-truck could not be rescued and were burnt to death,” an official of the district administration said, adding that two other people sustained burn injuries. One of them was a passer-by who caught fire when the vehicles collided.
Rescue and levies teams rushed to the scene, but it took nearly four hours to extinguish the fire. The bodies were retrieved from the wreckage and shifted, along with the two injured, to the Government Teaching Hospital in Panjgur. The injured were later moved to Karachi.
The deceased passengers of the coach, all residents of Khuzdar district, were identified as Jamil Ahmed, Inayatullah, Adeel, Alam, Salman and Amir. The two deceased in the mini-truck were identified as Abdul Razzaq and Fahad.
In another accident, four people were killed and 25 others injured, including women and children, when a Quetta-bound passenger coach coming from Islamabad overturned near the Khanozai area in Pishin district due to speeding.
Assistant Commissioner Karizat said the accident occurred when the coach lost control and overturned. Rescue teams of the Levies force rushed to the site, recovered the bodies and the injured, and shifted them to a nearby health facility.
“We have received four bodies and 25 injured in the hospital,” a hospital official said, adding that the condition of five injured was critical. They were referred to the Civil Hospital in Quetta as they had suffered multiple serious injuries.
In a separate incident on the Makran Coastal Highway near Lyari, more than 15 Hindu pilgrims travelling from Karachi to Hinglaj Nani Mandir were injured when their coach overturned due to speeding.
Women and children were among the injured. They were initially treated at the District Headquarters Hospital in Uthal, while the critically injured were later shifted to Karachi.

M-6 Motorway
at Jamshoro via the Kirthar Mountain Range.
Officials said the M-10 project is a mega initiative that has evolved from a  simple bypass upgrade. It involves upgrading the Northern Bypass and constructing a new 134-kilometer six-lane  motorway through the Kirthar Range.
Additionally, a 23-kilometer stretch will be upgraded to a  six-lane road, transforming the entire route from Karachi Port to M-6 in  Jamshoro into a high-capacity motorway.
The project was discussed on Wednesday at a meeting between Communication Minister Aleem Khan and Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah at CM House.
Nespak is conducting a feasibility study on the proposed 134km M-10 project, Communications Minister Aleem Khan tells CM Murad
The meeting was informed that the M-10 project was currently in the feasibility study stage, being conducted by National Engineering Services Pakistan (Nespak).
Federal Minister Aleem Khan stated that the project’s core objective was to decongest Karachi by creating a direct high-speed link between the port and the national motorway network. The chief minister welcomed the federal government’s support as the federal minister assured him that the communications ministry and the NHA were committed to completing both M-6 and M-10 projects in a timely and transparent manner.
Earlier in May, the federal communication minister had said that construction of both the M-6 and M-10 motorways would now begin simultaneously, with the aim of connecting them directly to Karachi Port.
It may be noted that the Senate Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Special Initiatives had expressed serious concerns over NHA’s performance on the M-6 project and urged them to commence work without further delay by October, warning that the matter would be referred to the Upper House for intervention.
Welcoming the federal government’s support, the chief minister said that both projects were “vital not only for Sindh but for the entire country’s economy”.
Rs363bn for M-6
The chief minister said that M-6 would unlock opportunities for the youth of interior of Sindh through enhanced connectivity, while M-10 would “resolve Karachi’s traffic bottlenecks once and for all”.
A statement issued from CM House said that Federal Communications Secretary Ali Sher informed the meeting that the M-6 project had received final approval under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) with a budget of Rs363 billion.
He said that the project would be implemented in five phases by the National Highway Authority, with the Islamic Development Bank committing to fund two sections and a Chinese company expressing interest in undertaking all five sections.
The meeting was told that the M-6 project would complete Pakistan’s north-south motorway backbone, linking Peshawar to Karachi, and enhance trade, logistics, and regional development. The project is expected to reduce travel time, improve safety, and facilitate port-to-upcountry connectivity.
The meeting was attended among others by Provincial Ministers Sharjeel Inam Memon, Syed Nasir Hussain Shah and Ali Hassan Zardari, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Planning and Development Chairman Najam Shah and Secretary to CM Raheem Shaikh.

occupied/encroached
” land of the varsity vacated.
The members of the syndicate also decided that the university would seek assistance from concerned government departments in this regard and hire an “experienced” legal firm to pursue cases in the court of law.
The meeting, chaired by Vice Chancellor Dr Khalid Iraqi, decided to set up a five-member committee comprising syndicate members — former KU VC Prof Mohammad Qaiser, former Karachi Commissioner Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui, Prof Solaha Rehman, KU financial officer Syed Jahanzeb and director legal Asif Mukhtar — to assist the legal firm.
Other decisions taken in the meeting include the posting of patrolling staff.
No precise data about encroached land was presented before special syndicate meeting, sources say
In his remarks, VC Iraqi stated that it’s the first university syndicate meeting ever on the land issue, while vowing to protect “every inch of the university land”.
However, sources regretted that neither precise data on encroachment and land occupation was presented in the meeting nor members questioned the “administrative wisdom” to hire a legal firm, given the fragile financial situation of the university.
The decision, they said, indicated failure of the university’s legal department in protecting its land in the court of law.
Dawn
contacted multiple administrative officials and senior teachers about the encroached land data. While no response was received on the specific information, they all agreed that “a significant portion of the university land is either occupied or encroached upon”.
They also shared that successive university administrations had dealt with this problem, but without much success.
The sources said official documents showed that the university was allotted 1,279.04 acres spread over Deh Safooran, Dozen, Songal and Gujhro, under Scheme No. 33.
According to these documents, the land was handed over to the KU Registrar on Nov 13, 1954. Three years later, the collector of Karachi confirmed the acquisition of land for the construction of the university.
In 2009, the record’s verification was again carried out by revenue officials.
The sources said many of these sites had been under litigation for a long time. This included the site where the Karachi Development Authority laid its claim and recently attempted to take it over. It had been under litigation since 1999.
The sources said the encroachments/occupied areas mentioned in documents included the encroachments near Khatm-i-Nubawat Chowk (opposite Kaneez Fatima Society) and in front of the Sheikh Zayed centre and the Silver Jubilee Gate.
A sports pavilion in front of the Staff Gate was also built on the university land.
“For decades, the university has been struggling to protect its land. One major reason for its failure is the absence of trained and equipped security staff, apart from rampant malpractices within the ranks of university officials,” shared a senior teacher.
The KU vice chancellor was not available for comments.

suspended
, the Punjab officials tasked with maintaining supplies of commodities and regulating their prices deny that there is any ban on inter-province movement of grain.
Speaking to the media after a ceremony to distribute checks to flood victims in Dera Ismail Khan, the KP governor regretted the reports that Punjab has banned movement of wheat to other provinces as flour millers from KP, Punjab and Sindh are protesting against the move.
Punjab officials deny that they are restricting inter-province movement of wheat. However, they do admit that they have set up check-posts on inter-province roads to curb ‘unusual’ and ‘suspicious’ grain movement.
The government has also reportedly banned use of wheat in the poultry feed mills as Pakistan Poultry Association chairman Abdul Basit has demanded that the government allow duty-free import of maize to save the industry from the feed crisis caused by the use of grain by the feed mills.
Officials say check points set up to curb ‘unusual’ and ‘suspicious’ movement of the staple
The Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA) has already decried the provincial government’s “unannounced” ban on wheat and flour movement, terming the move unconstitutional and against the policy of deregulation.
According to PFMA Punjab Chairman Riazullah Khan, check posts have been set up at exit points of the province to block the transportation of wheat and flour to other regions. He termed these measures against the spirit of deregulation, under which the trade and movement of wheat were to remain unrestricted.
Khan said that wheat stocks in the country were sufficient to meet food requirements and warned that unnecessary restrictions often become the root cause of crises.
He said that provinces including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, and parts of Sindh rely heavily on wheat supplies from Punjab and the disruption was creating a sense of deprivation and unrest among smaller provinces, while also threatening the financial stability of the flour milling industry, which has invested billions of rupees nationwide.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940105,Deadly arrogance - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"RELIGIONS, particularly Islam, are supposed to address the ethical ills that afflict mankind. In fact, in Islamic tradition,
akhlaq
(morals, ethics) is a well-developed science, deriving lessons from the Quran and ahadith on how to deal with ethical situations across the spectrum of life.
Moreover, the Holy Prophet (PBUH), whose noble birth we celebrate today, is considered the perfect ethical exemplar, who taught us how to behave in family settings and in the workplace, during war and during peace, individually and socially, etc.
Amongst the biggest ethical evils, as per the Quran and the teachings of the Blessed Prophet, are arrogance and pride, which, unfortunately, are found in abundance in all settings. This can range from states practising arrogance, for example, when the powerful and unaccountable unleash death and destruction upon innocents, as Israel and the US are currently doing in Gaza. It can also include how we treat those with less power and money than us, for example domestic staff, street vendors etc.
The Quran is very clear on how arrogance is a reviled trait in the eyes of the Almighty. One of the archetypes of arrogance repeatedly mentioned in the Holy Book is pharaoh, whose haughty utterances and actions are thoroughly condemned. For example, in Surah Naziyat pharaoh, a mere mortal, boasts that “I am your lord, most high.” Elsewhere, in Surah Zukhruf, pharaoh wrongly claims that Egypt’s mighty Nile flows under his feet. Compare this to the clear warning in Surah Isra, where man is commanded not to walk on the earth arrogantly.
Authentic ahadith are equally critical of the arrogant. As per one hadith, it is stated that “there is a special section for the arr­ogant people in hell”. At another point it is stated that “the one who is arrogant will be degraded by Allah”, while yet another tradition warns that “the worst kind of pride is considering the creatures lowly”.
The Holy Prophet (PBUH) treated the weakest with dignity.
Throughout his blessed life, the Holy Prophet displayed disdain for arrogance, and preferred humility and simplicity to vanity and ostentation. In fact, apart from his insistence on
tauheed
(monotheism), the tribal aristocrats of Makkah took exception to the fact that he treated the weakest individuals in that society — slaves, women, children, orphans, those without strong tribal affiliation — with dignity and respect.
How could a ‘low-born’ slave be considered equal in the eyes of the Almighty to a ‘high-born’ merchant of Makkah belonging to a powerful tribe, they wondered. For them, this amounted to ‘blasphemy’. Sadly, these pre-Islamic prejudices, with roots in
jahiliya
, have survived, as even in our society caste, tribe and financial position can define an individual’s status in society, rather than the strength of their character.
In fact, these prejudices are not limited to tribal or rural parts of the country; such attitudes thrive even in the cities where wealth — gained by means fair or foul — is the marker of success and status. The poor are an afterthought, not worthy of human dignity. Islam strongly condemns such vile attitudes.
In the view of the Most High, the best among humanity are the “most righteous”, while in a hadith, those with the best character are equated with those with the best faith. In the divine hierarchy, money, family connections and other ephemeral affiliations have no value; only a person’s character counts. And nothing destroys character like arrogance.
The most knowledgeable individual to ever walk the earth — the Holy Prophet, described as the ‘City of knowledge’ in a hadith — was a picture of humility. Thr­toughout history, even apart from prophets, the people of knowledge have always been humble. When they reflect on the realities of the universe — the vastn­ess of the cosmos, the ancientness of time, the deeper mysteries of creation — they realise they know nothing, and prostrate before Allah Almighty, who “tau­ght man which he knew not”. When the people of knowledge express their total helplessness and humility before the Most High, on what basis do the arrogant walk haughtily on the land?
And when arrogance mixes with ignorance, the results are lethal. After all, as per a saying of Hazrat Ali, “ignorance is death for the living”. Unfortunately, in our society the arrogant and the ignorant — the ‘living dead’ in the light of this saying — appear to dominate, while the people of knowledge are brushed aside as weak and unworthy, or harassed for speaking the truth.
But we must remember that arrogance is a death sentence in this world and the next, as the fate of pharaoh and those of his ilk demonstrates. The only solution, as per the Quran and the Holy Prophet’s example, lies in humility and character-building, while giving dignity and respect to all, regardless of ‘social’ and monetary status.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941095/pakistan-better-off-than-last-floods-but-fiscally-bound,"Pakistan ‘better off’ than last floods, but fiscally bound - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","• HRW calls on government to address unchecked development amid changing climate
• HRCP highlights plight of climate refugees
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has ente­red this year’s
flood season
with more substantial economic buffers than it had before the 2022-23 floods, but the country’s improved macroeconomic situation comes with new constraints, according to a `targeted analysis’ carried out by the Famine Early Warning Systems (FEWS) Network.
The analysis expects that the 2025 floods will primarily drive short-term, localised,
food insecurity
among flood-affected households.
Produced at the request of the US government as a part of FEWS NET’s global coverage, the report notes that this time, the flood response will be constrained by limited fiscal intervention capacity, in contrast to the emergency subsidies in 2022-23.
The 37-month IMF Extended Fund Facility explicitly prohibits the use of untargeted subsidies and market interventions that were used during the previous floods.
According to the analysis, increases of eight to 10 per cent in wheat prices are expected in coming months due to flood-related market supply disruptions, but will likely return to near-normal levels once affected roads are restored.
However,
production losses
of Kharif season crops due to flooding are expected, particularly for rice, sugarcane, cotton, and vegetables.
The government can deploy foreign reserves in the event that emergency imports are needed, and negative food inflation provides a substantial cushion against the level of price spikes that devastated household purchasing power in 2022, according to the analysis.
The ongoing floods are expected to affect the Kharif season, which started in April. While complete information on the extent of crop damage due to flooding is not yet available, early findings indicate a significant localised impact.
They are expected, however, to affect household income from agricultural labour and crop sales, particularly in Punjab, the report warns.
HRW report
In a separate
statement
, global rights watchdog Human Rights Watch has called upon the government to address unchecked development amid a changing climate.
It noted that unchecked development exacerbates the effects of floods, and one representative example is the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project, which the government launched in August 2020 to address Lahore’s many problems — pollution, sewage, water, housing and employment — while aiming to revive the city’s “lost glory”.
This is just the latest in a string of failures by successive governments in Pakistan to enact needed reforms and policies to regulate development, HRW said.
It assailed the government over its history of conducting “poor quality environmental assessments for politically connected infrastructure projects”.
“In this case, it ignored warnings by independent environmental activists and experts who called the project ecologically and financially unviable and argued that building barrages and other dams on the river and replacing farmland with paved concrete could swell water levels upstream and cause flooding.”
Today, most of the area earmarked for the project is submerged, along with parts of Lahore city itself, HRW regretted.
Protecting the vulnerable
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), has called for expanding the rescue and relief operations that are currently underway, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable segments.
In a statement
issued

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942514/leopard-on-the-loose-in-muzaffarabad-captured-after-36-hours,Leopard on the loose in Muzaffarabad captured after 36 hours - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"MUZAFFARABAD: A leopard that had played “hide and seek” with residents of the AJK capital for more than 36 hours was finally captured on Tuesday afternoon, bringing much-needed relief to the panicked populace.
The drama began late Sunday night, when reports emerged on social media that a leopard had been spotted in the Sathra area. Residents fanned out with torches and mobile phone lights to trace it, but in vain.
CCTV footage that surfaced later showed the animal roaming through Madina Market, a busy commercial hub about a kilometre away, without coming into contact with night watchmen or passers-by.
On Monday morning, the big cat was sighted in the Central Plate neighbourhood near Jinnah Dental Hospital, where it leapt past a female resident and crouched in an open plot beside her house. “Surprisingly, it was not violent but friendly,” she recalled.
Another resident, Raja Asad Khan, described his unnerving face-to-face encounter when the leopard jumped into his house. “As I stepped out of the washroom, I suddenly found myself staring at it. I swiftly locked the room, retreated to safety and alerted emergency services,” he said, adding that the animal appeared overwhelmed rather than aggressive. “It did not deliberately target my house. It was simply fleeing human pursuit.”
Police and wildlife teams rushed to the spot, but the leopard slipped away again, sparking conflicting reports about its whereabouts and a flood of memes on social media.
Later in the day, the animal entered a scrap warehouse along Plate Road owned by Matiullah Khan, an Afghan national settled in Muzaffarabad. His children managed to lock it in a room, but the leopard forced its way out through a narrow opening and climbed onto the roof before disappearing into a three-foot-wide alley, hemmed in by tall buildings, leading to a basement where it eventually got stuck.
Wildlife teams attempted to tranquilize it with a dart gun, but the confined space made it nearly impossible to strike properly. By Tuesday morning, the leopard had become visibly stressed and vets advised against sedation, fearing it could prove fatal.
At this stage, Mr Khan volunteered to take matters into his own hands.
Donning a helmet and gloves provided by the wildlife department, he crawled into the cavity with ropes as cameras rolled.
“It attacked me thrice, but I didn’t give up. I wanted to rid this city, which gave me livelihood and respect, of fear and panic,” he later told
Dawn
.
With assistance from wildlife watchers Junaid Akram and Raja Mudassar and local volunteer Hasnain Ali Khokhar, the leopard was finally subdued and dragged into the open, before being shifted to an iron cage.
The animal, believed to be aged between 1.5 and 2.5 years, was later transported to the wildlife department’s rehabilitation centre in Chela neighbourhood.
“We will keep it under observation to monitor its behaviour, following which it will be released into its natural habitat,” said Wildlife Monitoring Officer Dr Shaista Ali.
“At the moment, it is healthy and active, but if its condition deteriorates we will transfer it to Islamabad,” she told
Dawn
.
Since the leopard had shown little aggression during its early encounters and it remained unclear how it had strayed into the city, many residents speculated it might have been a pet.
Dr Ali, however, said it was too early to either confirm or rule out that possibility.

The petitions, available with
Dawn.com
, named the IHC, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and the Federation of Pakistan as respondents and have been filed under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
Article 184(3) sets out the SC’s original jurisdiction and enables it to assume jurisdiction in matters involving a question of “public importance” with reference to the “enforcement of any of the fundamental rights” of Pakistan’s citizens.
In their petitions, the judges moved the SC to declare that administrative powers could not be “deployed to undermine or trump the judicial powers” of the high court judges.
They further asked the apex court to declare that a chief justice of the high court was “not authorised to constitute benches or transfer cases” once a high court bench had been assigned a case.
Today’s development has once again highlighted deep fissures within the IHC, which gained prominence when Justice Dogar was appointed as the high court’s chief justice.
The fissures in the high court can be traced back to March last year, when in a
startling letter
written to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) members, the five IHC judges, along with Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir had accused the country’s intelligence apparatus of interference in judicial affairs, including attempts to pressure judges through abduction and torture of their relatives and secret surveillance inside their homes.
Barrister Rida Hosain
said
on X that the petition was an act of “Independent judges fighting back”.
“Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi gave his consent for the transfer of judges, including (IHC Chief Justice) Dogar, to the IHC and ‘welcomed’ the transfer,” Hosain said.
“Meanwhile, Chief Justice Dogar’s milestones include suspending and obstructing judges from their judicial duties,” she added.
Advocate Abdul Moiz Jafferii, speaking to
Dawn.com
on the development, said: “The toying with the constitutional order with the 26th amendment and the later transfer appointment of a judge from Lahore into the Islamabad High Court, which we were asked to rejoice, is bearing fruit.”
“Gone is any small semblance of judicial order”
“Gone is any small semblance of judicial order. This could all have been prevented from happening if the Supreme Court and our senior lords had united when the amendment was being passed in the dead of night,” Jafferii said.
“It could have been corrected if the Supreme Court had intervened in a timely manner once the amendment was challenged,” he added.
“The desire is to denude the will of the people — and unless our Supreme Court and its constitutional benches see their own powerless futures in the faces of these five brave judges — we will get more of the same going forward,” the advocate added.
Barrister Asad Rahim Khan told
Dawn.com
: “At a time of such widespread regression for the legal system, the Islamabad High Court has again burnished its reputation for judicial independence.”
“The petitions of the five judges require immediate resolution by the Supreme Court, given just how much its recent verdicts have whittled down the judiciary’s autonomy,” he added.
Taking to X, Advocate Rabbiya Bajwa, former vice president of the Lahore High Court Bar Association, said, “The brave and principled judges of the Islamabad High Court are standing firm against all odds.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940610/man-killed-in-kaghan-bear-attack,Man killed in Kaghan bear attack - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"MANSEHRA: A black bear killed a man in the Paras area of Kaghan Valley on Monday.
“The bear entered the populated area in search of food and attacked the man. Despite repeated requests, the wildlife department has failed to prevent wild animals from straying into villages in the area,” Mohammad Basharat, a resident, told reporters.
The victim, Fazlur Rehman, was taking his herd to nearby fields for grazing when the bear attacked him, leaving him critically injured. He was rushed to a local health facility, where doctors pronounced him dead. His body was later handed over to the family.
Mr Basharat said residents had earlier sought the wildlife department’s help after wild animals repeatedly killed their goats and cattle, but no action was taken.
“Now a human has been killed in broad daylight. If preventive measures are not adopted, more lives may be lost in attacks by wild creatures,” he warned.
The dense alpine forests are the natural habitat of leopards, black and brown bears, which often descend onto populated areas in search of food.
According to the wildlife department, these animals mostly attack livestock, though female bears can turn aggressive if their cubs are threatened or stolen.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945368/pak-saudi-pact-aims-to-contain-israeli-threat-ex-senator,Pak-Saudi pact aims to contain Israeli threat: ex-senator - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: A new defence
pact
between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia was forged in response to a perceived rising threat of “Greater Israel” aggression and a consequential loss of confidence in American security guarantees in the Middle East, former Pakistani Senator Mushahid Hussain said on Sunday.
Speaking at the launch of a new research report in Islamabad, Hussain identified the agreement’s two key architects as Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman. He asserted that the pact would serve as a bulwark to contain what he described as an “emerging Indo-Israeli Axis”.
Senator Hussain, who heads the Pakistan-China Institute think tank, pres­ented these views during the release of the report “Pakistan & Saudi Arabia: Mus­lim World’s Strategic Security Partners”.
He cited three primary reasons for the timing and necessity of the landmark defence agreement. The first, he expl­a­ined, was Israeli
aggression
against Qatar, a US-allied nation where representatives from both Israel and the US had previously met the Palestinian resistance movement, Hamas. He said this demonstrated Israel’s intention to impose regional hegemony through military force.
The second reason, according to him, is the void left by Washington’s failure to act, positioning Pakistan as a viable security alternative in the Middle East.
Mushahid says deal reflects waning confidence in US security guarantees for Muslim nations
“Pakistan emerged as a security altern­ative in the Middle East after the vacuum created by the US failure to prevent or oppose the Israeli attack on Qatar,” Mr Hussain said, while calling this a “turning point” after the US failed play the role of providing protection, “thereby indicating that the United States could no longer be relied upon as a protector of the security of friendly Muslim countries in the region”.
Consequently, he argued, regional powers were seeking new alliances. “The Mus­lim countries in the region have now sta­r­t­ed looking at new security options,” Mr Hussain said, adding that Pakistan’s hist­o­ry of defence cooperation made it “a feas­ible alternative to provide effective secur­i­ty for Muslim states, as and when needed”.
The third driver for the agreement, he said, was Pakistan’s demonstration of its military capabilities when it successfully defended itself against Indian aggression in a future conflict.
“Pakistan has proved its muscle in the military domain when it successfully def­ended against Indian aggression in
May
, in fact, giving a bloody nose to a numerically superior and a larger and stronger adversary,” he said, adding that this was “a fact that has been confirmed by none other than President Trump”.
This proved “Pakistan has demonstrated the will, skill and capability and the political and military strength to take on and defeat India,” he said. He claimed that during that conflict, Israeli Harop drones were used against Pakistan, and Pakistani forces shot down over 80 of them, showcasing both defensive and offensive prowess.
In its new proactive role, he said, Pak­istan and Saudi Arabia have established a new template for regional security, creating a “natural combination of Pakistan’s military muscle and Saudi Arabia’s economic strength to provide for deterrence against any kind of aggression”.

anti-dengue campaign
.
District Health Authority Chief Executive Officer Dr Ehsan Ghani told
Dawn
that show-cause notices had been issued to more than 448 workers, and in the initial phase, action was taken against 12 workers under departmental rules.
He said the employees were dismissed under the PEDA Act 2006 for failing to meet the targets in the dengue campaign and for continued inefficiency.
An inquiry is also underway against other sanitary staff accused of negligence in the dengue campaign. He said the District Health Authority has formed a three-member inquiry committee headed by the district health officer.
The dismissed employees, he said, had been negligent and mostly failed to perform the work assigned to stop the spread of the dengue virus. Targets were assigned to all employees, but some remained inefficient despite repeated warnings.
He said the anti-dengue drive is continuing in the district, and teams have been deployed to fumigate sensitive union councils. All staff have been instructed to speed up the door-to-door surveillance campaign.
He urged citizens to cooperate with health authority teams so that the number of dengue patients could be reduced in the coming days. He said it was the peak season for the dengue virus, and efforts were being made to stop its spread to other areas.
At present, he said, 20 new dengue patients had been reported, bringing the total number of patients in the district to 394, which is fewer than in the past two years.
He expressed hope that the number of patients would decline in the coming days.
On the fourth day of the HPV vaccination campaign, Dr Ehsan Ghani said that 78 per cent of the target had been achieved on Thursday.
The campaign will continue until September 27 to immunise girls aged 9 to 14 against cervical cancer.
He said this initiative is part of a nationwide effort to protect women from a serious health threat. The district-wide goal is to vaccinate 395,609 girls.
Speaking about challenges faced by the teams, he said that while parents were generally willing to vaccinate their daughters in local communities, difficulties arose in schools where parental consent was required.
He said the Rawalpindi Health Authority is urging all parents to support the HPV vaccination campaign for girls aged 9 to 14. “This vaccine is our best defense against cervical cancer, a disease that affects countless women,” he added.
He said the teams are working actively in schools and communities, but many girls remain unvaccinated, largely due to refusals based on misinformation.

“The delay in results in the beginning or middle semesters’ examinations is not that harmful for students as they continue with their studies by promoting to next semester in the university, but that of the final semester is damaging for graduated students,” several students and teachers of the university told
Dawn
.
They said that majority of the universities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Islamabad had either completed admission process to MPhil and MS degree classes or were in process but SBBW University so far had not declared results of BS programmes.
“Now we have to wait till next admission to be started in February or March,” one of the students told
Dawn
. She said that they had seen such delays in the declaration of results in previous semesters as well.
SBBWU spokesperson cites non-submission of theses by students as main reason
Students said that they were aware about the eminent delay in results, so they time and again requested the university’s examination section to plan well and announce their results on time, but in vain.
“Our final semester examination concluded in July while the university authorities said that results would be declared in October. How we will get admission in MPhil and MS at SBBWU which is scheduled to be started on September 28 while our results will be declared in October,” questioned a student.
Another student said that admission in MPhil and MS by the University of Peshawar and Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad had also completed.
A professor at University of Peshawar told
Dawn
that the process for admission in MPhil and MS had already completed and they were going to start classes in a couple of days.
Besides admission, the student said, she also missed a prestigious scholarship abroad.
One of the faculty members of the student said that relevant teachers of each discipline, who were also examiners, checked papers and submitted the results with the controller examination in proper time.
She said that the examination section of the university was either short of staff or it had no interest to prepare results in time to save the precious time of students.
“We have observed that some students reach sixth semester but they don’t receive results of their third semester,” said a faculty member of the university. She said that in that case, students didn’t waste time as they continued with the next semesters of the same discipline. However, delay in the results of final semester examinations was different as it prevented students from getting admissions and applying for scholarships and jobs as well.
When contacted for comments, the spokesperson of the university said that contrary to claims of delay, the results of eighth semester examinations were pending owing to delay in submission of theses by students and completion of evaluation processes.
She said that students submitted theses by August 31, but theses of some departments were still awaited. She said that finalisation of results required evaluation, viva and award lists by examiners. “We assure transparency and timely declaration of results once these due processes are completed,” she added.
The spokesperson said that students would be eligible for admission to MS/PhD in next (spring) session.
“Meanwhile, results of other semesters have been declared. The students, who wish to apply for scholarships, can obtain result slips for their passed semesters and proceed with their applications,” she said.

Speaking at the Quetta Press Club’s programme Meet the Press on Thursday, they said that in view of the serious water shortage, “we are going to announce a water emergency in Quetta”.
They said that steps were under way to resolve the water shortage and many plans were in the pipeline in this regard. However, they said that in order to resolve the water issue and improving cleanliness, joint efforts were needed as without public support, issues could not be resolved. They said the public awareness was very important and the masses must understand their responsibilities.
They said the government is committed to improving cleanliness and providing people with all facilities in the provincial capital through public-private partnerships and adopting modern technology. In this regard, they said an app is being developed to enhance public service delivery.

• Says every embankment is being monitored round the clock by trained staff
• Briefs Bilawal on measures to cope with ‘super flood’
KARACHI: Reiterating that his government is
fully prepared
to handle the
anticipated
‘super flood’ with inflows between 800,000 and 1.1 million cusecs, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah urged the federal government on Monday to formulate a comprehensive climate change policy.
The CM said this while addressing a
press conference
after reviewing the flood situation at the Provincial Flood Control Room at the New Sindh Secretariat.
Accompanied by Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon and Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, the chief minister said that his current priority was ensuring Sindh’s safety over the next 10 to 15 days. “But nationally, we must develop a comprehensive policy to tackle climate change,” he added.
He said the issue of climate change is an undeniable reality. “We must acknowledge that the impacts of climate change are extremely dangerous,” he stressed.
‘Up to 1.1m cusecs to reach Guddu Barrage by 5th’
The CM said that four days ago 1.077m cusecs of water had reached Qadirabad Barrage in Punjab. He explained that water from the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers converges at Panjnad before merging into the Indus at Kot Mithan.
“Currently, around 250,000 cusecs from Ravi, 350,000 cusecs from Sutlej and 200,000 cusecs from the Indus are combining with Chenab flows, and all this water eventually reach the sea through the Indus,” Mr Shah added.
He said that the National Disaster Management Authority had forecast 800,000 to 1.1m cusecs would reach Guddu Barrage by Sept 5. “Anything above 900,000 cusecs is declared a super flood,” he warned.
He said that the provincial government was fully prepared to handle water flows between 800,000 cusecs and 1.1m cusecs, as every precautionary measure in place to mitigate the impact of the anticipated “super flood”.
Mr Shah recalled that during the 2010 super flood, Guddu Barrage saw an inflow of 1.148m cusecs. “Recently, 550,000 cusecs passed through Guddu Barrage and today, we are prepared for up to 910,000 cusecs,” he said.
Preparations in place
Talking about flood preparations, Mr Shah said every quarter-mile of embankments now has a round-the-clock monitoring camp with 16 staff members trained to respond immediately.
“Sensitive points have been fortified with machinery and other arrangements,” he said, adding that special focus had also been placed on the KK Bund to ensure its protection.
He added that his government had secured the embankments. “After the 2010 floods, we raised them significantly, by around six feet,” he said.
“Our foremost responsibility is to protect human lives, livestock and our barrages,” he said.
He said that 192 rescue boats had been deployed and relief camps set up to accommodate those affected. “Authorities are closely monitoring the situation to respond swiftly to any emergencies,” he assured.
Bilawal briefed
Later, the CM called on PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and briefed him on the flood situation According to a PPP press release, the meeting was held at the Bilawal House, where senior leader Faryal Talpur was also present.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari directed the CM to take all necessary precautionary measures to assist people who may be affected by the floods and to further enhance the monitoring system for floodwaters and their impact.
He also emphasised that Sindh ministers, along with PPP office-bearers and workers, must stand shoulder to shoulder with the people during this difficult time.
The CM assured the party leadership that the provincial government was fully prepared to tackle the floods and effectively manage the situation that may follow in their aftermath.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942061/new-low-in-pak-afghan-ties,New low in Pak-Afghan ties - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"RELATIONS between Pakistan and Afghanistan have hit another low as frustration mounts in Islamabad with the Taliban’s lack of response to its
security concerns
. This despite stepped up diplomatic engagement by Pakistan this year to reset ties with Kabul after heightened tensions and a prolonged hiatus in high-level diplomatic exchanges in the previous year.
Two days ago, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly called on Kabul to
choose
between Pakistan and the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan). He said
cross-border attacks
from Afghanistan were unacceptable. This was the latest manifestation of renewed tensions.
Earlier, officials of the two countries had exchanged hot words. In late August, the Afghan foreign ministry accused Pakistan of launching air strikes on two of its eastern provinces, Nangarhar and Khost, calling this a “provocative act” that claimed the lives of several civilians. Afghan Defence Minister Mohammed Yaqoob said Pakistan was shifting blame for militant attacks on its soil to Afghanistan to hide weaknesses of its own security apparatus. Pakistan’s foreign ministry spokesman
dismissed
Yaqoob’s assertions, describing them as an effort to mask the seriousness of the situation.
Attacks in Pakistan by the TTP
rose
sharply after the Taliban returned to power four years ago. The Taliban takeover enabled the outlawed militant group to reorganise and escalate cross-border attacks, posing a serious threat to Pakistan’s security. Countless rounds of talks on the TTP between Pakistani officials and Taliban authorities yielded little. Pakistan repeatedly
urged
Kabul to disarm the TTP, detain its leaders and rein in its violent activities. Taliban leaders offered assurances and pledged to act, often asking for time. But they did nothing. Despite increasingly tough public warnings by Pakistan to Kabul, the Taliban took no meaningful action.
Heightened militant activity from across the border, a spike in terrorist attacks and rising casualties among security personnel then compelled Pakistan to
launch
kinetic strikes targeting TTP figures and hideouts in Afghanistan.
In April 2024, in a departure from the past, Islamabad publicly acknowledged Pakistan had carried out air strikes against militant sanctuaries in Afghanistan. This met with a toughly worded response from Kabul and rise in border tensions. Islamabad, however, warned such actions would continue unless the Taliban changed course. In December 2024, Pakistani fighter jets
carried out
unannounced air strikes against TTP hideouts at four locations in Paktika province. This followed an audacious TTP attack on a border post in Makin which left 16 security personnel dead. This forced Pakistan to retaliate.
Taliban’s lack of response to Pakistan’s security concerns is a source of mounting frustration for Islamabad.
At the same time, Pakistan tightened
restrictions
on transit trade, which involved a ban on many items that could be imported by Afghanistan via Pakistan, as well as imposed limits on bilateral trade. This was aimed at raising the costs for the Taliban for their non-compliance with Islamabad’s TTP demands. Pakistan also began
expelling
undocumented Afghans residing in Pakistan and deporting those holding Afghan citizen cards that were issued by Pakistani authorities a few years ago. Around 1.2 million Afghan refugees have been repatriated so far in what many see as an accelerated process.
This year, however, Pakistan switched course from this purely coercive approach to a carrot-and-stick policy. It hoped that resumption of diplomatic engagement with several confidence-building trips to Kabul by Special Representative Mohammed Sadiq and a visit by the Afghan Commerce Minister Nooruddin Azizi to Islamabad in April would encourage Taliban leaders to respond to its TTP concerns.
The high point of the revived diplomatic engagement was the
visit
of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to Kabul in late April 2025. Much progress was made during that visit on bilateral and transit trade issues, including the Preferential Trade Agreement and the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement, with the Pakistani side acceding to many Taliban requests in this regard. The Taliban promised to take steps to effectively ‘contain’ the TTP. But these again turned out to be empty promises.
Pakistan nonetheless continued with its diplomatic strategy of engaging the Taliban authorities. It invited Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Mutaqqi for talks to Islamabad and made preparations for his visit just ahead of the
trilateral meeting
in August between Pakistan, China and Afghanistan in Kabul. Muttaqi’s visit did not take place because of the UN travel ban on him. Pakistan had sought but was unable to get a waiver from the Security Council’s sanctions committee to allow him to travel. In July, Dar
visited
Kabul to sign a framework agreement between Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan for the feasibility of a railway project aimed at promoting regional connectivity,
Dar went again to Kabul for the trilateral meeting — his third visit in five months. Despite positive public statements issued by all sides, the meeting proved to be inconclusive on the most important issue on its agenda: security. Both the Pakistani and Chinese delegations were disappointed by the outcome. No joint statement was issued because the Taliban refused to name TTP and ETIM (East Turkestan Islamic Movement) in it. This was in contrast to the previous trilateral held in Pakistan in 2023, when these terrorist organisations were named in the joint declaration that was issued. This suggested that the Taliban, far from committing to take concrete steps against these militant organisations, were backtracking.
While Pakistan’s frustration with the Taliban is probably at a record high in the face of continuing cross-border terror attacks from Afghanistan there is no suggestion of any disengagement by Islamabad with Kabul. This could risk a breakdown in relations which does not serve Pakistan’s interests. It will also not persuade the Taliban to change course given what happened the last time this approach was tried.
This leaves Pakistan with a policy dilemma. It has already conveyed to Kabul that cross-border attacks that produce heavy casualties will invite a kinetic Pakistani response. It is possible that ‘hot pursuit’ by Pakistan might involve air strikes deeper into Afghan territory; so far, they have been limited to border areas. The complex relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan will continue to face challenges even as Islamabad mulls over what else it can do beyond the carrot-and-stick policy it is following.

Swabi Deputy Superintendent of Police Ijaz Khan Abazai told
Dawn.com
: “The number of arrested individuals was 226, and a number of them belonged to various areas outside the district, and the larger issue was that they tore the uniforms of three police personnel when they were resisting the police order to close the show.”
He added that the arrested included two members of the transgender community as well.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at the Swabi City Police Station on the complaint of Station House Officer (SHO) Saidul Amin under Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions), 294 (obscene acts in public) and 506 (criminal intimidation of the Pakistan Penal Code and other legal sections.
It read that a musical show was underway in Raz Muhammad market in the district headquarters, and the police sought to find out what was happening when they were alerted about the matter.
“The music event was playing ‘immoral’ songs at high volume through loudspeakers, and obscene and ‘immoral’ dancing in ‘half-naked’ clothes continued, and when they were told to stop the show, they resisted the order with full vigour,” the FIR added.
It added that some of the audience members were carrying pistols and they resorted to aerial firing during the event. The FIR also stated that some audience members were also making videos and sharing them on social media.
SHO Amin said that personnel from the Zaida and Tehsil Topi police stations, along with other police posts, were called and a raid was conducted.
Senior police officials had said on Sunday that Swabi police arrested a TikToker who was allegedly making videos while dressing as a girl and uploading them to his account to “mislead people, especially the youth“.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942752/lawyers-to-go-on-strike-in-peshawar-today,Lawyers to go on strike in Peshawar today - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"PESHAWAR: The ‘persistent and blanket’ disruption of mobile phone network signals on the premises of Peshawar High Court, Judicial Complex and other adjacent courts allegedly due to installation of jammers in the nearby central prison has compelled legal fraternity to observe strike in Peshawar from today (Thursday) for an indefinite period.
Peshawar Bar Association (PBA) made the announcement after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council accepted its request and allowed it to go ahead with the strike in local courts.
The association, which has been demanding for the last couple of weeks of government and local administration to resolve the matter, announced that lawyers won’t appear in proceedings before any of the courts in district judiciary.
A statement was jointly issued by PBA office-bearers including its president Qaiser Zaman, general secretary Zahidullah Zahid and press secretary Imran Khan Yousafzai, stating that they won’t call off the strike unless the issue was resolved and the disruption of mobile phone signals ended.
PBA also announced that it would file a petition in high court to challenge the suspension of phone signals due to the jammers installed in the nearby prison.
Earlier, in the day lawyers staged a protest against the issue and also locked one of the prison gates opening into Judicial Complex.
The president of PHC Bar Association, Aminur Rehman Yousafzai, its vice president Arshid Nowshervi, Qaiser Zaman, Zahidullah Zahid and other lawyers’ representatives told journalists that for the last three months they had been struggling to get the issue resolved, but in vain.
Meanwhile, KP Bar Council has also expressed concerns over the issue and demanded of government and prison authorities to resolve it at the earliest.
KPBC vice-chairman Ahmad Farooq Khattak and its executive committee chairman Akbar Khan Kohistani stated that prison authorities had created problems for people outside by installing the jammers.
It is pertinent to mention that PHC had sought the response of Pakistan Telecommunication Authority in July this year to a petition challenging mobile phone disruptions in courts.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944055/parliament-urged-to-add-right-to-appeal-in-military-trials,Parliament urged to add right to appeal in military trials - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"• Justice Aminuddin Khan issues detailed reasoning, says Oct 23 order by five judges more akin to ‘legislation than interpretation’
• Civilians’ trials in military courts ‘long understood as valid and operative’, says Justice Mazhar
ISLAMABAD: Justice Aminuddin Khan has said that though the procedural framework under the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 includes due process protections, the absence of an independent right of appeal to a civilian court has rendered its application to civilians constitutionally incomplete.
He made these remarks in a 68-page judgement to justify the May 7 short order on a set of 38 intra-court appeals, which challenged the Oct 23, 2023,
order
on military trials of the civilians. Justice Khan explained that this deficiency required legislative intervention, urging parliament to do the needful in 45 days.
According to Justice Khan, the Constitutional Bench had referred the matter to parliament for the enactment of appropriate amendments, with the expectation that such institutional deference would be accorded due respect. He, however, again sought necessary amendments or suitable legislation within a period of 45 days to provide right of appeal in the high courts against convictions rendered by court martial or military courts under sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of clause (d) of subsection (1) of section 2, read with subsection (4) of Section 59.
Justice Khan observed that a fair trial demanded that the forum should be fair, impartial, and governed by transparent rules. The PAA, as currently framed and applied in the present context, meets this constitutional requirement, Justice Khan said, adding it was held that the conduct of trials under PAA, where exercised within the statutory limits and supported by procedural safeguards, did not violate fair trial standards.
On May 7, a seven-judge Constitutional Bench restored by a majority of 5-2 key provisions of the
Pakistan Army Act
under which civilians were convicted for their involvement in the May 9, 2023, arson
attacks
on military installations. The short order had also set aside the Oct 23 judgement, restoring Section 2(1)(d)(i) and (ii) and Section 59 (4) of the PAA. These provisions were struck down by a majority of four to one by a five-judge bench in October 2023.
‘Reading down’ approach
The interpretive technique of reading down, as employed in the Oct 23 judgement, was inapposite, Justice Khan said, adding that the doctrine of reading down was a tool of judicial restraint designed to preserve the constitutionality of statutes by construing them narrowly in case of ambiguity. It cannot be deployed to insert qualifications or restrictions into clear constitutional provisions, he observed.
The Oct 23 order purported to use reading down to override the unambiguous text of Article 8(3)(a), effectively substituting judicial preference for constitutional command, Justice Khan emphasised, adding this approach crossed the threshold of legitimate interpretation and entered the domain of constitutional amendment. The judicial function is to interpret, not to legislate, he stressed.
Article 8(3)(a) is a self-contained constitutional provision. It categorically exempts laws enacted for the Armed Forces, for purposes of discipline and discharge of duties, from the operation of fundamental rights, Justice Khan said, calling it a deliberate legislative choice by the framers.
The introduction of Article 8(5) as a qualifying provision in this context is doctrinally and textually unsound. Article 8(5) deals with the suspension of rights under emergency powers and does not, and cannot, override the permanent structural exclusion under Article 8(3)(a), he added.
Article 8(3)(a) exempts laws relating to the armed forces from the purview of fundamental rights, explicitly recognising a parallel regime for military discipline.
Article 245 further empowers the armed forces to act in defence of Pakistan and in aid of civil authority, indicating that the Constitution contemplates a domain of operations and discipline governed by military command and distinct legal processes, Justice Khan said
Justice Khan said the adjudicatory authority exercised by military courts over civilians does not infringe the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Article 175(3) is not offended by the existence or operation of military courts within their legal remit.
Additional note
Meanwhile, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, though concurring, said in his additional note that the trial of civilians only for specific offences as provided under Section 2 (d) (i) and (ii) was not a new phenomenon.
It is a ground reality that the provisions of PAA extending jurisdiction to certain civilians have stood connected appeals for several decades, receiving the tacit approval of successive legislatures and the silent acquiescence of the Supreme Court.
The fact that these provisions remained unchallenged or were not declared ultra vires at an earlier stage suggests that they were long understood as valid and operative within the constitutional scheme, Justice Mazhar explained.
It was only in the aftermath of the events of May 9, 2023, when prosecutions of civilians under PAA acquired public and political prominence that this question was brought into sharp focus. Against this backdrop, it is necessary to ask whether it is the law itself that is infirm, or whether the sudden urgency of the present moment has led to a judicial reappraisal that stands at odds with decades of settled acceptance, he argued.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945114/three-more-testify-in-ghq-protest-case-against-imran-despite-defence-objection,Three more testify in GHQ protest case against Imran despite defence objection - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"RAWALPINDI: Despite an objection from defence lawyers, an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) of Rawalpindi on Saturday recorded the testimony of three more prosecution witnesses in a
case
against former prime minister Imran Khan related to violent protests outside the army headquarters, GHQ, on May 9, 2023.
The court proceeded with the hearing irrespective of objections from Mr Khan’s legal team, who requested a halt to the video link trial, insisting on his in-person appearance.
ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah resumed proceedings in the General Headquarters (GHQ) protest case as lawyers for Mr Khan submitted an application seeking his personal appearance. They urged the court to stop the trial being conducted via video link, where Mr Khan appears from Adiala Jail.
Raja Ikram Ameen Minhas, head of the prosecution, argued that a similar application had already been dismissed and the defence counsel did not challenge that order before the Lahore High Court. He alleged the defence filed the previously decided application to disrupt the court proceeding.
Judge overrules plea for ex-premier to appear in person; says he can’t stop the trial without an appellate forum’s restraining order
The judge observed that he could not stop the trial unless an appellate forum restrained him from doing so.
The court then recorded statements from three prosecution witnesses: Tehzeebul Hassan, Asmat Kamal and Akbar. The testimony of 44 of the 50 prosecution witnesses has now been recorded. The court summoned three more witnesses for a hearing on Sept 30.
The legal arguments on Saturday reflect an ongoing dispute over the trial’s format.
On Sept 19, Judge Shah had ruled that the trial would be held on court premises instead of at Adiala Jail but said Mr Khan’s attendance would be marked through a video link, an order passed after a Punjab government notification cited security concerns.
Mr Khan, who has been
incarcerated
since Aug 2023, faces multiple cases. He was indicted in December last year in the GHQ protest case and was formally
arrested
by Rawalpindi police in connection with it in January 2024.
His initial arrest from the Islam­abad High Court on May 9, 2023, triggered
violent protests
across the country, during which state buildings and military installations were vandalised.
During Tuesday’s hearing, defence lawyers again sought a deferment to challenge the video link order, but the prosecution, however, argued that the defence neither obtained any restraining order from the high court nor challenged the order before an appellate forum.
The judge then proceeded with the testimony of prosecution witnesses as the defence counsel left the courtroom and later told reporters about connectivity issues in the video link arrangement.
The prosecution has said it expects to conclude its evidence against Khan and other leaders of his Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party next week, after which cross-examination of the witnesses is expected to begin.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939553,IHC adopts new rules by razor-thin majority - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"• CJ turns down plea by some judges to postpone meeting as they haven’t had a chance to review the voluminous document
• Move to have family courts hear polygamy cases gets full court nod
ISLAMABAD: Despite strong resistance from senior judges, a full court meeting of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday adopted the
High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2025
.
The rules were passed by a slim majority, while a proposal from two  judges, seeking changes to the meeting’s agenda, was rejected.
According to the agenda, the full court had been convened to deliberate on three key issues: amendments to the law related to polygamy, structural flaws in the IHC building, and the adoption of the service rules.
The meeting was attended by all 11 judges, including Chief Justice Sardar Moham­mad Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Jus­tice Tariq Mehmood Jahan­giri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ish­aq Khan, Justice Khadim Hus­sain Soomro, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, Justice Moham­mad Azam Khan, Jus­t­ice Moham­mad Asif, and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas.
Polygamy law, building flaws
Sources said the full court unanimously approved the amendment to the polygamy law, under which such cases will now be tried by family courts instead of executive magistrates.
It also decided to refer the IHC building case to the federal government for a thorough investigation into persistent issues. An inquiry conducted by the public works department earlier pointed out several defects in the elevators.
The inquiry report noted that the elevators lacked certain features promised in the prototype and the specifications, but it failed to identify those responsible for the fau­lty installation and maintenance.
Apart from the elevators, the IHC building continues to suffer from multiple problems, including an ineffective cooling system and inadequate parking facilities for litigants and lawyers.
The judges observed that instead of referring the matter directly to the National Accountability Bureau or the Federal Investigation Agency, the federal government should be asked to carry out a comprehensive probe and take corrective measures.
CJ’s powers
Unlike these two agenda items, the proposed IHC Rules, 2025 triggered  a sharp division among the judges. While the chief justice strongly supported them, senior judges, including Justice Kayani, Justice  Jahangiri, Justice Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz, and Justice Imtiaz, opposed their adoption and urged amendments.
A day before the meeting, Justice Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had
written letters
to their colleagues, voicing serious concerns that administrative powers were being misused to sideline dissenting judges.
Both judges strongly objected to a new circular requiring judges to obtain a No-Objection Cert­ificate (NOC) from the chief justice for foreign travel.
They alleged that case assignments were being manipulated to benefit judges transferred to the IHC alongside the chief justice, while permanent judges who had opposed his transfer were being sidelined.
The letters also challenged the chief justice’s use of the “master of the roster” power to transfer part-heard cases.
Justice Khan also took exception to the new Practice and Procedure Rules (PPR), reminding his colleagues that PPR had already been gazetted without approval or even proper discussion by the full bench.
He noted the voluminous document, spanning more than 600 pages, had been provided only a day and a half before the meeting, reducing consultation to a mere formality and making meaningful input impossible.
Justice Khan dem­anded that five additional agenda items, including these objections, be formally taken up for “proper deliberations” in the full court meeting, signalling his refusal to let the controversy be ignored.
Voting and objections
According to sources, Chief Justice Dogar rejected any alteration in the agenda and proceeded to call a vote.
Six judges, including the chief justice, approved the rules, while five opposed them and resolved to record their objections in writing.
During the proceedings, the dissenting judges questioned whether those voting in favour had even read the new rules. The response, sources claimed, was negative.
Some judges, noting the massive length of the document, requested the chief justice to postpone the meeting, but their plea was turned down. Ultimately, the High Court Establishment (Appointment and Con­ditions of Service) Rules, 2025 were adopted by a razor-thin majority, leaving the full court deeply divided.

Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Muhammad Yousuf Malik found Muhammad Sajid guilty of the offence and sentenced him to 14 years in prison for throwing acid on his wife, Saima Bibi, who had suffered 22 per cent burn injuries, and an additional 10 years for trying to kill her.
“It has been established that the accused committed offence of throwing acid upon an innocent lady without any justification,” the court remarked.
According to state prosecutor Ayesha Saeed, the couple had been married for 12 years, but the woman had been living with her parents along with her three children for the past two-and-a-half years as her husband, who was a drug addict, used to beat her.
In her testimony before the court, the acid attack survivor stated that on the day of the incident, she was at her parents’ house when, at around 8pm, her husband arrived, suddenly threw acid on her and fled.
Subsequently, her brother and mother shifted her to a hospital, where she recorded her statement and nominated her husband for the offence.
During the trial, the defence counsel contended that the accused was falsely implicated in the case. Claiming that the brother of the woman had thrown acid, he also argued that the prosecution failed to produce independent witnesses in the case.
But the court rejected the defence plea and noted that the accused failed to produce substantial evidence in support of his claim.
It added that the incident had taken place inside the house; therefore, the family members who were present and saw the incident came forward and recorded their statements in support of the victim.
A case was registered at the Defence police station under Section 324 (attempted murder) and 336-B (punishment for hurt by corrosive substance) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943308/call-to-restore-natural-waterways-to-prevent-urban-flooding-in-karachi,Call to restore natural waterways to prevent urban flooding in Karachi - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"• Many housing societies, Malir Expressway built on path of water channels termed ‘environmentally unfriendly’
• Moot demands protection of Karachi villages, remaining agriculture field
KARACHI: Climate change experts and members of civil society on Friday called for the immediate restoration and clearing of the city’s natural waterways and warned that continued neglect in this matter could lead to more frequent and severe
urban flooding
in the city, as seen during recent
rains
.
This was the gist of a session titled ‘Obstacles to Karachi’s Natural Waterways and Potential Threats’ held at the Karachi Press Club.
The speakers also highlighted that housing societies built on natural waterways like Saadi Town and Saadi Garden, along with projects near the Malir Expressway, also known as Shahrah-i-Bhutto, are environmentally unfriendly.
They also pointed out that hill torrents from the Kirthar range swelled the Lyari and Malir rivers, and stressed the need to remove all blockages and encroachments in these areas to ensure a smooth water flow.
Speaking on the occasion, urban planner Muhammad Toheed said that climate change is now an undeniable reality, and while countries around the world have upgraded their drainage and infrastructure systems in response, Karachi continues to lag far behind.
“Environmental and climate-related issues are nowhere on our list of priorities,” he said, adding that despite Pakistan being among the
most vulnerable
countries to climate change, the issue is still not treated with the urgency it deserves.
He pointed out that Karachi suffers from a lack of proper planning and coordination among civic bodies. There is no significant progress in road engineering or drainage infrastructure. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation must also be held accountable, he said and highlighted that contractors often build roads without engineering supervision, which results in poorly designed surfaces that cause water accumulation and the formation of low-lying flood-prone areas.
Mr Toheed further criticised the discharge of sewage into stormwater drains by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation.
“This is a disaster. Now we can’t even tell the difference between a sewerage line and a storm water drain,” he said. “The city’s sewerage system has collapsed, with sewage stagnating in several areas even in the absence of rainfall.”
He stressed the urgent need to restore and separate the city’s drainage and sewerage infrastructure to prevent further deterioration.
‘Poor urban planning destroys Malir’s agricultural land’
Agriculturist Azeem Dehqan said that Karachiites should learn about the city’s history, adding that saving the metropolis from its ongoing crises is a moral responsibility shared by all citizens.
He pointed out that Malir and its surrounding areas were once fertile agricultural lands where crops, fruits and vegetables were widely grown, but this productivity has declined significantly over the years due to poor urban planning and the rise of housing societies and
development projects
that are not environmentally friendly.
Similarly, author Ramzan Baloch said that Malir once had clean drinking water and was known for producing high-quality crops, but over the years, the area has suffered severe degradation of its natural resources.
He also lamented that the people have no interest in environmental issues, which is one of the main reasons for the lack of practical action on climate-related challenges in Pakistan.
Mr Baloch also blamed those in power for the city’s current crises and said that it is the responsibility of the rulers to address these problems, but they have failed to take meaningful action.
Social activist Bashir Baloch said large volumes of rainwater flow from the Kirthar range into the Lyari and Malir rivers. Therefore, authorities need to remove all blockages and encroachments in these areas to ensure proper water flow and prevent future disasters.
He cited a historical example and pointed out that the British had once constructed a railway bridge over the Malir River, which was later washed away by heavy rains due to the large volume of water flowing through the river. Something similar had happened during the current rains, he added.
He also criticised the mayor and claimed that he lacked a proper understanding of the city’s geography and its natural water channels, as evident from his recent media briefings.
Climate activist Yasir Darya said that due to climate change, weather patterns have become increasingly unpredictable, which has disrupted the natural cycle of seasons. He added that even weather experts are now struggling to accurately forecast conditions beyond a few days. In such a situation, he stressed, better urban planning is urgently needed in Karachi to prepare for and adapt to these changes.
Resolution
A resolution presented during the session called for the restoration and clearing of Karachi’s natural waterways and sewerage system.
It also demanded the protection of remaining agricultural land, the formulation of relevant laws and the treatment of sewage for agricultural use.
The resolution further emphasised the need to protect the villages within Karachi’s limits.
Lawyers Abeera Ashfaque, Kazim Mahesar and others also spoke on the occasion.

Speaking at a press conference here at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office, the minister said misleading propaganda had been spread against the vaccine and that he wanted to prove with action, not words that it was safe.
“I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career,” he told journalists. “But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”
Mr Kamal said that just as he cared for his own daughter, he considered the daughters of the nation equally precious. “Our purpose is to seek Allah’s approval by protecting our people from disease,” he added.
The minister stressed that Pakistan’s healthcare system could not provide treatment to every citizen and that many patients remained in hospitals for extended periods. He called for greater emphasis on vaccination as a prevention.
The health minister also said that more vaccines would be introduced in the future and urged the public to adopt them to shield the nation from life-threatening illnesses.
“Cancer is a deadly disease that affects not just an individual but entire families and prevention remains the best path forward,” he concluded.
It might be recalled that the federal government, as well as governments of Punjab and Sindh, had launched the first-ever vaccination
campaign
against cervical cancer on Sept 15. The campaign targeting millions of girls aged nine to 14 will run till Sept 27.
According to officials, the Sindh health department is facing multiple challenges in meeting the target, including vaccine hesitancy in parts of Karachi, which they blame on the constant spread of misleading information through social media.
However, the department claims to have achieved 60 per cent coverage, providing vaccination to over
550,000 girls
across the province in four days since the campaign’s launch.
Pakistan is the 149th country to introduce this vaccine into its immunisation schedule. It’s already being used in Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Indonesia.

much-delayed
Red Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project must be carried out continuously.
It was also proposed during the proceedings that the provincial government should constitute a committee, to be headed by Senior Sindh Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, to address issues and expedite the work on the project.
A two-judge bench of SHC comprising Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Justice Mohammad Abdur Rahman said that after its constitution, the proposed committee must take all stakeholders on board in order to resolve issues and expedite the work.
Citing the secretary of transport department, Sindh Mass Transit Authority, Asian Development Bank, TransKarachi, the implementation agency for project, and others as respondents, a petition was filed last month against inordinate delay in completion of the BRT project.
Bench proposes committee to address issues stalling work
At the last hearing, the bench had put the respondents on notice and also sought a timeframe for completion of the project.
At the outset of the hearing, the bench heard the parties on preliminary objections raised by the respondents over the maintainability of the petition.
However, it has been proposed during the hearing that the provincial government will from a committee for mediation among the parties and to resolve the disputes so that the work must be expedited.
The bench in its order said, “We are, therefore, adjourning this matter, to be taken up after three weeks and are hopeful that meanwhile such committee would be constituted and meeting would have taken place under the chairmanship of Mr Sharjeel Inam Memon, the senior minister, in which all the stakeholders would be called, including the respondents, and efforts would be made to resolve the disputes so that the work shall continuously be carried out”, it added.
It also directed a provincial law officer to file a report about the meeting of the proposed committee on Oct 2.
Petitioner Asif Iqbal through his lawyer Omer Memon approached the SHC and submitted that being a resident of the area, the petitioner has been aggrieved for last eight years as he has had to endure the negligence of respondents.
He also asserted that the project, designed to cover around 27 kilometres from Malir Halt to Numaish via University Road, was announced in 2017 with an initial cost of around Rs79 billion, but due to persistent delays and mismanagement the estimated cost has now escalated to Rs103 billion.
After commencement of the work in early 2022, the project was initially scheduled for completion by 2023, which was later pushed to 2024 and has subsequently been extended to the end of 2026, he maintained.
The petitioner further contended that even the revised timeline appeared to be wholly unrealistic as the project continued to progress at a snail’s pace and various factors had been cited by officials to justify these delays, including disputes with contractors, safety stoppages, rising construction costs due to depreciation of the rupee, difficulties in land acquisition, relocation of utilities and coordination failures between implementing agencies.

The remarks were made during a press conference, where leaders of the political alliance criticised the government’s response to a natural disaster affecting numerous districts.
“Punjab is also facing severe floods, but the provincial government has completely failed,” said TTAP Secretary General Asad Qaiser, who was joined by Salman Akram Raja, Raja Nasir Abbas and others.
“Instructions have been passed that relief activities cannot be done without pictures of Maryam Nawaz. Only media campaign is going on and no relief has been provided.”

Mr Qaiser, stating that he also belongs to a flood-affected area, spoke of the human toll of the disaster. “I also belong to areas affected by flood and know a house in which 13 family members died,” he said.
He called for a comprehensive plan to build small dams and suggested that an emergency be declared. Mr Qaiser also blamed illegal housing societies for flooding in Lahore and urged the government to re-launch the Billion Tree Tsunami project to prevent disasters in future.
He contrasted the current situation with the 2022 floods, claiming the former PDM government sought international funds but failed to act. He also alleged the current Punjab government was preoccupied with social media.
“Punjab government was busy on TikTok and was doing nothing,” Mr Qaiser said, noting that livestock was suffering without care while officials were making visits to Japan instead of supporting the people.
Salman Akram Raja, who also spoke at the conference, warned of economic consequences. He said destroyed crops would lead to higher prices for rice and wheat.
“The import-export gap has been increasing due to which inflation will increase,” Mr Raja said.

According to the office of Vehari District Police Officer Muhammad Afzal, constables Waqas Yaseen, Rizwan and Umar Daraz, impersonated as CCD officials and kidnapped Salman Khan, a wholesale supplier of a tea brand in the area, on Sept 23 in their car in which they also consumed ice and heroin.
They kept him in illegal custody in the car and drove on various roads for over four hours as they demanded Rs0.5m from him.
They threatened him that if he did not pay the amount, he would be killed in an encounter.
The complainant paid the suspects Rs74,000 cash in presence of his witnesses while they snatched another Rs9,000 from his pocket and released from near Tableeghi Markaz, Burewala.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945109/asia-pacific-leads-recovery-in-global-tourism-says-un-body,"Asia-Pacific leads recovery in global tourism, says UN body - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","ISLAMABAD: World Tourism Day was obse­r­ved on Saturday with a focus on tourism’s potential as an agent of positive change, as UN Tourism (formerly UNWTO) repo­rted strong visitor numbers across Asia-Pacific destinations.
The theme for this year — “Tourism and Sus­tainable Transformation” — underscored that lasting change must begin with effective governance and people-centred planning.
The UN body warned that despite tourism’s potential, nearly half of young people in emerging destinations lack the training to participate effectively, and urged governments to prioritise accessible, high-quality education and vocational programmes.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in his message, said tourism is not only an industry for Pakistan, but an expression of its national identity and pride. He called for tourism to be developed as an engine of growth to create jobs for young people.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in his message that tourism strengthens bonds between people and places. “It builds bridges across cultures, preserves traditions and restores cultural heritage. It reminds us of our shared humanity — and the richness of diversity,” he said.
Set to launch Tourism Law Observatory in Middle East
“Yet tourism can also damage the very places and communities it celebrates. As the world faces climate breakdown and rising inequalities, we need bold, urgent, and sustainable action that puts people and planet first,” he said.
UN Tourism said that following a period of rapid growth, Asia and the Pacific suffered the deepest impact on its tourism industry due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, in 2025, the region’s recovery for international tourism arrivals is catching up with the rest of the world due to relaxed visa policies and improved air connectivity.
Pakistan has already introduced a substantial change to its visa regime, and tourists from 126 countries can now obtain a visa prior to arrival, valid for 90 days, with no cost. This visa reform aims to promote foreign tourism and increase accessibility to the scenic beauty of Pakistan.
According to the ‘World Tourism Barometer’, Asia and the Pacific exceeded the world average in the first half of 2025, with an 11 per cent increase in international tourist arrivals over the same period in 2024, though still 8pc below 2019 levels.
North-East Asia led the recovery in the region with 20pc tourism growth in January-June 2025 (compared with 2024), hinting at the important influence of China as the world’s largest tourism source market.
In the meantime, UN Tourism is set to establish a Tourism Law Observatory for the Middle East. This pioneering initiative will support the development and harmonisation of legal and regulatory frameworks for tourism across the region.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939974,COMMENT: WHY THE INDUS WATERS TREATY MATTERS GLOBALLY - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"Picture this: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, New Zealand, Pakistan, India and the World Bank sitting around the same table with a shared mission — creating one of the world’s most successful examples of international cooperation.
This isn’t diplomatic wishful thinking; it’s exactly what happened in the 1950s when these nations came together to forge the
Indus Waters Treaty
(IWT).
While headlines today focus on border skirmishes and political discord between India and Pakistan, this remarkable partnership of countries quietly built something extraordinary: a regional public good that has fed 300 million people, powered two economies, and survived the Cold War and border skirmishes for over 60 years.
THE STAKES — THEN AND NOW
When Pakistan gained independence in 1947, potential water wars in the Subcontinent posed a global threat. Rather than leaving it to chance, the international community acted decisively.
Each country brought different strengths — financial resources, technical expertise, diplomatic capital and local knowledge — to build infrastructure and institutions that have lasted over six decades.
Today, both India and Pakistan stand at critical economic junctures. India races to realise its potential as a global economic powerhouse. Pakistan struggles with economic stability amid mounting climate threats, economic instability and regional tensions that have begun eroding half a century of development gains.
Forged by an unlikely alliance of world powers, the treaty is a stunning example of international cooperation that has survived wars and nuclear stand-offs. Now, it faces a new enemy in political collapse and climate change…
For India, continued cooperation isn’t diplomatic nicety. It is an economic necessity. The country’s ambitious manufacturing and technology sectors depend on stable agricultural supply chains and regional trade routes.
Water conflicts
would disrupt these foundations just as India seeks larger shares of global markets.
Pakistan faces starker realities. Climate change has intensified
flooding
and
drought cycles
, making predictable water flows guaranteed by the treaty literally lifesaving. The country’s economic recovery plans depend heavily on agricultural exports and energy generation, both impossible without the water security the IWT provides.
Regional trade
between these nuclear neighbours remains far below potential, partly due to political tensions. This precarious situation is exactly what the treaty’s architects sought to prevent, building a system so robust it has defied the odds for over six decades.
WHY THE TREATY WORKS
The IWT represents something unique in international relations: a genuine multilateral success story, where developed and developing nations pooled resources to create lasting regional prosperity. What economists call a “regional public good” — a resource that benefits everyone in a region regardless of contribution — was deliberately constructed through unprecedented international cooperation.
The scale of commitment was extraordinary. The founding partners, working through the World Bank (WB), invested what amounts to $8 billion in today’s money. This wasn’t charity. It was strategic investment in regional stability and economic development that has paid dividends for decades.
The treaty succeeded because it aligned individual national interests with collective regional benefits. Every participating country gained something valuable: India and Pakistan secured predictable water access, contributing nations advanced regional stability objectives, and the WB established a template for successful development cooperation.
The numbers demonstrate the treaty’s economic impact. The Indus basin supports the world’s largest contiguous irrigation system, feeding millions directly. The Green Revolution that transformed South Asia from food-deficit to food-surplus was built on the foundation of reliable water-sharing provided by the treaty.  Rice paddies in Punjab, wheat fields in Sindh, and cotton farms across the basin all depend on this cooperative framework.
This ingenious treaty not only serves as an economic engine, but also functions as a bulwark against a shared and devastating failure.
THE COST OF FAILURE
Without this framework, agricultural collapse would trigger food insecurity across South Asia and beyond. The treaty prevents what economists call “tragedy of the commons” — destructive competition over shared resources that leaves everyone worse off.
Beyond immediate economic benefits, the Indus Basin represents something more profound: a piece of humanity’s shared heritage that transcends national boundaries. The Indus Valley was home to humanity’s earliest civilisations, where agriculture, cities and trade first flourished 5,000 years ago. The river system that sustained those ancient societies continues to support one of the world’s most densely populated regions today.
The scientific community increasingly recognise major river systems, such as the Indus, as global commons — ecosystems whose health affects the entire planet — joining other critical systems such as the Amazon Rainforest, the Congo Basin, the Great Barrier Reef and Antarctica, which are viewed as a common heritage of humankind. The Indus basin’s glacial systems help regulate regional climate patterns. Its wetlands provide crucial biodiversity habitat. Its agricultural output contributes to global food security.
The treaty’s importance will only grow as climate change intensifies. The Himalayas, source of the Indus system, are warming faster than the global average. Glacial melt patterns are shifting.
Monsoon cycles
are becoming less predictable.
Extreme weather events
are increasing in frequency and intensity.
These changes don’t respect national borders. India and Pakistan must adapt together or fail separately. The treaty’s existing framework for data sharing, joint technical committees and dispute resolution provides institutional foundation needed for emergent issues. Article VII of the treaty provides the legal foundation for “future cooperation” and “optimum development” of the rivers, yet it has remained largely unutilised.
Forward-looking economists argue that disaster-resilient infrastructure and cooperative resource management will be key competitive advantages in the coming decades. Countries that maintain stable agricultural production, reliable water supplies and peaceful regional relationships will attract investment and trade partnerships.
The model that averted failure — and managed complex pressures — now serves as a blueprint for the world.
THE GLOBAL BLUEPRINT
The WB’s role demonstrates how international institutions can facilitate regional public goods, while maintaining neutrality. Despite governance structures that give major donors significant voting power, the WB keeps treaty functions strictly neutral and technical. This preserves credibility as an honest broker, while ensuring stakeholders maintain oversight.
The Bank served as both architect and guarantor of the IWT, channelling international contributions while maintaining operational independence necessary for neutral facilitation. This governance model — combining board oversight with institutional neutrality — has proven remarkably durable, surviving multiple wars, political crises and leadership changes in all participating countries.
This model has global implications. From the Mekong River in Southeast Asia to the Nile in Africa, transboundary water systems worldwide face similar pressures. The IWT offers a template for how international coalitions can facilitate regional public goods that benefit entire regions while respecting national sovereignty.
THE PATH FORWARD
The IWT stands as proof that international partnerships can create enduring regional public goods when they commit sufficient resources and design proper institutions. The choice facing the original coalition partners isn’t about water allocation — it’s about preserving a mechanism that has served global stability for over six decades.
The smart economic choice, the environmentally responsible choice and the globally minded choice all point toward protecting this remarkable achievement. In a world seeking models for successful multilateral cooperation, this eight-nation vision offers a blueprint for the kind of collective action that will define prosperity and stability in the 21st century.
However, the original leadership now faces a critical choice. Their investments in regional stability, their stake in South Asian prosperity, and their share in global trade and resilience all depend on preserving this cooperative framework. As nuclear tensions rise and climate pressures mount, these eight partners must actively intervene to protect not just a treaty, but their own strategic interests in regional peace, economic stability, and the multilateral cooperation model they pioneered.
The IWT isn’t just South Asia’s treasure — it’s proof of what the international community can achieve when it commits to building something bigger than itself.

But here, surviving is a constant struggle,” lamented Abrar, 62, seated outside his house in Tent City, Hawkesbay.
His house and that of other flood victims are made of fabric, bamboo and other scraps that the migrants have assembled to create a semblance of shelter. The Tent City was established as part of the state’s response to manage and relocate displaced people across Karachi after catastrophic floods hit Sindh, first in 2010 and then in 2022, when 33 million people lost their homes to the deluge that submerged one-third of the country.
Internal displacement
has today become a predominant form of forced migration across the globe. Internally displaced people are particularly vulnerable, and this is contingent on the complex linkages between migration and gender, economic distress, conflict, violence, and climate crisis impacts.
Most of the displaced people across the world are situated in hot regions, such as Pakistan, and, like Abrar, live in poor quality shelters with limited access to health services, which puts them at a high risk of exposure to extreme heat.
Pakistan is now one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, according to the
Climate Risk Index 2025
. The intersection of climate change and internal displacement presents a complex array of challenges, both immediate and long-term term for cities and for the people who are forced to migrate to them.
Internal displacements in Pakistan due to Climate Disasters. — source: IDMC 2023
At the same time, it also adds to the ongoing infrastructural, economic, and demographic challenges in cities like Karachi, already brimming with a population of over 25 million. These challenges are deeply interwoven across environmental, socio-economic, governance and infrastructure domains.
According to the
Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre
(IDMC), there have been over 24.3 million internal displacements between 2009 and 2023, due to 107 disaster events — droughts, wildfires, wet mass movements and floods — in Pakistan. Floods alone have accounted for 24.1 million of such displacements.
Both the 2010 and 2022 floods triggered extensive displacements and migrations from rural to urban areas, Karachi being a major recipient here in Sindh. Even though there is no clear-cut data on displacement and the resulting migration induced by heatwaves, urban heat islands are, nevertheless, exacerbating the vulnerability of displaced people as they endeavour to adapt to new urban environments.
The long road from rural to urban
In Sindh, frequent and intense flooding, coupled with the deterioration of the Indus River Delta system, droughts and water scarcity, have triggered large-scale migrations of rural-agrarian populations into cities such as Karachi, Hyderabad, and Jacobabad, where basic services are already stretched.
There are several critical challenges that emerge from these dynamics and are particularly relevant to Sindh and Balochistan. The most fundamental challenge is the absence of robust climate information systems and the dearth of resilient infrastructures, both of which can easily compound displaced people’s vulnerability.
Furthermore, given the weak coordination between national and local governments, the process for receiving, managing and reintegrating or resettling displaced people is often poorly managed or is ad hoc. The absence of a centralised registry, policy and planning framework further exacerbates these challenges.
One challenge that is often overlooked is the overcrowding of informal settlements, which largely takes place when displaced families end up living in informal or low-income settlements. In Karachi, these are typically situated along the coast, such as Ibrahim Hyderi, Rehri Goth and Lath Basti, or in peri-urban areas such as Sindhabad and Tent City Hawkesbay, where infrastructure services are largely absent.
Hence, there is increased strain on housing, water, sanitation, healthcare and transport. This can generate tensions between new migrants and the older communities that host them. Some of the migrants who arrived in Karachi after the 2022 floods perceived a difference in terms of how they were welcomed and accommodated.

“I feel like the people of Karachi have not accepted us with an open heart this time; not the way they did many of those who arrived after the floods in 2010,” said a resident at the Tent City.
This issue is intensified by the ongoing challenge of tenure security, whereby displaced people risk being evicted when they — unknowingly or otherwise — squat on public land to build shelter. Consequently, they are forced to navigate risks at various scales.
The missing piece of the puzzle
The challenges do not end here. The difficulties mentioned above intersect with existing gaps in data on displaced people migrating to urban centres. Even though migrants are documented in various surveys by the
Pakistan Bureau of Statistics
(PBS), these documents often fail to capture the scale of migration that has grown due to the impacts of the climate crisis.
For instance, the
Labour Force Survey
lists the causes of migration as either economic (including job transfer, searching for a job or better agricultural land, business, etc); social (education, health, marriage, who they migrated with, change or residence, etc); security/law & order situation; natural disaster; and ‘other’. However, the climate change-related disaster category is not disaggregated into what types or for how long ago.
Similarly, the
Pakistan Social & Living Standard Measurement Survey
(PSLM) lists only the proportion of migrant vs non migrant populations across the country, but not the causes of migration. In fact, it defines a migrant as someone who is ‘born in one district and at the time of interview living [sic] in another district’.
The national Census 2023 is less clear: the reasons for migration include job/ business, education, marriage, with family, back to home, and others. Even though, as a census, it is meant to capture such information, there is no coverage given to climate-induced displacement and the resulting migration. Thus, data-wise, it is difficult to gauge the impact of climate change-induced migrations on demographics, labour, and urban indicators.
There are also gaps in the decentralisation of service provision whereby local governments in cities such as Karachi lack the authority, resources, or at times the legal mandate to manage post-disaster migration flows effectively.
This creates a vacuum that philanthropists, NGOs or charitable organisations often fill by deploying their own models of service delivery in certain neighbourhoods, rather than in districts as a whole, simply because they don’t possess the capacity that the state holds.
Post-resettlement challenges
In the broader landscape of city and regional planning across Pakistan, urban planners hardly engage with the increasingly critical issue of integrating climate adaptation, displacement, and migration flows in terms of how these will shape development plans, especially the availability of shelter, jobs, health services and land.
Across Pakistan’s cities, economic marginalisation and livelihood insecurity feed into displaced people’s lives. They are often forced to rely on precarious, low-wage, undocumented jobs that offer no social protection. At most, they take up menial labour tasks, vending, or unskilled construction work.
“
Ghurbat bohot hai idhar
(there is a lot of poverty here),” explained Abdul, who lives at the Tent City. “Many people beg on the roads; others work as labourers; some women sell bangles. We used to be respectable farmers, but we have been forced to become beggars.”
Abdul’s story echoed through the weak walls of most of the houses at the settlement, showing how the loss of rural livelihoods — caused by climate change — is rarely offset by comparable opportunities in urban centres.
Moreover, there are significant mental health and social stress-associated challenges that displacement often triggers. These manifest in different ways for men, women, children and the elderly. Even though displaced people who migrate to cities often adapt to their new urban environments, the process also generates adverse experiences, intergenerational trauma, and compounded vulnerabilities — children miss out on education, play spaces, and can be
exposed to malnutrition
.
On the other hand, displaced women might be more exposed to the effects of extreme heat that could impact nutrition due to the absence of safe and clean water that is essential for hydration, cooking and hygiene. This risk is even more pronounced if they are breastfeeding and responsible for household chores, with exposure to heat sources.
These conditions then give way to long-term health consequences such as chronic kidney diseases, gastrointestinal illnesses and adverse effects on the body’s thermoregulation abilities. Furthermore, floods and extreme heat amplify existing urban inequalities, with migrants being hit the hardest due to the inadequate provision of safe shelter, location in flood-prone or heat-intensified zones, and lack of health services, insurance, credit, or safety nets.
Effective governance of displaced people requires, at the bare minimum, a recognition by the state of the complexities of climate-change-induced displacement, in addition to the problems encountered during phases of post-resettlement to a temporary or even a permanent site.
The case of Sindhabad
The aforementioned issues are on show in Sindhabad, an informal settlement located near the Karachi-Hyderabad Super Highway. It has served as a place of refuge for displaced people who migrated to Karachi during the 2010 and 2022 floods.
Typically, people here live in makeshift shelters and with limited access to water, sanitation, electricity, primary healthcare and education. According to the residents, they convinced PBS representatives who were conducting census surveys around their neighbourhood in 2023 to include their settlement in the assessment.
Sindhabad, 2023. — photo by authors
Today, Sindhabad has a population of 152,381, with an average family size of five persons per household. Given that, on average, families have three children, there are approximately 91,428 children out of school in the locality.
The problems of inaccessible infrastructure are pervasive, which often leads to violent outcomes as residents navigate a precarious route to access water.
“Here, you have to sacrifice your life just to get water,” said Preeti, 45.
“Two years ago, we lost our daughter because she was crossing the highway to get water. A speeding truck hit her and her friend … my daughter died on the spot, and her friend was disabled,“ the grief-stricken mother recalled.
Preeti’s words reveal the brutal reality that displaced people must face at times, compelled to find water as they adapt in perilous environments where essential services are often absent or located far away.
Thinking about effective policy
Despite these glaring ground realities, there is limited solid data available at the urban level on internal displacement and the ensuing migration driven by climate crisis impacts in Pakistan.
Local governments often rely on voluntary registrations, making targeted planning and relief provision difficult across cities. There is limited disaggregation by gender, age, ethnicity or vulnerability levels, and the absence of integrated data systems between agencies such as the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and urban planning departments.
Even though a positive step has been taken at the national level in terms of establishing a Global Climate-Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC) in Islamabad, which is dedicated to producing research on Pakistan, there is still an urgent need for clear-cut, cohesive interventions for policy action.
Here are some necessary actions, at the bare minimum, to tackle the challenge of climate-change-induced internal displacement and migration for immediate as well as long-term planning for Pakistan’s cities.
Legal and institutional framework:
develop a national framework for climate change-driven displacement and migration, and recognise the different kinds of climate migrants. Develop a spatial database of migrant populations disaggregated by socio-demographic indicators, for relief purposes
Urban planning and adaptation:
strengthen urban planning with climate adaptation and inclusive zoning, including resumption of work on the Internal Migration Policy and introducing District-level Climate Action Plans
Housing and basic services:
invest in climate-resilient housing and services in informal settlements, learning from and enhancing already existing practices and materials
Data and monitoring:
improve data collection on internal displacement and establish mandatory climate migration registration in all host cities
Local governance and transparency:
empower local governments with resources and authority to manage migrant integration and increased transparency in fund management and allocation
Disaster and climate strategies:
integrate migration considerations into disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate resilience strategies

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943592/justices-vs-ihc,Justices vs IHC - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE judiciary’s decline will be underwritten by the apathy of those it depends on to fight vigorously for its integrity and independence.
It is this realisation, perhaps, that prompted five senior judges of the Islamabad High Court to
march
to the Supreme Court on Friday. There, they lodged separate but similar petitions against what they, and many in the legal community, consider serious issues undermining the IHC’s integrity and independence.
Images of the five justices, seated around a table, waiting — as ordinary petitioners do — while court staff processed their paperwork quickly made their way to social media. They were shared widely as the nation processed with growing trepidation the most visible symptom yet of what seems to be the judiciary’s hastening collapse. The petitioner judges themselves framed it in similar terms: “The demolition of the IHC and its independence, that is being witnessed today, is only because the petitioner judges dared to object to the executive’s interference in their judicial work and uphold their oath as judges of the IHC.”
This is an alarming development. The judiciary, one of the pillars of the state, has signalled that it may be too divided to be able to keep the constitutional order stable. The implications of this will not be lost on the public. Nor should they be lost on the powerful. The authorities should not need reminding that the Constitution envisions a tripartite separation of powers whereby each branch of the state is supposed to be independent.
The doctrine is meant to keep any institution from accumulating so much power that the prospect of political tyranny becomes a possibility. Worryingly, Pakistan seems to be making itself quite comfortable with absolutism. Where once ideals like civil liberties and independent institutions found spirited champions willing to fight for them, one now sees a complacency that too often resembles complete surrender.
Perhaps it was frustration with the status quo that pushed five serving judges to take such an extreme step. When justice becomes hard to come by, it must be fought for. That this fight has been taken to a court is a sign that, perhaps, not all is lost. As long as the courts can be expected to do justice, there is hope for course correction. It is when hope is lost that anarchy takes over.
Other countries in this corner of the world have seen violent upheavals in recent years over different strains of state dysfunction. All those with power, political or any other kind, must therefore work to prevent any such crisis from unfolding in Pakistan. The constitutional order and the boundaries it demarcates must be respected, and the law should remain above all other considerations. It is time justice is done, and is seen to be done.

Local sources claimed that fighter jets targeted militant hideouts in the Bakkakhel area of Bannu district, killing terrorists and injuring many others.
They said that a community hall and a school being used by the terrorists as safe havens and for storing explosive devices, rocket launchers, ammunition and explosives, were destroyed in the strikes on Saturday and Sunday.
The military’s media wing said that security forces killed 31 terrorists during the intelligence-based operations in Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts. There was no mention of the aerial strikes in the official statement.
Five security officials, including army captain, martyred in Kech blast
The ISPR said that the operations were conducted by the security forces on the reported presence of
Khawarij
in the area.
The term
‘Fitna al Khawarij’
is used by the state to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakis­tan (TTP). It said that during the operation in Lakki Marwat, security forces effectively engaged the terrorist location and, after an intense exchange of fire, 14 Indian-sponsored
Khawarij
were eliminated.
“Another intelligence-based operation was conducted in Bannu, and in the ensuing exchange of fire, 17 more
Khawarij
were neutralised by the security forces”, the statement added.
The ISPR said that sanitisation operation was underway to eliminate any remaining Indian-sponsored
Khawarij

in the Shaikh Badin mountain range in Lakki Marwat district had also been reported, prompting security personnel to be placed on high alert and launch operations.
According to the source, the successful operation by security forces would help halt the terrorists’ movements and disrupt their plans.
Five security men martyred
On the other hand, in Balochistan’s Kech district, five security personnel, including an officer, were martyred in an explosion on Monday.
Official sources, while confirming the attack, said that militants planted an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Mand area, near Pak-Iran border. The device was detonated by a remote control to target the vehicle moving between tehsil Dashat and Mand.
“The vehicle was blown up and all five security personnel were martyred,” a senior official told

, identifying the martyred officer as Captain Waqir Kakar.
Other martyred personnel were identified as Naik Junaid, Naik Asmat, Lance Naik Khan Muhammad and Sepoy Zahoor Ahmed.
After receiving information about the incident, security forces rushed to the site and shifted the bodies to nearby health facilities.
Later, the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the IED attack.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti paid tribute in a statement on X, saying: “Another brave son of Balochistan, Captain Waqir Kakar, embraced martyrdom while defending the people and his beloved Pakistan. His sacrifice will forever remain a shining chapter of courage and honour. Balochistan and Pakistan will never forget you.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939594/kidnapped-newborn-recovered-two-women-held-in-lahore,"Kidnapped newborn recovered, two women held in Lahore - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","LAHORE: The examination of more than 500 private and Safe City surveillance cameras in around 10-kilometre radius of the densely-populated several localities during the last 48 hours, has helped the police recover the newborn who was allegedly kidnapped by two veiled women from the Lahore General Hospital.
Resident of Kahna, the woman had delivered a boy some 10 years after her marriage.
She had undergone trauma when she came to know about the kidnap of her son from the labour room two days back.
The Model Town division SP, the Kot Lakhpat SHO and the investigation officers were deputed by Operations DIG Faisal Kamran for the recovery of the child.
A senior police official told
Dawn
that the women [apparently] took advantage of the ‘loopholes’ in the hospital’s mechanism of handing over the newborns to their parents.
As per the reports, he said, there was an elaborated system of separation between the mother and the newborn after birth in the labour, maternity ward and in the neonatal unit.
He said the women not only breached the hospital’s security mechanism but also managed to dodge the top administration.
He said they tried to dodge the law enforcers/police as they not only frequently changed the routes but also used various vehicles (rickshaw) to reach their destination after abducting the baby.
Soon after kidnap, the official said, the women booked a rickshaw and left it at a point to hire another three-wheeler and travelled for a certain distance.
From that point, the women walked for more than 1.5 kilometer and kept on watching their surroundings.
Later, they again hired another rickshaw and reached a home at Kamahan, some 10 kilometers away from the Lahore General Hospital.
He said multiple teams were tasked to work on the kidnap case after initial assessment that they may use three possible routes to escape from the LGH.
According to the official, the Safe City Authority played a decisive role in the recovery of the newborn.
“During the last 48 hours, we examined more than 500 privately installed cameras and those of the Safe City Authority,” he said.
Finally, some plainclothesmen who were assisting other officials reached a house where the women had entered along with the baby, he said, adding that they recovered the newborn and arrested both of them.
To a question, the official said police were questioning the women as to how they kidnapped the baby. “It seems the women had either bribed the lower staff or took advantage of the loopholes in the laid-down system at the hospital”.
As per the guidelines, he said: “The baby is handed over to the parents or other key family members after noting in the official record the thumb impressions of those taking custody of the child.”
“The police will investigate the staff members deputed in the gynae emergency ward at the time of the kidnap,” he said.
Later, the Model Town division investigation SP told a news conference that one of the women who kidnapped the baby was married and issueless. He said she was facing some domestic problems and planned to kidnap the child to secure her matrimonial life.

The
report
, titled “Reclaiming Momentum Towards Prosperity: Pakistan’s Poverty, Equity and Resilience Assessment”, marks the first comprehensive evaluation of poverty and welfare trends in the country since the early 2000s, according to a WB
press release
today.
According to the release, the national poverty rate has begun to rise again since 2020, after a steady decline from 64.3 per cent in 2001-02 to 21.9pc in 2018-19.
“This is largely owing to compounding shocks — including COVID-19, inflation, floods, and macroeconomic stress — but also because the consumption-driven growth model that delivered early gains has reached its limits,” it said.
The report explored data from 25 years of household surveys, now casted projections, and geospatial analysis, as well as unique sources of administrative data.
The Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) informed the WB’s official poverty estimates. Beyond the latest available survey round in 2018-19, it used microsimulation models to project estimates, saying that new poverty estimates and trends would be produced after the release of the recently collected HIES 2024-25 data.
The WB found that the reduction of poverty was primarily a result of rising income from non-agricultural labour, with more households moving from farm work to service jobs.
“However, slow and uneven structural transformation has hindered diversification, job creation, and inclusive growth,” it said, adding that this resulted in low productivity across sectors that constrained income growth. It also pointed out that over 85pc of jobs remained informal and women and youth remained “largely excluded” from the labour force.
Other observations included that nearly 40pc of children were stunted and that a quarter of primary-school-aged children were
out of school
, while 75pc of those attending primary school had very limited reading comprehension skills.
Additionally, the report found a widespread deficit in public services, with only half of all households having safely managed access to
drinking water
in 2018 and 31pc lacking safe sanitation.
“The report underscores systematic, complex, and persistent spatial disparities in welfare across Pakistan,” the press release said. “Rural poverty remains more than twice as high as urban poverty, and many districts that lagged behind decades ago continue to do so today. Furthermore, unplanned urbanisation has led to ‘sterile agglomeration’ — crowded settlements with low living standards.”
The WB report called for “sustained and people-centred reforms” to protect vulnerable families, improve livelihood opportunities, and expand access to basic services to alleviate these concerns.
One of the lead authors of the report, Senior Economist Christina Wieser, said, “Reforms that expand access to quality services, protect households from shocks, and create better jobs — especially for the bottom 40pc — are essential to break cycles of poverty and deliver durable, inclusive growth.”
The report outlined four pathways to restoring progress in the fight against poverty. It highlighted the need for investment in people, places and public services, accompanied by strengthening local governance, and advocated for responsive and inclusive safety nets to increase household shock resilience.
It also stressed the importance of progressive fiscal measures, including improving municipal finance and targeting investment in the poorest of the country, and recommended investing in timely data systems to support efficient decision-making processes and track progress.
“It will be critical to protect Pakistan’s hard-won poverty gains while accelerating reforms that expand jobs and opportunities — especially for women and young people,” said Bolormaa Amgaabazar, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.
“By focusing on results — investing in people, places, and access to opportunities; building resilience against shocks; prioritising fiscal management; and developing better data systems for decision-making — Pakistan can put poverty reduction back on track.”

strong opposition
to the construction of
Kalabagh Dam
, Awami National Party provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain on Tuesday declared the project a conspiracy to ‘sink’ Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead of being a reservoir.
“The Kalabagh Dam will be disastrous for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan, so its construction will never be allowed,” he said at a relief camp established by the Khudai Khidmatgar Movement in Charsadda for the victims of a recent earthquake in Afghanistan.
ANP provincial leader Hamid Toofan, district general secretary Shehzaduddin and leader Mian Rahim Bacha were also present.
Mr Hussain said that the people who opposed the 18th Constitutional Amendment and the renaming of the province were playing politics in the name of dams.
Insists project will ‘sink’ Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
He said that the real solution to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s water woes lied in Mohmand, Dasu and Bhasha dams and not Kalabagh Dam.
“Had the Kalabagh Dam existed during the 2010 floods, the entire Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would have been submerged and the destruction would have multiplied many times,” he said.
The ANP leader said that large dams were dangerous and could cause devastation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, so small dams should be built.
He added that even in major countries like China, small dams were constructed.
Criticising the Saifullah family, Mr Hussain said that Saleem Saifullah, Javed Saifullah, Anwar Saifullah, Kulsoom Bibi and Usman Saifullah all held government positions but failed to achieve anything notable for the people of Lakki Marwat.
“Before questioning others, Saifullahs should examine their own acts and answer the people,” he said.
The ANP leader said that since the creation of Pakistan, Punjab had monopolised water, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was not even getting its full share.
He said that under the 1991 Water Accord, the province received only 14 per cent of water but due to a lack of canal system, it was unable to utilise even that share.
“Vast areas could be irrigated through dams in Nowshera and Peshawar,” he said.
He claimed that government reports had highlighted that Kalabagh Dam would be destructive for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan, so the ANP would never accept it and would continue its struggle against it.
Mr Hussain said that for earthquake victims in Afghanistan, his party had set up relief camps across the province, so people should actively participate in the noble cause of relief.
He said that the repatriation of Afghan refugees should be “paused” on humanitarian grounds to ease their difficulties.
The ANP leader said that better Pak-Afghan relations were the need of the hour as they would help eliminate terrorism.

Police spokesperson told the media that five class IX students were on their way to tuition centre on Monday afternoon when their five friends forcibly took them into a house where they tortured the five nine-graders with plastic pipes and sticks and also forced them to rape each other.
‘Y’, father of a victim, claimed in his FIR registered under sections 375-A, 365 and 337-V of Pakistan Penal Code that when his son did not return home after tuition, he along with fathers of four other children started a search and found them in a house locked from inside near Officers Colony on Pattan Road while the suspects managed their escape.
The spokesperson claimed that three of the nominated suspects were arrested and raids were underway to nab two others.
He said the suspects took revenge for a quarrel that occurred a day ago with the victims in the football ground.
MURDER CASE RESOLVED:The blind murder case of a man from Chak 142 RB, Faisalabad, has been traced, with his own brother identified as the killer.
According to Sahianwala police, the deceased, Adnan, had gone to a mosque to offer prayers on Sept 14 but did not return home. The following day (Sept 15), his body was recovered from an under-construction outhouse, bearing marks of slaughter.
During the investigation, police took his brother, Hamza, into custody. He later confessed to killing Adnan over a property dispute.
FESCO:The Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) has claimed that 81 feeders were affected by the recent floods in the districts of Dera Ismail Khan (KP), Jhang, Chiniot, Sargodha, Mianwali, Toba Tek Singh, and Faisalabad. Out of these, power supply has been permanently restored on 62 feeders and temporarily on 19 feeders.
A Fesco spokesperson informed on Tuesday that electricity supply to 204,383 consumers had been disrupted. Of these, supply to 198,878 consumers has already been restored, while emergency teams are working around the clock to fully restore electricity to the remaining consumers.
He added that repair work on transmission lines and fallen poles in flood-affected areas will be completed once the water level recedes further.

Police said that a group of terrorists came to the branch of National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) located on the Bannu-D I Khan section of Indus Highway, broke the locks, smashed doors and windows and set the building on fire.
“It is not yet clear how much the assailants looted from the bank,” they maintained, saying the bank officials are being approached to assess the actual financial and property loss.
They said the terrorists left before the police reached the spot. A Rescue 1122 official said that a team of firefighters was dispatched to the venue when the control room received information about the incident.
He said the firefighters extinguished the fire after hectic efforts.
The fire, however, destroyed the building completely, he said.
Police said they had launched a search for the assailants in the surrounding areas.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943577/ppp-insists-on-bisp-use-to-help-flood-survivors,PPP insists on BISP use to help flood survivors - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: Amid app­arent
reluctance
by the federal government to use the Benazir Income Support Pro­gramme (BISP) to help the flood survivors, the PPP has once again urged the Centre to disburse stipends among displaced citizens via the “efficient and proven” BISP.
Over the past weeks, the PPP chairman and senior leaders have encouraged the use of the flagship income support initiative to provide relief to thousands of citizens affected by the monsoon floods. Earlier this week, its vice president, Sherry Rehman, had “strongly and repeatedly”
advocated
the use of BISP for the purpose in a Senate committee meeting.
On Saturday, another PPP leader Humayun Khan urged the government to do the same. His statement came days after PML-N leader and PM’s aide Rana  Sanaullah expressed apprehensions about the BISP, calling it unviable for a cash-strapped government. Rana Sana said the BISP could not be  continued in its current form — it either needed to be wrapped up or be  completely revamped.
The PML-N leader had suggested ‘Benazir Rozgar Scheme’ or ‘Hunarmand Scheme’ would be a more effective way to provide skills and employment opportunities to its beneficiaries instead of a monthly stipend. He had said the matter would be discussed in parliament, claiming that even some PPP leaders were also in agreement with this proposal.
In a statement on Saturday, PPP Secretary General Humayun Khan reiterated his party’s demand that relief activities should be fast-tracked through the BISP, named after former premier late Benazir Bhutto.
He said that the federal government should provide immediate financial assistance to the flood-affected families through the BISP. He emphasised the BISP was a “proven, transparent, and efficient mechanism capable of delivering direct support” to the country’s most vulnerable populations.
“In these critical times, the affected families are in desperate need of urgent support. BISP is the most reliable platform for ensuring swift and fair distribution of relief funds,” he said. The PPP leader urged the government to put aside political differences and act purely on humanitarian grounds, ensuring that relief efforts were carried out without delay or discrimination.
“This is not the time for political point-scoring. It is a time for solidarity and action. The government must mobilise all available resources to assist those in need through BISP’s transparent system,” he added.
At least 910 people have lost their lives in the torrential rains and flash floods across the country since June 26, according to the National Disaster Management Authority,
APP
reported on Sept 8. It was reported that 1,044 people were injured, 7,850 houses were destroyed, and 6,180 livestock were killed.

In a post on X on Sunday night, Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on scoring a win in the final against the Green Shirts, calling it a continuation of India’s
Operation Sindoor
— an operation that was launched against Pakistan during the four-day military
conflict
between the two countries in May.
“

In response to Modi’s post, Naqvi said, “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s
success
during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”.
“Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he said.
The exchange also follows the Indian cricket team
refusing
to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries.
“I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said on Sunday night.

“I think what has happened in this tournament is very disappointing,” Agha said.
“If they think they disrespected us by not shaking hands, then I say they disrespected cricket.”
“What they did today, a good team doesn’t do that. Good teams do what we have done. We waited for our medals and took them.
“It’s been seen for the first time. I do not know where it will stop. What has happened in this tournament is bad for cricket,” he said.
Meanwhile, Yadav claimed that India was “denied” the trophy, but then went on to say that the team “took the call on the ground about not taking the trophy”.
“If you tell me about the trophies, my trophies are sitting in my dressing room — all the 14 players and support staff. They are the real trophies for me,” said Yadav.
‘Lack of sportsmanship’
Although the Pakistan-India matches went ahead despite
calls
from the Indian side to boycott them, all three were marred by controversy and high tensions between the two countries in the wake of their four-day
military standoff
in May.
India displayed consistent hostility towards the Pakistan team throughout each of their clashes, including
refusing
to shake hands with the players at the end of the games.
In addition, after the first victory against Pakistan on September 14, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav was accused of politicising the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May, for which India blamed Islamabad without evidence.
Naqvi had expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” in a post on X and
lodged
a complaint with the ICC, which launched a probe into the remarks.
Further, during the September 21
match
, when the rivals met for the second time, Pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the match.
The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the
Pahalgam attack
in occupied Kashmir, which killed more than two dozen people. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US
intervention

The city is bracing for heavy rainfall over the coming days as strong monsoon currents penetrate Sindh as the PMD had said a day ago that a deep depression was expected to enter the southeastern parts of the province from India today.
While issuing a severe weather warning, the PMD had highlighted the likelihood of torrential rains, gusty winds and possible urban flooding across Karachi and other parts of Sindh.
According to rainfall figures from the PMD as of 5pm today, University Road received the most rain with 8.8 millimetres, followed by Gulshan-i-Maymar (8mm), Gulshan-i-Hadeed (7mm), Airport Old Area (6.6mm), Saadi Town (4.3mm), Korangi (4mm), PAF Faisal Base 3mm), Jinnah Terminal (2.8mm), Nazimabad (1.5mm), North Karachi (1.2mm) and Keamari (1mm).
In a message on X at 4:12pm, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said it had begun to rain again and urged people to avoid unnecessary movement.
He also held a meeting with senior Karachi officials regarding rain preparations, saying they agreed on alternate routes and traffic diversions in case of any eventuality.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority was directed to remain in the field with dewatering machines, pumps, and other necessary equipment to ensure the timely drainage of rainwater.
The PDMA director general informed the meeting’s members that 16 dewatering pumps were already installed at various choke points across the city.
He also said that rescue kits would be provided to field officers to enable immediate assistance to citizens and Rescue 1122 teams were put on high alert to respond promptly in case of emergencies and to carry out rescue operations with machinery to be deployed at key points, while the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation would establish special camps to provide guidance and support to citizens.
Wahab was told that the cleaning of storm drains and choke points was expedited and union council chairmen were directed to ensure drainage of rainwater from inner streets during the rain spell.
The members also decided that control rooms would be established at the Commissioner’s Office and Police Office to ensure close coordination among all institutions.
K-Electric officials assured the meeting’s members that special control points were already set up to ensure an uninterrupted power supply during the rains.
Sindh Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah stressed that all institutions must work in close coordination with a joint strategy to ensure smooth traffic management, effective drainage, and maximum facilitation for the people of Karachi during the upcoming rains.
On the order of the Sindh CM, the chief secretary conducted a review of the city’s preparedness for ongoing and expected rainfall.
According to a spokesperson, all deputy commissioners are on high alert along with their teams to manage any emergency situation.
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi has issued instructions to ensure smooth traffic flow throughout the city, while the DIG Traffic made a tour of various areas to oversee and implement traffic control measures.
“The district administration and municipal bodies are actively working to provide maximum public convenience,” the commissioner said.
A control room has been established at the Commissioner’s Office to continuously monitor the situation in the city and coordinate a timely response where needed.
The Karachi Traffic Police have issued an advisory urging residents to avoid low-lying areas and use designated alternate routes to stay safe.
In District Central, key roads like Powerhouse Chowrangi to Nagan Chowrangi are prone to waterlogging, the advisory read.
Commuters were advised to use diversions via Shafiq Mor, Godhra, and New Karachi. Those heading to North Nazimabad Blocks N, H, I can take routes through Imtiaz Store, Mujahid Colony, and Peoples Chowrangi.

heavy rainfall
over the coming days as strong monsoon currents
penetrate
Sindh as a deep depression is expected to enter the southeastern parts of the province from India within the next 24 hours, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said on Sunday.
While issuing a severe weather warning, the PMD highlighted the likelihood of torrential rains, gusty winds and possible urban flooding across Karachi and other parts of Sindh.
“Thunderstorm and rains are expected tomorrow [Monday] in Karachi with possibility of heavy falls,” said PMD’s focal person Anjum Nazeer Zaigham.
An advisory issued by the PMD stated that a depression over southwest Rajasthan and adjoining Guajrat has intensified further into a deep depression. “It is very likely to move westward and entered in southeastern Sindh during the next 24 hours causing widespread rains with strong winds.”
During the day, Karachi experienced overcast and humid conditions, with dense cloud cover persisting throughout. Light rain was also reported in the outskirts of the city.
The maximum temperature in the city was 32.6 degrees Celsius with 75 per cent humidity, increasing the discomfort for residents even before the anticipated downpour.
The Met office has warned that thundershowers with strong gusty winds and scattered “heavy to very heavy falls” are likely in Karachi Division, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal, Dadu, and Mirpurkhas until September 10.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari has called on all institutions to remain fully prepared in view of the heavy rains in Sindh.
He directed provincial, district and municipal authorities to stay on high alert and ensure advance arrangements. He also emphasised the need for close monitoring of water levels in Hub Dam and other reservoirs to safeguard communities.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941002/cabinet-approves-resumption-of-new-gas-connections-declares-climate-and-agriculture-emergencies,Cabinet approves resumption of new gas connections; declares climate and agriculture emergencies - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik on Wednesday announced that the federal cabinet has approved the resumption of new gas connections across the country, ending the
ban
imposed in 2021.
Briefing the media on cabinet decisions along with Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, he said the government had responded to strong public demand by lifting the restriction on new connections.
He said the cabinet took several key decisions, including restoring new domestic gas connections, particularly in newly developed housing areas where residents had been forced to rely on LPG cylinders and alternative fuels.
The minister assured that both Sui companies had already completed procurement processes for meters and pipelines, and would immediately begin processing pending applications once the official notification is issued.
Existing applicants would also be given the option to convert their requests to RLNG-based connections by paying the prescribed security fee to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, he added.
Highlighting the government’s commitment to easing the energy burden on citizens, the minister said the decision would help reduce household fuel expenses and provide much-needed relief amid inflation.
He explained that although RLNG would remain costlier than domestic natural gas, it would be around 30–35 per cent cheaper than LPG, thereby easing household fuel costs.
“We already have a surplus of RLNG and adequate electricity availability, but we are working to strengthen governance and sustainability in the sector,” he added.
He said that one bidding round for domestic gas exploration had already been completed, while another would conclude soon.
Chaudhry said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had decided to lift the ban on domestic gas connections imposed in 2021 to address a longstanding public demand.
He expressed gratitude to the premier and the petroleum minister for resolving a major issue that households had been facing for years. “The difficulties caused by the suspension of gas connections will now be resolved,” he added.
Malik said efforts were also being made to attract international companies, including those from Turkiye, China and the United States, for both onshore and offshore exploration.
“By gradually boosting local production, we aim to reduce reliance on RLNG and provide cheaper, indigenous fuel to the people,” he said.
He reiterated the government’s determination to achieve sustainability in the energy sector, reduce dependence on costly imports, and gradually shift towards indigenous fuel resources.
On the floods, he said the prime minister was personally supervising a comprehensive damage assessment in consultation with provinces. The federal government, he assured, would fulfil its responsibility to provide maximum relief to the victims.
Cabinet declares climate, agriculture emergencies
Meanwhile, Chaudhry said the federal cabinet declared both a climate and agriculture emergency in the country.
Sharing details of the cabinet meeting, he said the premier had decided, and the cabinet endorsed, the immediate enforcement of a climate emergency.
Climate change, he said, was already one of the most debated subjects globally and was severely affecting Pakistan through shifting weather patterns.
“Unfortunately, in past decades, we failed to protect our forests and trees, while encroachments narrowed natural waterways — rivers, streams, and channels that once allowed easy passage of rainwater. This has worsened the flooding situation we see today,” he said.
The minister added that the climate minister was tasked with submitting a comprehensive report to PM Shehbaz within 15 days. He added that the cabinet would deliberate on the report, to figure out how Pakistan could cope with climatic challenges and prepare effective strategies to protect the nation from such devastating losses in the future.
“Since 2022, we have witnessed the devastation caused by floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and Punjab. Now, this water is flowing into Sindh from the five-river basin, and our prayers and efforts are focused on minimising the losses there as well,” he said.
The minister said the floods had caused massive destruction, particularly to agriculture, along with human and financial losses — a matter discussed in detail during the cabinet meeting.
An agriculture emergency, he said, would help assess the extent of damage to agriculture across the country and determine how farmers can be compensated for their losses.
Chaudhry stressed that climate and agriculture challenges could not be addressed without the cooperation, support, and consultation of provincial governments.
Therefore, he said the prime minister had decided to convene an immediate meeting of all provincial stakeholders under the leadership of their respective chief ministers.
“This country belongs to all of us, and together we must overcome its challenges,” he said, adding that stakeholders from GB and Azad Kashmir would also participate in the huddle.",2025-09-10,APP,1262,0.000155

Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said the body of the girl, identified as Asiya, was brought to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital on Monday evening for a post-mortem examination.
The autopsy revealed she had been subjected to sexual violence and was strangled to death. The surgeon added that samples had been taken to check for intoxication.
In a statement on Tuesday, police confirmed that the medical officer’s report indicated the victim was strangled. Police also said the suicide was staged to hide the murder.
Residents had initially informed Madadgar-15 police about the girl’s body hanging inside a home in Surjani Town’s Sector-5-A.
The victim’s father, Abdullah, told the police he had gone for work and left his daughter and son, Raheel, at home. He later received the news of his daughter’s death.
A spokesperson for the West SSP said that because the family appeared reluctant to pursue the case, the police have decided to register a case on behalf of the state through a police officer.
Meanwhile, a 40-year-old woman was killed for “honour” in Korangi on Tuesday, police said.
The  Awami Colony added that Zeenat Bibi was killed with a hard and blunt  instrument, allegedly by her husband, Qamber Ali, in Bilal Colony.  Police said she was killed over so-called honour and that the suspect  has been arrested. Her body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate  Medical Centre for medico-legal procedures.

Niazi was
handed over
to the military for trial in 2023 over his alleged involvement in the
May 9 riots
at Lahore’s Jinnah House. He was
sentenced
to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment last December.
Niazi filed a petition with the LHC today through his lawyer, Faisal Siddiqui, contending that after being arrested in the May 9 case, he was not presented in a civilian court.
“The transfer of the petitioner’s custody directly to the military authorities without any judicial oversight is patently and wholly without jurisdiction,” the petition, available with
Dawn.com
, argued.
“No application under Section 549(3) (delivery to military authorities of persons liable to be tried by court-martial) [of the] CrPC (Criminal Code of Procedure), 1898, was filed before any court, including the ATC (Anti-Terrorism Court) Lahore … for [the] delivery of custody of the petitioner for trial by court-martial.”
The petition contended that Niazi had not been produced in a civilian court and was illegally handed into the military custody of the 54th Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Battalion by Sarwar Road police station “on a mere letter by a military functionary under the [Federation of Pakistan] without any judicial oversight or judicial process whatsoever”.
“Neither Section 549(3) of the CrPC, 1898, nor Sections 94 (order in case of concurrent jurisdiction of court martial and criminal court) and 59(4) (civil offences) of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952, nor any other provision of the Army Act or any other law empowers the transfer of custody of the petitioner directly from police custody to the military authorities for trial by court-martial without a transfer order by the Civilian Criminal Court,” the petition argued.
The petition added that Niazi was “singled out” of the hundreds of people nominated in the 2023 first information report (FIR) and thousands of people nominated in May 9 cases.
Niazi requested that the court declare the “transfer of the custody of the petitioner from [Sarwar Road police station) to the Commanding Officer 54 Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Battalion … without any judicial proceedings or judicial order, is without jurisdiction, without lawful authority and of no legal effect”.
A similar request was made to declare that the letter demanding Niazi’s transfer be declared without jurisdiction, along with “all subsequent judgments, orders, proceedings or actions, including court-martial proceedings, based on the transfer of the custody of the petitioner … without any judicial proceedings or judicial order”.
The petition also urged the court to “direct the respondents to either release the petitioner or produce him before the [Anti-Terrorism Court, Lahore], in relation to a criminal case arising out of FIR No 96 of 2023 dated [May 10], for further proceedings in accordance with law”.",2025-09-10,Rana Bilal,768,0.000118

Earlier in September, Pakistan
rolled out
the HPV vaccine nationwide as part of the routine immunisation programme to protect adolescent girls against cervical cancer. However, vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan remains a major public health challenge, driven by a mix of misinformation, safety concerns, and mistrust of authorities.
“Success rate in Punjab has been 72pc,” Punjab’s health minister said during an interview with Geo News show “Geo Pakistan”.
“But we have not ended the campaign; instead, we have extended it for three days.”
He added, “The primary reason is that if we administer this vaccine to our girls now, those aged 9 to 14 will get it for free. But after the campaign ends, people will have to pay money for it, and only 9-year-old girls will be able to get it free of charge.”
Referring to the attacks on women health workers while administering vaccines in Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin district, the minister said he has ensured the suspects were arrested and that security measures have been put in place to protect health workers.
In the
latest incident
this week, the HPV vaccination team was performing its duty in a non-formal education school in the village of Ratuwal, within the limits of Kathian Sheikhan police station, when a 55-year-old resident of the village entered the school and attempted to attack a female health supervisor.
He said the rate of refusals was greater at the beginning of the campaign, with only 250,000 girls receiving the vaccine on the first day. However, towards the end, the number of refusals dropped to 90,000 from 300,000 after counselling was provided through their teams.
“More than 5.2 million girls have been vaccinated; however, our target was 7.2 million, which we hope to achieve by Wednesday,” the minister said.",2025-09-29,Dawn.com,497,9.7e-05

Qatar
said
earlier today it would hold the emergency moot in light of the recent developments in the region. Foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said Monday’s meeting would consider “a draft resolution on the
Israeli attack
on the state of Qatar” to be drafted on Sunday at a ministerial meeting.
Israel
targeted
Hamas leaders on Tuesday in strikes on the Qatari capital, killing five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer. The attack drew widespread international
condemnation
, including from Gulf monarchies allied with the United States, Israel’s main backer.
Al-Ansari was quoted as saying by the official
QNA
news agency that the summit reflected “broad Arab and Islamic solidarity with the State of Qatar in the face of Israel’s cowardly aggression … and the categorical rejection of
Israel’s state terrorism
”.
Confirming PM Shehbaz’s participation, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement posted on X that Pakistan was a co-sponsor of the summit. It added that the Israeli attempts to occupy Gaza, expand settlement activities in the occupied West Bank and forcibly displace Palestinians were also part of the decision to hold the summit.
“Heads of states and governments and senior officials from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation member countries are expected to participate in the summit. The summit will be preceded by the preparatory meeting of the foreign ministers on September 14, 2025. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar will participate in the preparatory session,” the FO said.
The FO reiterated that ​Pakistan accorded high importance to its relations with Qatar and strongly condemned Israeli aggression against the country and other regional states.
Among the leaders attending will be Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also be in Doha, but his presence at the meeting is yet to be confirmed.
Analysts say the summit is meant to send Israel a clear signal.
Qatar, which hosts the largest US base in the region, plays a
mediation role
in the Gaza war alongside the United States and Egypt.
The Israeli strikes were “seen across the Gulf as an unprecedented violation of sovereignty and an attack on diplomacy itself”, Andreas Krieg of King’s College London said, adding the summit signalled that “such aggression can’t be normalised”.
“The goal is to draw clear red lines and end the sense in Israel that it can act with impunity,” he said. “Expect a sharper stance on Palestine and a harder edge on Israeli actions.”
Trump hosts Qatar’s PM
Earlier, US President Donald Trump held dinner with the Qatari prime minister in New York on Friday.
Separately, Trump expressed annoyance about the strike in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and sought to assure the Qataris that such attacks would not happen again.
Trump and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani were joined by a top Trump adviser, US special envoy Steve Witkoff.
“Great dinner with POTUS. Just ended,” Qatar’s deputy chief of mission, Hamah Al-Muftah,

The White House confirmed the dinner had taken place but offered no details.
The session followed an hour-long meeting that al-Thani had at the White House on Friday with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
A source briefed on the meeting said they discussed Qatar’s future as a

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940103,Hybrid failures - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"IT is difficult to disagree with the remarks of the Supreme Court’s Justice Athar Minallah, who on Thursday
indicated
that the hybrid system in Pakistan — where unelected powers are actively involved in civilian affairs — is a euphemism for dictatorship.
The veteran judge, while speaking in Karachi, also dwelt on the role the senior judiciary has played in the country’s history by endorsing the unconstitutional moves of strongmen.
Putting it bluntly, he said that the “
77-year judicial history
is not a matter of pride for me”, while giving examples of the Maulvi Tamizuddin
case
, as well as of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s
trial
and Gen Musharraf’s
assaults
on the constitutional order, to prove how at crucial times their lordships have sided with authoritarian rulers to subvert the rule of law. Mr Minallah also praised the bravery of judges who refused to bow before dictators.
Pakistan’s damaging experiments with different forms of hybridity, from earlier decades to the
present day
, have only weakened institutions, particularly parliament and the judiciary. And rarely have proponents of the hybrid system been held to account for their failures; the actual powers wash their hands of mistakes, while their civilian partners face the music. In contrast, in fully functioning democratic systems, elected leaders are held accountable before the voter.
Considering the judiciary’s role, as highlighted by Justice Minallah, in supporting unconstitutional moves — and these grim episodes are well-documented in our history — ‘willing’ collaborators on the bench have worked with usurpers to subvert the constitutional system, often guided by the ‘doctrine of necessity’. Sadly, in the current scenario too, many of their lordships have been
perceived
as coming to the aid of the real powers to give their legal blessings to
doubtful laws
and amendments.
The solution, as Justice Minallah suggested, is deceptively simple on paper, but difficult to put into practice: abiding by the Constitution, with all institutions staying within the bounds prescribed for them by the basic law. In this regard, when the country faces rampant insecurity, it is essential that the military sticks to its core duty of defending Pakistan. We face two major
militant insurgencies
— in KP and Balochistan — while a hostile neighbour to the east, and an unreliable regime in Kabul, mean we must constantly remain vigilant.
In such a situation, if the security apparatus indulges in political management, the focus on defence can become diluted. Whether it is direct military rule or a ‘hybrid’ system, both have left lasting scars on the constitutional system. Hence, there is a need to move away from the hybrid model in the interest of democracy, and in the interests of both the civilian and military leaderships.

The incident also sparked a protest from different associations of the federal and provincial services, including Provincial Management Officers, Pakistan Administrative Services, Provincial Planning Service and a large number of senior bureaucrats outside the chief secretary office.
Officials told
Dawn
that the incident involving special assistant to the chief minister on relief Naik Mohammad took place last Friday when he barged into education secretary Mohammad Khalid’s office in Civil Secretariat along with armed guards and other persons to push the official into withdrawing transfer orders for North Waziristan’s district education officer (female).
An education department’s “situation report” shared with senior government functionaries said that at around 4:30pm on Sept 12, special assistant to chief minister on relief Naik Mohammad, accompanied by his armed guards and 10-15 private individuals, forcibly entered the office of the ESED secretary.
Dept asks officials to work from home for ‘security reasons’
“The group unlawfully intruded into department premises, creating a situation of intimidation and harassment,” it noted.
The report said that the presence of armed personnel, along with aggressive private individuals, caused panic among staff members and disrupted the normal working environment of the office.
It added that during the incident, Naik Mohammad not only threatened staff members but also directly targeted the secretary of the elementary and secondary education department over the phone.
“In his conversation, the special assistant used highly abusive and derogatory language and openly issued life threats, categorically stating either the secretary would remain alive today or he himself would,” the report said,
It said the act of intimidation, coupled with the aggressive behaviour of his armed companions, instilled fear and insecurity among the government officials present and severely undermined the sanctity of the secretariat.
“Naik Mohammad remained in the office of the elementary and secondary education secretary for more than 30 minutes, during which he continuously used abusive and threatening language against the secretary, before eventually leaving the office,” it said.
The incident revolved around the posting of North Waziristan district education officer (female) and such conduct amounts to gross misconduct and represents a direct threat to the safety and security of the secretary as well as his staff members, according to the report.
It said the incident had grave administrative and security implications, necessitating immediate measures for the protection of government functionaries and secretariat premises, and action at the appropriate forum to address the “matter of serious concern.”
The education secretary issued an “office order”, saying in view of threats to the lives of employees of the provincial and district offices of the education department, the prevailing security situation and impending life threats, and to ensure the safety of employees, it had been deemed necessary to take precautionary measures.
It added that all officers in the education department were allowed to work from home from Sept 15 until further orders.
“I, Mohammad Khalid, secretary to the E&SE department, declare the premises of the education department, provincial and district attached formation, autonomous bodies of the department and schools (public and private) out of bound for entry of armed persons with public representatives as well as persons in private capacities,” read the office order.
Meanwhile, different associations of the federal and provincial services including Provincial Management Officers (PMS), Pakistan Administrative Services (PAS), Provincial Planning Service staged protest demonstrations against the incident.
They demanded of the government to provide protection to civil servants.
They shouted slogans against the special assistant over his “rude” behaviour towards the senior officer.
Addressing protesters, PMS Association chairman Noman Wazir said that the protest at the civil secretariat would continue until the aide to the chief minister tendered an apology and the employees were provided with security.
He said besides the secretariat employees, the commissioners, deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners and their subordinate employees would also stop working from today (Tuesday) and wear black armbands as a protest against the incident.
Special assistant to the chief minister on relief Naik Mohammad was not available for comments on the issue.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941981/new-strategy-to-cut-supply-line-of-terrorists-in-border-areas,New strategy to cut supply line of terrorists in border areas - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"KHYBER: On the instructions of Corps Headquarters in Peshawar, security officials posted in different tribal districts located on border with Afghanistan, particularly Khyber and Bajaur, have adopted a new operational strategy by intensifying surveillance of border to halt
infiltration
of terrorists, according to official sources.
“We are in the process of effectively cutting off all their (militant groups operating from Afghanistan) supply lines alongside working on identifying their weaknesses and sources of strength,” they told this scribe.
They said that law enforcement agencies (LEAs) were also at work to restrict terrorists present in bordering regions to their current locations in order to exhaust their fighting skills while avoiding collateral damage to local population.
Sources said that the shift in the strategy was aimed at ensuring that ‘resource feeding’ of terrorists from across the border was severed with simultaneous patrolling of troubled spots with sporadic intelligence operations (IBOs) also in progress to cause maximum damage to internal militant groups.
Officials say intensified border surveillance will halt infiltration of militants into Khyber and Bajaur
They said that the new strategy would help in disconnecting ammunition, financial and human resource replenishment of terrorist groups, especially Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), operating in different tribal districts with their control centres located inside Afghanistan. “These could be disturbed only when we succeed in effectively stopping infiltration from Afghanistan through the porous Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” they insisted.
These officials said when the support chain of terrorist groups from across the border was broken, LAEs could easily exploit the situation to their benefits as it would result in weakening the resolve of outlawed groups due to demoralisation in their ranks owing to resource crunch.
They believed that the upcoming six months, from September to February next year, were an ideal time to effectively check infiltration from Afghanistan as it was generally observed during previous years that most terrorist groups returned to their sanctuaries in Afghanistan in winter or looked for ‘safe heavens’ in the bordering districts to take a break from fighting and also to replenish their resources prior to the onset of ‘spring offensives’.
“Within operational framework, we must capitalise on this ideal time to minimise the chances of these groups to replenish their resources during winter and also effectively work on identifying their sources of strength and weaknesses alongside discouraging local recruitments,” informed official sources said. They added that effective surveillance of the border would also help in declining new recruits from Afghanistan.
These officials believe that with the new operational strategy, LEAs would be in a better position to conduct intelligence-based operations with minimum chances of collateral damage and less opposition from locals, who had been opposing large scale military operations and their forced displacement.
They said that in order to effectively tackle and inflict losses on terrorists groups, LEAs were working on a strategy to provide an escape route to those militants, who had either taken refuge in populated areas or taken locals as hostages.
“At present they are restricted in a bowl where they would either put up resistance or would make locals hostages to use them as a human shield or they would remain dormant,” said officials. They added that once terrorists tried to leave their temporary abodes, they would be effectively eliminated with remote chances of any collateral damage.
“This is a new approach within the domain of operational readiness or framework while this strategy varies from area to area with no specific focus on any one particular region or locality,” they said.
Authorities in May had conveyed to the elders of Tirah and Bara an official message about the launch of a full scale military operation in parts of Tirah where TTP, Lashkar-i-Islam and Hafiz Gul Bahadar group had established their bases and also started receiving Islamic tax (Ushr) on the profit that locals had earned from sale of poppy and other contraband.
Those groups had also established parallel courts where locals were compelled to bring their disputes for adjudication in light of the teachings of Sharia, said sources.
The message about full scale military operation, conveyed through commissioner of Peshawar during at least three official meetings till mid June, was rejected by the elders of both Tirah and Bara.
Locals also opposed their forced displacement prior to the start of any military offensive against outlawed groups in Tirah.
Provincial Disaster Management Authority has also established a registration centre for the families to be evicted from Tirah in Paindi Cheena locality but not a single family has so far registered itself at the centre despite a lapse of four months.
Officials, however, refuted the impression that change in border security strategy was introduced owing to resistance by locals of military operations and their refusal to vacate their houses under pressure from security forces.
They said that security forces would conduct military operations with slight modifications when the situation in any particular area became unavoidable and locals would be shifted to a comparatively safe place for a short duration of time.
Meanwhile, information gathered from different parts of Tirah speak of a calm but uncertain situation as according to locals, militant groups continue to patrol the areas under their influence while the movement of security forces is restricted to their fortified bases.
Security officials in Bagh Maidan Markaz of Tirah had recently conveyed to local elders that no forced displacement would be conducted in Tirah nor would local tribes be compelled to form tribal Lashkars to fight against outlawed militant groups.

• Punjab govt sets Oct 4 deadline to plug Sutlej breaches
• M5 still shut as over 200 villages inundated in south Punjab
• China airlifts tents, blankets for flood-hit families
HYDERABAD/DADU/ LAHO­RE: Kotri Barrage passed the peak of its medium flood on Sat­urday but remained in a medium-flood state through Sunday evening.
On Saturday morning, Kotri recorded 421,075 cusecs upstream and 393,560 cusecs downstream, easing to 412,965 and 386,650 cusecs by noon.
On Sunday, upstream flows were 387,808 cusecs with 362,253 cusecs downstream; some 25,555 cusecs were drawn for the barrage’s four canals. Flood peaks have already moved past Guddu and Sukkur barrages, where flows have normalised.
Meanwhile, high pressure persisted along the Indus at Nasri Bund, Lakhhat Bund, Mid Bangli Bund and Amri Bridge, leading to intensified rescue efforts.
Rescue 1122 Shaheed Benazirabad evacuated dozens of residents from Ali Khan Mari village to safer locations and helped move livestock and belongings.
Officials have termed the situation “alarming” and urged residents in vulnerable areas to remain vigilant and cooperate with rescue teams. Local authorities said they were monitoring embankments and stood ready to take further protective measures.
The Punjab government has set Oct 4 as the deadline to plug all broken embankments along the Sutlej to contain flooding that has submerged more than 200 villages across Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts. The villages of Multan’s tehsil Jalalpur Pirwala, Lodhran and Uch Sharif were submerged after Noraja Bhutta embankment at the Sutlej River broke due to extremely high water flow 15 days ago.
The floodwater passed from these breaches and rose around the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5) from Jhangra in the Bahawalpur district to Jalalpur Pirwala. The floodwater passed through M5 after
breaching
it at several points and created a 20km to 25km-long inland lake between Gilani Road and the motorway.
Due to the breaches, the motorway has been closed for traffic from Uch Sharif interchange to Jalalpur Pirwala for the last 15 days. The closure of all traffic between southern and central Punjab has disrupted supply chains and stranded thousands of vehicles and forced travellers onto perilous alternative routes.
The situation remains dire in the eastern areas of Jalalpur Pirwala, where villages, including Noraja Bhutta, Basti Lang, Kotla Chakar, Bahadurpur, Mouza Kanu, Kandeer, Jhaiyu, Deepal, Tarut Basharat, Daily Rajanpur, Belaywala, Dunyapur, Jhangra, Muradpur Soiwala and Sabra are surrounded by eight to 10 feet of stagnant water. The relentless pressure has caused widespread destruction of homes and property.
Meanwhile, as the Punjab government earlier this week
launched
a survey to assess the losses caused by recent floods, the PPP
urged
PM Shehbaz to accept its demand for providing immediate relief to the flood-affected people through the Benazir Income Support Programme. The PML-N and the PPP — coalition partners at the Centre and in Punjab — have been at
odds
over how to help the flood victims, with the former’s government in Punjab insisting on using its own resources, while the latter is adamant about using BISP.
Punjab Minister for Irrigation Kazim Ali Pirzada said on Sunday that three out of seven breaches at the Noraja Bhutta embankment on the Sutlej River were plugged completely and they were carrying the work to plug two more breaches. He said that the largest breach was 3,300 feet wide, which, according to the latest updates, was reduced to 1,650 feet.
The minister said that the Irrigation Department was utilising all its capabilities and resources to ensure that the remaining breaches should be completely plugged by the evening of Oct 4.
He further stated that the water level in the area is gradually receding. A team of experts will conduct another technical review of the situation on Oct 6 to better plan future measures.
Earlier, Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said that the rehabilitation and relief activities for flood victims have been formally initiated. He said that as the river situation has normalised, affected people have started returning to their homes, while the administration continues to provide dry rations in the affected areas.
China sends relief flights
Two Chinese relief flights carrying 300 tents and 9,000 blankets landed at Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi on Sunday for families displaced by the floods.
Federal Minister Engr Amir Muqam, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik, Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong and officials from the Foreign Office and NDMA received the consignment.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Muqam thanked China for the timely assistance and said that China’s contribution is not only a humanitarian endeavour but also a reaffirmation of the everlasting Pakistan-China friendship.

rape and forced abortion
of a Grade 10 student.
The student, a resident of Khayaban-i-Sir Syed of Rawalpindi’s Pirwadhai town, had lodged a first information report (FIR) with the police on Monday under Sections 338A (punishment  for  Isqat-i-haml) and 376i (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code, alleging that her academy’s principal raped her multiple times and forced her to have an abortion.
In her complaint, the victim alleged that the principal, who was childless, had offered to marry her while she was studying in Grade 10. She reportedly told him to approach her parents regarding the matter.
She further said that the principal started coming closer to her and assured her that he would help her get good marks in the matriculation examination, convincing her to have physical relations with him.
The complainant claimed that the man called her into his office and raped her. After a few months, she informed him that she was pregnant, but instead of marrying her, he gave her medicine for an abortion.
As per the FIR, the victim alleged that the suspect continued raping her from time to time and again made her pregnant. However, when she insisted on marriage, he refused and began subjecting her to torture.
A statement by the police on X quoted Rawalpindi Superintendent of Police Rawal Arshad as saying that the force took swift action and arrested the suspect, adding that the victim’s medical examination had also been initiated.
SP Arshad said a challan would be filed in court with solid evidence to ensure an exemplary punishment for the suspect.  and real punishment will be ensured. “Violence, abuse or harassment against women and children is unacceptable,” he said.
Human Rights Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar earlier ordered an “immediate and transparent” investigation into the incident, according to a statement issued today by Tarar’s office.
The minister ordered the suspect’s immediate arrest and sought a report on the incident. “The provision of justice to the affected student should be ensured under all circumstances,” Tarar, who is also the law minister, was quoted as saying.
According to Section 376 of the
Pakistan Penal Code
, the punishment for rape can be a death sentence or
imprisonment
of not less than 10 years and not more than 25 years, or the remainder of the convict’s life, along with a fine.
In May, a sessions court in Rawalpindi
sentenced
a man to death for raping a woman under Section 17 of the Anti-Rape (Investigation & Trial) Act, 2021.
Rape laws in Pakistan have seen significant reforms, particularly with the
Anti-Rape Ordinance 2020
, which introduced special courts for expedited trials, mandated medico-legal examinations within six hours, and established a national sex offender registry.
However, systemic challenges persist, with the national level conviction rate for rape at a mere
0.5 per cent
, according to a report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO).
National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) Chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha said last month that
only 41pc
of the women raped report it, and even out of those, many back off due to societal pressure.
Last month, the interior ministry reported that
200 of the 567 cases
of sexual abuse registered in Islamabad between 2021 and June 2025 involved children.
In June, Rawalpindi police said they had
arrested
an Adiala jail employee who allegedly raped his 11-year-old niece in the prison’s residential colony.
The same month, a woman in the district’s Dhamial area

The police have arrested the suspect and registered a murder case against him. Initially, the accused claimed the incident was caused by a compressor explosion, but after the police launched an investigation, it was revealed that the woman had been set on fire two days earlier in Dhamial.
Upon receiving information about the incident, City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Hamdani took notice and ordered the immediate registration of a case and the arrest of the accused. The brother-in-law of the deceased woman has been arrested, and a murder charge has been added to the report as further investigation continues.
Mohammad Shahzad Ahmad Bhatti, 23, a resident of Quaid-i-Azam Colony in Dhamial, filed an FIR with the police, stating that he was at work when he received a call from his uncle, who informed him that his mother had been burnt due to a compressor explosion.
His uncle told him to rush home, as she had been taken to CMH. When Shahzad arrived at the hospital, he found his mother in the emergency ward, badly burnt and unconscious.
In the FIR, Shahzad further stated that his sister told him that their aunt, Hajra Adeel, had argued with both her and their mother, Shahzia Farooq. Hajra had allegedly threatened to kill them, then kicked his sister out of the house and locked the door.
Shahzad said that his sister’s screams attracted the attention of neighbors, who came to her aid and unlocked the door. When they entered the house, they found his mother engulfed in flames, while Hajra Adeel was reportedly changing clothes.
Shahzad added that when his sister asked Hajra how their mother had been burnt, she claimed it was due to a compressor explosion.
Shahzad said he was certain that his aunt, Hajra Adeel, had intentionally set his mother on fire in an attempt to murder her.
He said the motive behind the incident was domestic unrest, as his father managed the daily affairs and expenses of the household, often leading to quarrels between his parents and his aunt over financial issues.
According to initial police investigations, the woman was doused with kerosene and set on fire. Further investigations are ongoing.
CPO Syed Khalid Hamdani condemned the crime, stating that crimes against women would not be tolerated and that the accused would be punished to the fullest extent of the law.

On Sunday, some unidentified persons broke the door of the officer’s office, held the security personnel hostage and switched off the CCTV cameras at early hours on Sunday. They took the chair of ADCG Irfan Anwar and put it on the public walking track of the Town Hall in front of Jinnah Hall. According to reports, they allegedly tortured the MC guard when he resisted.
The incident occurred a day after PML-N district general secretary/former MNA Mian Imtiaz Ahmed entered the office with two dozen town planners and the clash started between him and Irfan Anwar. The politician’s men broke the entrance door of the office.
The PML-N district general secretary was allegedly angry because Anwar didn’t reply to his repeated calls, which he made to stop the officer from demolishing and sealing the illegal
housing schemes
. But the ADCG refused to succumb to the political pressure from the ruling party’s office-bearer.
On Saturday evening, Mian Imtiaz Ahmed held a press conference at his home, demanding the arrest of the officer, alleging that he was involved in corruption and discrimination against traders. PML-N divisional vice president Khalid Shaheen and former MPA Mehmood ul Hassan Cheema were also present.

He said that on Aug 14 and 15 this year, when the sewerage was handed over to the Water and Sewerage Authority (Wasa), Mr Anwar passed the bills worth Rs10m in a single night.
He alleged that the officer had spent more than Rs10m on renovation of his house and he was getting petrol worth Rs700,000 per month for his official vehicle. He also alleged that Mr Anwar had received Rs0.7m from Virsa Furniture on Club Road and Rs200,000 from a beauty parlour near Apwa Ladies Club.
The politician said the ADCG also extorted Rs11.1m from Abdul Maalik who runs a shop in Businessman Colony and Rs300,000 from a fast food business.
Mian Imtiaz alleged that Anwar was receiving Rs10m from different housing schemes each and added that the officer was registering illegal first information reports (FIRs) against town planners.
According to municipal committee (MC) sources, before Mian Imtiaz Ahmed’s press conference, exchange of expletives had happened between Ahmed and Anwar when the former went to the latter’s office, accompanied by about 80 men. Both the officer and MNA leader allegedly slapped each other after exchange of harsh words.

He also urged parents and young girls to come forward and get vaccinated against cervical cancer. He said the vaccine was scientifically proven, tested and in use across the globe.
It is worth mentioning that Dr Jan, during his tenure as caretaker health minister, initiated efforts to introduce the HPV vaccine and engaged the international vaccine alliance Gavi.
“It is great that finally our efforts and struggle have paid off. The plant we had sown at the cost of our seat and pains has started bearing fruit, as the HPV vaccine has been launched,” he said.
“Mindful of the resistance in some areas, it would have been better to have risk-mapped the areas with refusals or hesitation to routine immunisation, and communication and engagement activities should have been undertaken to remove any misgivings. A blanket start could imperil future gains in our quest to ensure 90 per cent coverage. We should encourage modelling this vaccination through our kin, influential figures’ children, and social media activists,” Dr Jan suggested.
Meanwhile, Federal Health Minister Mustafa Kamal met a Gavi mission to discuss the progress of the HPV vaccination campaign and future immunisation plans.
The Gavi mission was led by Thabani Maphosa, Chief Country Delivery Officer at Gavi, in the context of the ongoing HPV vaccination campaign against cervical cancer.
The health minister expressed satisfaction with the launch of the campaign. He emphasised the importance of maintaining momentum to ensure equitable access to lifesaving vaccines for all eligible girls across the country.
Priority areas and guidelines identified by the minister included holding regular press briefings, drawing on global experiences and best practices, integrating efforts with the Ministry of Education, and managing feedback through helpline 1166, among others.
Mustafa Kamal also requested support from the visiting Gavi mission members for the introduction of the Hexavalent vaccine and the advancement of indigenous vaccine production in Pakistan.
The health minister reaffirmed that the HPV vaccination drive would serve as a milestone in reducing the burden of cervical cancer and ensuring a healthier future for the nation.

Cholistan canals project
, saying the water that would have been diverted towards the desert belonged to her province.
“If Punjab wants construct canals for its water, why are you bothered? It is Punjab’s water. It belongs to the people, farmers and fields of Punjab,” she said at the inauguration ceremony of an electric bus service in Faisalabad.
“If I want to create canals, why do you object to it?” she questioned. “I wouldn’t have stolen water. I would have [used] them to create waterways and developed Cholistan,” she continued, taking a fresh jibe at her party’s coalition partner in the Centre.
The now-shelved canals project had turned out to be a
cause of contention
between the Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively.
The project aimed to irrigate a total of 4.8 million acres of barren land by constructing six canals — two each in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab. Five of those canals would have been built on the Indus River, while the sixth would have been constructed along the Sutlej River, supplying approximately 4,120 cusecs of water to irrigate the Cholistan desert in Punjab.
Maryam and Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir had
inaugurated
the project to irrigate south Punjab’s lands on February 15 amid public uproar and strong
reservations
in Sindh. What was being hailed as a game-changer for Punjab had triggered an uproar in Sindh, which believed the scheme would have further disturb the ecological balance in the province and deprived it of its mandated water share.
After months of
protests
from various fragments of society as well as
opposition from Sindh
, the federal government had
announced
on April 23 that it was halting the project until a consensus on the issue could be reached in the Council of Common Interests — a key body tasked with resolving power-sharing disputes between the federal and provincial governments. The decision came amid uncertainty created by India’s
unilateral suspension
of the Indus Waters Treaty.
Then, on April 28, CCI meeting had
endorsed
the federal government’s move to halt the initiative until “mutual understanding” could be achieved among provinces.
As Maryam resurrected the issue during her speech again, the Punjab CM mentioned flood relief and the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) — the latest cause of
dispute
between the PPP and PML-N over flood relief.
The PPP and PML-N have lately been arguing over the means for flood relief, with the PPP insisting on the use of BISP and the PML-N disapproving the proposition.
Reiterating her argument that funds given under the BISP were insufficient for flood relief, she, once again rejected the PPP’s proposition to seek international assistance to help people affected by recent floods in Punjab.
“Keep your advice to yourself,” she rebuked, adding the seeking international help was not the only solution.
“Punjab never interferes in your matters, so you don’t interfere in Punjab’s matters,” she said.",2025-09-29,Dawn.com,773,0.000118

• Judicial officers asked to exercise caution in accepting friend requests
• Curbs aim to ensure impartiality, dignity and independence of judiciary
KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) has issued guidelines for district judges, judicial officers and their staff on the use of social media in order to uphold the highest standards of judicial conduct and ethics.
SHC’s Member Inspection Team (MIT-I) Haleem Ahmed issued a letter to district and sessions judges as well as judicial officers across the province, stating that Chief Justice Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar had expressed deep concerns about continued violations of earlier standard operating procedures (SOPs), issued in 2022 by the SHC, on the subject matter.
Thereafter, it said that the chief justice had issued additional SOPs/guidelines for strict compliance and stated that any violation of such instructions would be deemed misconduct and result in disciplinary proceedings.
The letter also stated that all judicial officers and staff were required to observe decorum, impartiality and objectivity at all public and private forums, including social media platforms, and that the use of such media must not undermine the basic code of conduct and dignity of the judiciary.
It said: “Judicial officers and staff must not use their official titles, designations, or status to promote personal, political or business interests on social media. Official or court-created digital groups (e.g. WhatsApp, Telegram) must only be used for their defined, work-related purposes.”
“In order to maintain their impartiality and objectivity in performance, they shall not partake in any discussion on social media or exchange or forward information or messages that express their opinion on political issues or similar matters,” it added.
“Judicial officers and staff must exercise utmost caution in accepting friend or contact requests, particularly from lawyers, litigants, or persons who may appear before the court, to avoid perceptions or risks of conflict of interest,” it added.
The MIT-I in his letter also said that no comments or posts be made on pending or decided cases, or any policy matters of the judiciary, on any social media or digital platform, and that judges as well as staff must not express political, sectarian or caste-based views or statements on social media forums.
The letter also asked judicial officers and staff not to comment on, disclose, or discuss any official correspondence, document, order or proceedings of the court or the high court on any social media platform, or share confidential information without prior approval of the competent authority.
Disparaging, derogatory, or disrespectful remarks aimed at any individual, group, sect, faith or office are strictly prohibited and shall render the person liable to disciplinary action, it added.
It also asked the judges and court staff not to engage in unauthorised discourse of official information or share official documents or any other information they come across during the course of performing their duties via social media.
It further directed them not to participate in the furthering of any information, especially pertaining to government matters, that prima facie appeared to be unauthentic and misleading.
“Judicial officers and staff must always uphold and demonstrate the highest standards of judicial conduct and ethics in all social media activity, refraining from any conduct – direct or indirect – that could compromise the dignity, independence, or impartiality expected of the judiciary,” it added.

Toshakhana case
against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi.
The judge concluded cross-examination of two key witnesses including an approver Sohaib Abbasi in over six-hour-long proceeding inside Adiala Jail in the case relating to alleged irregularities in retaining the expensive Bulgari Jewelry set from Toshakhana gifts.
Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjum­and presided over the trial, during which the defence team completed cross-examination of the two witnesses.
Private appraiser Sohaib Abbasi, who had submitted an affidavit in the case, and former prime minister’s personal secretary Inam Shah, were both questioned extensively by defence lawyers.
The court summoned two more witnesses — former prime minister’s military secretary Brig Muhammad Ahmed and deputy military secretary Col Rehan — to appear at the next hearing and record their statements.
During the proceedings, Mr Khan and his wife were produced before the special court, while his three sisters, along with defence counsel Barrister Ali Zafar, were present in courtroom.

ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the verdict that was reserved earlier today on Shahrez’s bail petition and ordered his release subject to paying a surety bond set at Rs100,000. Shahrez’s lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassar, confirmed the development to
Dawn.com
and PTI lawyer Taimur Malik also said the same.
Lahore Police had
picked up
Shahrez, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from his mother’s Lahore residence on August 21. His brother Shershah Khan was also arrested the next day over similar allegations, and sent on physical remand and then to jail.
Shahrez was sent on 14-day judicial remand by the Lahore ATC on August 30.
During today’s hearing on Shahrez’s bail petition, Advocate Mudassar argued that the athlete was accused of inciting party workers, adding that the investigation was approached from multiple angles, with geo-fencing carried out as well, and yet no evidence was found against Imran’s nephew.
“Everything is clear in the challan, it mentions named and unnamed suspects but Shahrez is not mentioned at all, no investigator gave any statement. He was arrested after 28 months and his mother — the PTI founder’s sister —  is raising her voice for his release. This arrest was made to suppress their voice,” he said.
The lawyer argued that Shahrez was in Chitral during the riots and several people had submitted affidavits in this regard. He said the athlete was also due to go abroad to compete in a sporting event.
Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed their concerns over the arrests, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
Shahrez’s wife has said her husband was in Chitral with her family on May 9, 2023, sharing purported pictures from the trip. At the same time, the PTI had challenged a video being shared of Shahrez, stating it was from the party’s public meeting in Kahna held on Sept 21, 2024, not from the 2023 riots.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.",2025-09-03,Rana Bilal,688,0.000112

influencer
Samiya Hijab, to jail for 14 days on judicial remand.
The suspect was
arrested
on September 2 and a case was registered in the capital’s Shalimar Police Station at her complaint under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 392 (punishment for robbery), 500 (punishment for defamation), 509 and 511 of the Pakistan Penal Code.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941101/judges-should-be-cautious-when-sharing-grievances-publicly-tarar,Judges should be cautious when sharing grievances publicly: Tarar - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar issued a word of caution on Wednesday, urging Supreme Court judges to raise internal grievances within private forums — such as tea rooms, the Chief Justice’s chambers, or committee rooms — instead of expressing them publicly through
letters
.
“In view of the sensitivities attached to the highest institution like the judiciary, it is my humble request to all honourable judges that the best forums for expressing grievances are their tea rooms, the chambers of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, or the committee rooms,” he said.
This marked the minister’s first response to a recent series of letters written by several Supreme Court judges — a development he termed “unfortunate” and part of a troubling trend that has emerged in recent months.
Speaking informally to the media after attending a ceremony outside the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Islamabad, the law minister recalled that even during the New Judicial Year ceremony earlier in the week, apex legal bodies such as the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association had advised judges to resolve such issues privately rather than through public correspondence.
“This is not in the interest of the judiciary, as such tendencies erode the dignity and reputation of the top court,” he remarked.
He added that if the concerns raised in these letters were genuinely reflective of the internal situation, it was all the more reason to resolve them within institutional boundaries. “Bar councils have always been at the forefront when it comes to safeguarding the judiciary,” he noted, suggesting that lawyers’ bodies remain the appropriate avenue for internal accountability.
The minister’s comments come in the wake of a
recent letter
by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, along with Justices Munib Akhtar, Ayesha A. Malik, and Athar Minallah, criticizing the convening of Monday’s
full court meeting
to approve the new Supreme Court Rules 2025 as a mere “cosmetic exercise.”
“The convening of the full court at this stage is not only puzzling but also fallacious,” the judges wrote, alleging that the meeting was intended to give a “veneer of legitimacy to an otherwise invalid process.” In a prior letter, Justice Shah questioned whether the CJP was fostering judicial independence or seeking compliance to turn the court into a “regimented force.”
He expressed reluctance in writing the letter but felt compelled by what he described as an “unavoidable institutional duty.” “What compels me to write is your persistent and complete indifference,” he wrote, lamenting that his repe­ated letters and communications on crucial matters had gone unanswered.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942418/fake-degree-case-cj-dogar-led-ihc-bench-bars-justice-jahangiri-from-judicial-work,‘Fake’ degree case: CJ Dogar-led IHC bench bars Justice Jahangiri from judicial work - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"An Islamabad High Court (IHC) bench, led by Chief Justice (CJ) Sar­dar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Tariq Mah­mood Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the Supreme Judicial Council’s (SJC) decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree.
A
complaint
pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s allegedly fake degree was submitted to the SJC last year in July while a petition challenging his appointment was filed in the
IHC
earlier this year.
The matter centres on a
letter
that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
During the hearing today, apart from barring Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work, the bench also appointed lawyers Barrister Zafarullah Khan and Ashtar Ausaf as amici curiae.
Moreover, the bench also sought the attorney general’s assistance over the matter of the maintainability of the plea.
It ruled that the case would remain under adjournment until the SJC’s decision on the matter.
“The court has to consider an important question, that if a matter is under adjournment in the Supreme Judicial Council, can the high court be approached on it,” the bench observed.
At one point in the hearing, Raja Aleem Abbasi, who was representing the Islamabad Bar Association, remarked, “We believe in the rule of law.” He added that bar associations were also stakeholders in the matter.
CJ Dogar observed during the hearing that anyone had the right to hearing and the court had to consider the objections on the petition by the registrar’s office.
For his part, counsel Abbasi pleaded that if the practice of filing such cases turned into trend, it could be “dangerous”. He argued that objections on the petition should be upheld.
The court concluded the hearing after ruling that Justice Jahangiri should be barred from judicial work until the SJC’s decision.
Following that, the IHC also issued a revised duty roster for the judges, which is seen by
Dawn.com
and does not show Justice Jahangiri being a part of any bench.
The petition
The
petition
against Justice Jahangiri, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeks a writ of quo warranto (by what authority) against him, arguing that his foundational qualification for judicial office — an LLB degree from the University of Karachi — is “invalid”, thereby rendering his entire legal career and subsequent appointment illegitimate.
The petitioner has bas­ed his case on official correspondence from the Uni­versity of Karachi, which is attached as evidence with the plea.
The key allegations in the petition include the use of dual enrollment numbers, as the record shows
two different enrollment
numbers for Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I and Part-II examinations. The University of Karachi has previously stated that it is “impossible to allot two enrollment numbers to a student for one programme”.
The enrollment number AIL-5968/87, which appears on Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I mark sheet, was officially allocated by the university to another individual, Imtiaz Ahmad, son of Muhammad Ellahi, according to the petition.
Furthermore, the principal of Government Islamia Law College, Karachi, stated in a letter that a student named “Tariq Mehmood s/o Qazi Muhammad Akram”, under enrollment number AIL-7124/87, was never admitted to the college for the LLB programme during the relevant period, the petition read.
It further stated that the controller of examinations at KU concluded in an official letter that the degree and mark sheets in question were “invalid”.
The petition argued that the appointment of a judge without the requisite legal qualification is not just an administrative error, but a violation of the fundamental rights of all citizens.
The petitioner has contended that the presence of a judge with an allegedly invalid degree “shakes public confidence” and “tarnishes the image of the judiciary as a neutral arbiter”.
It may be recalled that Justice Jahangiri is one of the five judges who
challenged
the transfer of Justice Dogar, along with two other judges —Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Asif — to the IHC.
He was also among the cohort that, last year, wrote a
letter
to the Supreme Judicial Council, alleging interference by intelligence agencies in the judicial matters.
Days before the controversy over his degree initially surfaced, Justice Jahangiri was expeditiously hearing election petitions against alleged rigging in all three constituencies of Islamabad.",2025-09-16,Tahir Naseer,1144,0.000146

PAC Chairman Nisar Ahmad Khuhro, who is also the PPP’s Sindh president, warned that local councils would face accountability if they failed to utilise tax money for public welfare.
“Why should the Sindh government bear the burden of blame?” he questioned, pointing out that the provincial government allocated Rs168 billion annually to these bodies for the people’s welfare.
The PAC meeting reviewed the audit reports of the local councils of Sukkur Division for the years 2022 and 2023.
Khuhro says local councils spend less than 30pc of funds on development works
The committee expressed concern over the performance of all local councils, including UCs, town and municipal committees, and municipal corporations across the province, and sought a monthly report on the use of Octroi Zilla Tax (OZT) funds from all local councils.
The PAC, which reviews financial records of government departments to detect irregularities and enhance transparency in governance, also directed the provincial finance department and the LG department not to release OZT funds to local councils that did not submit monthly reports on the use of the funds.
Mr Khuhro said that the Sindh government was providing Rs168bn annually to local councils across the province as OZT, but nothing was known about where and how the local councils were spending this money.
He said that the released OZT funds included a development budget of Rs80bn. “However, local councils are not spending even 30 per cent of the Rs168bn OZT funds on development works, due to which the public is raising questions about their performance,” he added.
“Municipal corporations are being provided with Rs100m to Rs120m per month, municipal and town committees with Rs20m to Rs25m per month, and UCs with Rs1m to Rs1.2m per month. However, the local councils are not reporting the use of the funds to anyone. The local councils will have to be accountable,” he snapped.
The PAC ordered the regional directors of the LG department to inspect the local councils of their respective divisions.
It also directed the LG department to computerise the records of employees of all local councils across Sindh and to conduct biometrics of employees.
The PAC further ordered the suspension of the chief municipal officer of the Gambat Municipal Committee for not depositing Rs7m in sales tax into the government treasury.

On Wednesday, the government
signed
loan facilities worth approximately Rs1.225tr with 18 banks to settle the outstanding dues of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) parked in circular debt. These dues will be serviced through a Rs3.23 per unit surcharge on consumers for a period of six years.
The signing ceremony was held at the PM Office, witnessed virtually by the prime minister from New York. No official announcement was made, although ministers confirmed the signing of the agreement. Under the agreement, the government will have 30 days to request disbursements from banks for prompt utilisation to avoid penalties.
Today, the ceremony was aired on television, with both the premier and the finance minister addressing the gathering.
In his remarks, Aurangzeb said that facility “resolves the structural issues of the power sector”.
“Ultimately, it’s all for the benefit of Pakistan and the benefit of the consumers,” he said, branding it a “win-win situation”.
Lauding the efforts of the authorities involved in arranging the loan facility, the finance minister remarked, “This is a very important step in reducing the energy equation.”
Echoing the minister’s thoughts, PM Shehbaz termed the facility a “huge success”, remarking that “circular debt was eating up all our resources”.
The premier noted that negotiating with IPPs was a “big challenge”, but the team “lived up to their responsibility at the right time.”
He also thanked Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir for his “behind-the-scenes support”. Outlining future steps, PM Shehbaz said that the power sector’s next targets included privatisation of power distribution companies and dealing with line losses.
“These are big challenges that we have to take on with faith,” he added.
Speaking at the ceremony, Power Minister Awais Leghari called the move a “bold step”, pointing out that “circular debt has burdened the energy sector for a long time”.
“The circular debt financing scheme is another landmark initiative to restore the health of our power sector,” Leghari added.
‘A major breakthrough’
Separately, in a press release issued by the Ministry of Finance on Thursday, Aurangzeb called the agreement a step towards “restoring fiscal discipline, investor confidence, and energy sector sustainability”.
The success of the agreement “sets a precedent for addressing Pakistan’s structural challenges with innovation, unity and resolve,” the press release quoted him as saying.
The finance minister, in the statement, maintained that “release of Rs660 billion in sovereign guarantees through this arrangement will channel much-needed liquidity into priority sectors such as agriculture, small and medium enterprises, housing, education, and healthcare”.
In its statement, the ministry hailed the “historic joint effort”, calling it a “major breakthrough in addressing one of the most chronic challenges of Pakistan’s energy sector”.
Under the facility, the servicing of the Rs1.225tr debt would be serviced through a Debt Service Surcharge (DSS) at the rate of Rs3.23 per unit. Of this, Rs659bn would be used for loans payable by Power Holding Ltd (PHL) — a shell subsidiary of the Power Division.
The remaining funds — 556bn — would be used to pay dues to IPPs, petroleum sector entities, and make subsidy adjustments, including through book adjustments and cash settlements.
The Ministry of Finance facilitated the loan agreements with 18 banks, including Habib Bank, Meezan Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, Allied Bank Ltd, United Bank Ltd, Faysal Bank Ltd, Bank Al Habib Ltd, MCB Bank Ltd, Bank Alfalah, Dubai Islamic Bank, Bank of Punjab, BankIslami Pakistan, Askari Bank Ltd, Habib Metropolitan Bank, Al Baraka Bank Ltd, Bank of Khyber, MCB Islamic Bank and Soneri Bank.
Amid little reform and a stock of over Rs4.6tr
circular debt
, Pakistan’s energy sector continues to weigh heavily on its economy across all sectors, owing to weak collections, theft, poor infrastructure, governance problems, and market inefficiencies.
According to the Washington-based Institute of International Finance (IIF), “there is about 4pc of GDP worth of debt stemming from the energy sector. The repercussion of this debt reverberates throughout the economy, not only impacting the fiscal but also growth, inflation, the external balance, and the financial sector.”
It said circular debt and energy subsidies added significant pressure to public finances, contributing to persistent fiscal imbalances and forcing the government to allocate resources away from other investments, social programmes, and infrastructure projects, and crowding out the private sector.",2025-09-25,Dawn.com,1210,0.000151

He said this while chairing a meeting called to review the Provincial Action Plan against
terrorism
, according to a statement.
Mr Shah said that the situation in Bajaur and Dir districts was brought under control through strong community backing, thereby avoiding collateral damage.
He, however, pointed out that there were challenges in a few southern and merged tribal districts and they must be addressed through stronger administrative and public trust-building measures.
The chief secretary also stressed the need for a “whole-of-system approach” for effective PAP implementation.He said that terrorism could be addressed by law-enforcement agencies alone.
Says community-driven development vital for sustaining peace
Mr Shah said that the civil society and institutions should also support the national cause, especially in eliminating the terrorists’ support structures.
He directed all departments and field formations to identify and neutralise such support systems without delay.
The chief secretary said that the strengthening of the police force and the establishment of effective security mechanisms over the last year had significantly enhanced the province’s ability to respond to security threats.
“With the effective implementation of PAP, we are confident that peace and stability will be restored across the province,” he said.
Mr Shah emphasised that maintaining law and order remained the top priority of the provincial government.
“Significant resources and public funds have been allocated to strengthen police, enhance safe city initiatives and improve security infrastructure,” he said.
The chief secretary also directed relevant institutions to expedite the execution of development projects in vulnerable areas, saying that community-driven development is vital for sustaining peace.
He highlighted the urgent need to improve road infrastructure to ensure functional trade routes and called for greater investment in youth skill development and employment generation.
The meeting was attended by additional chief secretary (home) Mohammad Abid Majeed, senior member of the Board of Revenue Mohammad Javed Marwat, administrative secretaries, police officials, representatives of law-enforcement agencies, Anti-Narcotics Force and other provincial and federal institutions. Commissioners, regional police officers, deputy commissioners and district police officers also joined it via video link.
The meeting reviewed the progress on PAP implementation by provincial departments, divisional and district administrations, LEAs and federal institutions. The ACS (home) gave a briefing on it. There followed in-depth discussions on challenges, gaps and practical suggestions for improving the PAP’s execution.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945032/sho-among-six-injured-as-protest-against-childs-murder-turns-violent-in-ajks-kotli-district,SHO among six injured as protest against child’s murder turns violent in AJK’s Kotli district - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"MUZAFFARABAD: At least five police personnel, including an SHO and a woman constable, and one demonstrator were injured on Saturday when a protest against the murder of a six-year-old girl turned violent in Khuiratta, in the southern Kotli district of Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
The clash erupted after protesters, staging a two-day sit-in at a busy roundabout on the call of Tehreek-i-Labbaik leader and former assembly candidate Arslan Ghazi, blocked all entry and exit routes of the border town early in the morning.
The demonstrators, including women—some carrying infants—held placards and banners and chanted slogans against the police and administration, accusing them of “failing to dispense justice to the victim’s family”.
When the administration attempted to reopen the roads, police took one activist, Kamran, into custody and summoned Mr Ghazi for talks. Protesters assumed he too had been detained and, in anger, pelted stones at the police station, to get him released.
Police responded with firing in the air, tear gas, and baton charges.
Police said the clash left SHO Raja Sadaqat Hussain, head constable Shahzad Ahmed, constables Rafaqat Hussain and Shah Nawaz Hussain, lady constable Saaila Kanwal, and an 18-year-old demonstrator, Arman Adnan, injured.
The agitation stemmed from public dissatisfaction with multiple inquiries into the brutal killing of Tasmiya Sohail, the six-year-old girl who went missing on July 29 and whose “chemically mutilated” body was recovered three days later from a field near her home.
The victim’s family belongs to the Rajput tribe.
Police initially suspected Mumtaz Shah, a resident of Faisalabad employed by former police constable Chaudhry Faisal Mushtaq to look after livestock, as the culprit since he had left for his hometown in the early hours of July 30.
He was arrested the following day with the help of his employer, who belongs to the Jat tribe and had also served as a gunman for AJK Health Minister and Khuiratta MLA Nisar Ansar Abdali.
According to police sources, Shah confessed during interrogation to raping and killing the child “under the influence of Satan” and led them to the recovery of her clothes, shoes, and the chemicals used on her body.
However, reportedly, the initial medical examination did not confirm rape because the body had been reduced to a bony structure. A conclusive opinion was still awaited from forensic experts.
In a video statement recorded in custody, Shah alleged that his employer and the employer’s nephew had instigated him to commit the crime.
On the family’s demand, an inquiry was conducted under SSP Kotli Adeel Ahmed Langrial, which held Shah responsible for the murder. But relatives and locals rejected the findings, alleging that crucial facts had been suppressed.
A second team, led by SP Nadeem Arif with two DSPs among its members, also blamed Shah. Again, the family dismissed the outcome, demanding the inclusion of intelligence agency representatives.
The government then constituted a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) under SP Khurram Iqbal with agency participation, but the family objected, insisting it should be led by a DIG.
The parents even held press conferences in Islamabad and Muzaffarabad to press their demand.
True to its tradition of acting only after situations escalate, the government appointed DIG Yasin Qureshi as head of a new five-member JIT — also including representatives of ISI and IB — on Friday afternoon, when the protest sit-in had already entered its second day.”
The committee was authorised to co-opt any B-17 officer from the Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory and the Federal Investigation Agency for assistance and directed to submit its report within 10 days.
However, because the notification did not include a representative of Military Intelligence, protesters continued their sit-in on Saturday, which paralysed life in the town.
Although police had reinforced their ranks in anticipation of unrest, residents said that by evening the situation was gradually returning to normal. Still, the sit-in continued, keeping the road to Kotli city blocked.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941635,Unaccountable Big Brother - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"TWO revelations this week have highlighted the gaps in privacy rights and data protection in Pakistan.
One is the news that the personal and sensitive data of millions of Pakistanis is being
sold publicly
for a small amount, including that of the interior minister! Second is an
investigative report
by Amnesty International detailing the expansive technology-enabled state surveillance in Pakistan. The common thread between the two revelations is that they are both illegal and violate the fundamental rights of dignity and privacy in Pakistan.
The leaks of personal data that can be bought online include national identity card details, passport data, travel history, location etc. This is extremely alarming, as apart from privacy, this is a security failure. This can enable criminal activity, blackmail, fraud and even worse occurrences against anyone. How is sensitive personal data that citizens are forced to trust the state with so easily accessible?
What are the privacy and data protection protocols at Nadra, FIA, telecom companies and other government institutions that store this data? Why is it not stored in encrypted form with limited authorised access? And what consequences will those who sold this data in the black market face — especially the ones who enabled these leaks from the government databases?
Similarly, the Amnesty report details the level of mass surveillance that the state is carrying out. Citizens’ phones and computers can be turned into listening devices; conversations, emails and location data can be accessed without oversight or judicial authorisation, and there is no legal redress for those targeted.
Though the
audio leaks case
in the Islamabad High Court brought to the fore the
Lawful Intercept Management System
(LIMS) that snoops on citizens’ phone conversations, the Amnesty report tells us that the technology was developed by a German company, Utimaco, and supplied thr­ough a UAE company called Datafusion.
The
Web Monitoring System
(WMS) was supplied by a Canadian company Sandvine (now AppLogic Network) in 2018, but has been replaced by “new technology from China-based Geedge Networks, utilising hardware and software components supplied by Niagara Networks from the US and Thales from France … to create a new version of the firewall”.
The state’s surveillance certainly has a chilling effect.
These details show how a sophisticated system — which resulted in slower internet speeds by almost 40 per cent in 2024 and grave economic losses — acquired from multiple countries has created these illegal and unconstitutional surveillance systems in Pakistan.
The report details that LIMS is mandated by the Pakistan Tele­communications Authority (PTA) to be installed across telecommunication networks by private companies, allowing security and intel forces “to tap into it and access consumer data”. The report further details that the WMS also “allows authorities to block VPNs or any website deemed to be ‘unlawful’ content by the authorities”, showing the technical and logical link between surveillance and censorship.
This surveillance certainly has a chilling effect, as it is used to target political opposition, activists, journalists, and anybody the state deems worthy of snooping on, with complete impunity. The frequent incidents of financial scams and frauds that citizens have been reporting further prove the leaks of data that have become routine, and there seems to be little redress for these crimes once financial fraud has occurred against citizens.
The
National Cybe­rcrime Investigation Authority
must play its role of spreading awareness but also ensure that culprits of financial fraud are punished in order to deter such common practices of fraud. The PTA must ensure that no surveillance system is misused against citizens as LIMS is reported to be doing, and PTA’s licensees must also respect the laws and the Constitution rather than becoming accomplice in mass surveillance.
Whereas the state carries out surveillance under its perceived notions of security, the lack of legal cover for these invasive surveillance systems and the leaks of data that make personal details into a market commodity show how insecure and unsafe these systems really are.
A
data protection law
is a fundamental necessity to govern the right to privacy of Pakistanis that is afforded under Article 14 of the Constitution, and further expanded by several precedents in the superior judiciary, such as in the Benazir Bhutto case in 1988, the Ghulam Hussain case in 2010 and the Justice Qazi Faez Isa case in 2024. The Fair Trial Act, 2013, permits digital surveillance only after a warrant from a magistrate is granted; not the kind of mass surveillance that we are experiencing now.
The Amnesty report also highlights the violation of United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights which require both states and companies to respect human rights, including in their exports. The sale of spyware and surveillance technology shows how states such as the US, France, Canada, the UAE and China violate these principles by allowing export of technology that carries out mass surveillance with no regard for citizens’ fundamental rights.
As the Amnesty report recommends, there is a dire need for a comprehensive legal framework that regulates surveillance to ensure that it is targeted and proportionate, and subject to independent oversight. Parliament must play its role in conducting a transparent inquiry into the illegal surveillance systems in Pakistan, and legislate to regulate this industry under its oversight. Parliament must also move forward on the
Personal Data Protection draft
that has been debated since 2020 but has not yet reached a stage where it can be enacted.
The leaks will also have a dire impact on the business community, which could, instead, have benefited from a strong data protection regime that, in turn, would have encouraged more foreign investment in the IT sector, as well as enabled the security of the vast amounts of data stored and processed by businesses, organisations, hospitals and educational institutes.
A state that surveils without oversight and leaks without consequence erodes the trust of its citizens. The security of citizens must be paramount for the state. And a
post-26th Amendment
judiciary must act to safeguard citizens’ rights if it is serious about disproving allegations of being controlled by the executive.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942032,HPV vaccination of 2.5 million out-of-school girls a daunting task - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: Vaccination of 2.5m out-of-school girls after the floods and rains, especially in marginalised communities, could be challenging for the health teams as Punjab looks to introduce human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in routine immunisation programme following a campaign starting from Sept 15 to 27.
Vaccination is part of larger global strategy for elimination of cervical cancer and Pakistan is also a signatory of the 71stWorld Health Assembly Resolution of 2018 that sets a goal of 90-70-90 by year 2030, which means 90pc of girls vaccinated against HPV by age 15, 70pc of women screened by age 35 and again by 45, and 90pc of women with cervical cancer disease receive treatment/palliative care.
The HPV vaccine is to be given as a series of shots and is a key way to prevent the third most common cancer in women in Pakistan.
A senior official told
Dawn
Punjab’s Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) has made preparations to reach out of school girls in its bid to introduce HPV vaccine in routine immunization for girls aged 9 to 14 years but vaccination of girls in flood-affected areas, nomadic settings, migrant populations, red light areas could pose a serious challenge.He said the overall target for the campaign is just over 8m girls across Punjab and around 5.5m are envisioned to be vaccinated in schools.
EPI prepares to reach out to 8m girls, including those in marginalised communities
However, reaching out to around 2.5m out-of-school girls remains a grey area largely due to the floods, which damaged the school infrastructure across Punjab.
Quoting some recent WHO reports, the official said that cervical cancer related to HPV infection is a serious public health concern in Pakistan.“It is the third most common cancer among women in the country and the second most common cancer among women aged 15 to 44 years,” he said.
This cancer mostly hits the population in low resource settings. This cancer is caused by a virus known as human papillomavirus (HPV) and it can silently progress into serious cancer.
Punjab EPI Director Dr Samra Khurram says that the challenge of HPV vaccine introduction is very different to what the programme encountered previously.
“A lot of girls are out of school. We have deployed 6,277 outreach teams and over 13,000 social mobilizers. We have developed separate plans for remote and underserved areas. Kit stations will be set up at residents of community notables, hujras and LHW houses.”
Dr Samra says mobile/special teams are being deployed for high-risk and underserved populations such as those in prisons, orphanages, fields, markets, transport hubs, & settlements. Civil society organizations have been taken on board to reach out to special communities.
She adds that the EPI provides vaccines against 12 diseases to children below five years of age. However, HPV addresses a different age group of 9 to 14 years. “There is injection fear and it is hard to impart complicated scientific information to such a young age group.”
Dr Samra Khurram said this vaccine has already been introduced in over 144 countries globally, including Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Lessons learnt from these countries have been considered before formation of operational planning, she said.
This will be a single-dose vaccine, to be administered by trained health workers, including vaccinators, lady health visitors (LHVs) and nurses.
It may be remembered the HPV vaccine was previously available at expensive private hospitals only and was quite costly. This is the first time in a decade this vaccine shall now be available free of cost.

NAROWAL: A local man has started charging people for helping them cross the rainwater drain of Baen on a boat in Narowal. The protective embankment and bridge over the drain at Bheko Chak had broken.
Thousands of people, including children and women, used to go to the towns of Noorkot, Narowal, and other areas every day by crossing the Baen bridge. The collapse of the bridge cut off the land connection of more than 40 villages including Fatehpur Afghan, Baramangah, Malikpur, Jagatpur and Kot Nainan with Noorkot.
The residents of these villages used this bridge to go to work, offices, shopping and hospitals. It was used by the students too. In absence of the bridge, the locals are facing difficulties in transportation.
Seeing an opportunity of business, Muhammad Munshi, a local man, has made a raft with the help of plastic drums and he is charging Rs30 per person to cross the rainwater drain Baen on the makeshift boat.
Local journalist Muhammad Waseem told
Dawn
that the rainwater drain Baen is 20 to 25 feet deep.
“The rainwater drain is flowing rapidly. Munshi is making the citizens cross the drain without life jackets. The makeshift water boat system is a big threat to the lives of citizens.”
He said the district administration should build a temporary bridge across the Baen drain with the help of the army to facilitate thousands of people. The road connecting the villages near to the border near Jassar on the Narowal-Shakargarh road has also been washed away by the flood.
Due to the road collapse, the land connection of the villages of Nangli, Doaba and Fassipur with Narowal has been cut off. Rescue 1122 water boats are being used to provide transportation facilities to the citizens. The high level flood in the Ravi River was also washed away at village Ransiwal at three places.
The land connection of eight border villages Chandianwali, Dudhewali, Basiwala, Chelewali, Qalandarabad and Ran has been cut off from Narowal. The flood relay created 15 to 20 feet deep holes on the road. The locals have made a temporary system by tying cots with ropes to cross the floodwater.
Muhammad Akbar and Fazal Mahmood told
Dawn
that a resident of our village had died at the District Headquarters Hospital Narowal during the high-level flood in the Ravi. They said that the body was lying in the hospital for four days due to the flood as the roads were broken.
Narowal Deputy Commissioner Syed Hassan Raza told
Dawn
the district administration was taking steps for the restoration of roads. He claimed that the flood victims were being provided with food, medicine, accommodation, electricity, clean drinking water, fodder for animals and medicine at the flood relief camps. He said the district administration was providing basic facilities to the flood victims on a priority basis by utilising all resources.

Iqbal Market SHO Sher Mohammed Sangi told
Dawn
that Sajjad Shaukat, 25, was standing outside his home along with his two children when two unidentified muggers riding on a motorcycle emerged there.
He said CCTV footage obtained by police showed that the victim was using his cell phone when one of the robbers got off and demanded his phone. As he put up resistance, the robber opened fire on him and rode away with his accomplice without snatching the cell phone.
Shaukat sustained critical bullet wounds and was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.
The CCTV footage, which also went viral on social media, showed that the deceased was carrying his infant son while another son was standing near him when the incident occurred.
West Zone DIG Irfan Ali Baloch ordered the suspension of the SHO concerned for failing to curb incidents of street crime in his jurisdiction.
Meanwhile, a 45-year-old man was shot dead on Sharea Faisal near Nursery on Monday, police said.
Tipu Sultan SHO Yasin Gujjar said Mohammed Zada was a labourer and the murder appeared to be an outcome of some personal enmity.
He said that the victim had left his native town in Dir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a year ago due to enmity and had been living in Karachi since then.

order
for the removal of retired Major-General Hafeezur Rehman from his post as the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority’s (PTA) chairperson.
The bench, comprising Justices Muhammad Asif and Inaam Ameen Minhas, had taken up Rehman’s intra-court appeal against the earlier ruling, issued by Justice Babar Sattar on Tuesday, which had ordered the PTA chief’s removal over his “illegal” appointment to the position.
In his order, on a plea filed by digital rights activist Usama Khilji in 2023, Justice Sattar had
ruled
that the creation of a post for Member (Administration) in the PTA, and the subsequent appointment of Rehman as PTA chairman, were “unconstitutional, illegal and void ab initio”.
His decision had been challenged by Rehman within hours of it being announced.
Today, Advocate Qasim Wadud appeared as the counsel for the PTA chairman, while Additional Attorney General (AAG) Salman Mansoor also presented his arguments.
At the outset of the hearing, Mansoor contended that “relief which was not even sought in the petition had been granted” in Justice Sattar’s order.
“Neither were the rules challenged nor was a notice issued to the attorney general. Issuing a notice to the attorney general was necessary,” he argued.
The AAG further argued that a request not sought in a petition could not be considered under
Article 199
(jurisdiction of high court) of the Constitution.
“The court itself stated that the entire argument was not complete yet,” Mansoor claimed.
Addressing the PTA chairman’s lawyer, Justice Asif remarked, “You were given enough opportunity.”
Wadud then came to the rostrum and said, “It was questioned in the writ petition that the appointment of PTA chairman could not be made [as] the vacancy was wrongly advertised.
“[But] the rules had been changed and the [federal] cabinet had given the approval, following which the appointment was made,” he contended.
“The rules had been amended on
March 25
, [2023], after which the petition was filed,” the counsel added.
The court subsequently suspended the previous IHC ruling that ordered the immediate removal of the PTA chairman.
Recruitment process ‘suffered fr­om malice in law’
The earlier judgement by Justice Sattar pointed out that the advertisement for the post, issued on March 28, 2023, had been published at a time when no such position legally existed. Later amendments to the PTA Appointment Rules in May 2023 were deemed insufficient to regularise the appointment process.
Justice Sattar observed that the recruitment process “suffered fr­om malice in law” and appeared to have been tailored to accommodate a specific individual. The prescription of a higher age limit of 61 years for the post, compared with 57 years for other members, was cit­ed as further proof of malafide intent.
The court had further held that the appointment of the retired army officer as PTA chairman without a transparent and objective selection process was “illegal, irrational and unsustainable in the eyes of law”.
The judge had ordered that the senior-most serving PTA member would temporarily assume the charge of the office of PTA chairman till such time as the federal government appointed a regular chairman.",2025-09-18,Tahir Naseer,817,0.000121

campaign
, which has been targeting 13 million girls aged 9 to 14, has so far achieved only 34 percent of its target, it was revealed on Wednesday.
So far, only 4.5 million girls out of the targeted 13 million have been vaccinated against the virus, which causes cervical cancer.
The update was shared with State Minister for National Health Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath, who visited the HPV vaccination site at Islamabad Model School for Girls (IMSG), G-6/1-3, to observe the public health effort.
The visit was organised by UNICEF in collaboration with the Federal Directorate of Immunisation (FDI).
The campaign, which
began
on 17 September, will conclude on 27 September.
Participants at the event included Dr Soofia Yunus, Director General of FDI; Dr Khurram Akram, Director (Technical), FDI Islamabad; Sharmeela Rasool, Deputy Country Representative, UNICEF Pakistan; Ellen Thon, Deputy WHO Representative, Pakistan; Dr Rashida Batool, District Health Officer; and Ms Mehreen Balooch, Assistant Commissioner ICT.
“This campaign is more than a vaccination drive — it is a promise of a healthier future for our daughters.
Every girl vaccinated is a life protected, a family safeguarded, and a future secured,” said Dr. Bharath.
He added, “Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer among women in Pakistan, with two out of three women diagnosed not surviving.
“The HPV vaccine is a safe, effective, and scientifically proven solution to prevent cervical cancer and save lives. Increasing HPV coverage among girls averts more deaths per person vaccinated than any other immunisation activity.”
A social media campaign was launched before the vaccination drive, but many parents refused to vaccinate their daughters.
Federal Health Minister Mustafa Kamal attempted to raise awareness by vaccinating his daughter in front of the media.
Reassuring parents, Dr Bharath stressed that the HPV vaccine was halal, endorsed by leading Islamic scholars, and already included in the national immunisation schedules of Muslim-majority countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Malaysia, Qatar, Bangladesh, and Indonesia.
“Protecting life (Hifz al-Nafs) is among the highest obligations in Islam. Shielding our daughters from a preventable disease is both a moral and religious duty,” he said.
Pakistan’s HPV vaccination campaign is aligned with the World Health Organisation’s Cervical Cancer Elimination Initiative, which seeks to ensure that 90 percent of girls worldwide are vaccinated against HPV by age 15 by 2030.
The campaign is being implemented in three phases: Phase 1, running from 15–27 September 2025, covers Punjab, Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Islamabad Capital Territory; Phase 2 will expand to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026; and Phase 3 will reach Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027.
The goal is to vaccinate 90 per cent of girls aged 9–14 in Phase 1 regions by the end of 2025, and to sustain high coverage through routine immunisation in the coming years.
“The HPV vaccine is safe, free, and available to every eligible girl. By protecting their health today, we are safeguarding their education, their future, and their ability to contribute to society. Let us keep this momentum going until every eligible girl is reached,” Dr Bharath said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942802/tax-on-feminine-hygiene-products-challenged-in-lhc,Tax on feminine hygiene products challenged in LHC - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"RAWALPINDI: The Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench on Wednesday heard a constitutional petition challenging the sales tax on women’s sanitary napkins, with the petitioner arguing the levy treats a basic health necessity as a luxury item and perpetuates gender inequality.
LHC Justice Jawad Hassan took up the petition, filed by Mahnoor Omer, which seeks to exempt sanitary pads and related products from sales tax.
With the court’s approval, the petition also added the Revenue Division via its Secretary as a respondent, arguing that the tax system indirectly discriminates against women and violates constitutional rights to equality and dignity as outlined in Articles 3, 9, 14, 25 and 37.
Advocate Ahsan Jehangir Khan, the petitioner’s counsel, said that only 12pc of menstruating women in Pakistan can afford commercial sanitary pads, forcing the rest to use unsafe alternatives.
Petition argues levy on sanitary napkins violates gender equality rights
He noted that locally manufactured sanitary products have an 18pc sales tax, while imports face a 25pc customs duty on top of sales tax. Even a key raw material, superabsorbent polymer (SAP) pa­­per, is subjected to a 25pc tax, he added.
“By taxing sanitary products, the state is penalising women for a natural biological function,” the counsel argued.
The bench, whoever, questioned the maintainability of the petition in light of the 26th Constitutional Amendment and raised jurisdictional concerns since the respondents, including the Revenue Division, are based in Islamabad. The petitioner’s counsel sought time to address these points.

Shah Zaman Khan of Swat, who currently resides in Amra Kalan village near Dinga town, alleged in his complaint with the police that he had been informed at around 12 on Friday that his minor son Eesa (5) was in a critical condition at the seminary, Madressa Jalalia Mazhar Islam, where he had been studying.
Upon reaching the seminary, the complainant said that he found his son in a critical condition, allegedly after a teacher Hafiz Arfan, Afzaal and an unidentified suspect subjected him to severe physical torture with sticks and kicks.
The injured child was shifted to the Dinga Civil Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.
The complainant’s other son, Musa (7), has also been a student at the same seminary, who too narrated the ordeal of his younger brother at the hands of their teacher.
A police team reached the spot and collected the evidence, whereas a team of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) also collected forensic evidence from the crime scene.
The autopsy was conducted at the Kharian Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, after which the body was handed over to the boy’s family.
The police have registered a case against two nominated and an unidentified suspect under sections 302 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
A Gujrat police spokesman says investigations have been initiated and raiding teams constituted to trace and arrest the culprits.

The HPV vaccine, first launched in Pakistan in 2022, has now been
rolled out
nationwide as part of the routine immunisation programme to protect adolescent girls against cervical cancer. However, vaccine
hesitancy
in Pakistan remains a major public health challenge, driven by a mix of misinformation, safety concerns, and mistrust of authorities.
In the latest incident yesterday, the HPV vaccination team was performing its duty in a non-formal education school in the village of Ratuwal, within the limits of Kathian Sheikhan police station, when a 55-year-old resident of the village entered the school and attempted to attack a female health supervisor.
According to Kathian Sheikhan’s Station House Officer Sabir Iqbal Sindhu, the suspect “tried to attack the supervisor with a stick and by lifting a chair, threatened serious consequences and used foul language”.
“The sudden attack caused a stampede in the school, and the vaccination process had to be stopped immediately,” he added.
Statement of the affected supervisor
Speaking to
Dawn
on the telephone, Health Supervisor Shamim Anjum said that she and her team were forced to leave the school to save their lives.
She said that after the incident, she submitted a written application to the Kathian Sheikhan police station, following which a case was registered.
However, she added, “The assurance of security given by the provincial health minister on the first incident of September 25 has not been fulfilled yet, and no practical action has been taken by the police.”
The SHO said that a case has been registered on the complaint of the affected woman. The first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
, was registered under sections 186 (obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the
Pakistan Penal Code
.
According to the police, action has been initiated against the suspect, who will be arrested soon.
An HPV vaccination team was also
attacked
in Mandi Bahauddin’s Chak No. 38 on Thursday, in which a woman was beaten up by locals.
The provincial health minister of Punjab, Khawaja Imran Nazeer, had taken notice of the incident and issued instructions to provide security to female health workers. Health workers, however, say there has been no implementation given Saturday’s attack.
When contacted by a
Dawn
representative about the matter, Mandi Bahauddin’s Chief Executive Officer of Health, declined to comment, hanging up the phone.
The repeated incidents of violence are affecting the performance of the campaign, as health workers say that unless they are provided with police security, it will not be possible for them to perform their duties.
The HPV vaccination campaign is being implemented in three phases: Phase 1 covered Punjab, Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Islamabad Capital Territory; Phase 2 will expand to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026; and Phase 3 will reach Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027.
Phase 1 of the campaign ran from 15–27 September. The goal is to vaccinate 90 per cent of girls aged 9–14 in Phase 1 regions by the end of 2025, and to sustain high coverage through routine immunisation in the coming years.",2025-09-28,Zaheer Abbas Sial,857,0.000124

According to police spokesperson Zeeshan Randhawa, the police were continuously chasing the dacoits after they kidnapped several people from the motorway a few days ago. He said that after a tip-off, action was taken against the kidnappers and all of the hostages were safely recovered.
As per details, on the night between Sept 4 and Sept 5, the Katcha area dacoits kidnapped 11 people from different vehicles on the Sukkur-Multan Motorway near Nawazabad in Sadiqabad tehsil. The bandits fired at vehicles on the motorway between 1 and 2am to force them to stop at the Azampur Rest Area and the Guddu Interchange.
In the attack, crew of a passenger bus was reportedly injured and shifted to the emergency ward of the Sheikh Zayed Medical College Hospital (SZMCH) in Rahim Yar Khan. Traffic also remained suspended on the motorway for more than four hours, before it was finally restored at dawn.
Incident happened after police operation near Punjab-Sindh border and Indhar gang threatened retribution
South Punjab Additi­onal Inspector General (IG) Kamran Khan told
Dawn
that between 20 and 25 suspects attacked vehicles on the motorway. “Three people were injured, two of whom suffered minor injuries, so they were discharged. One remains admitted at the hospital with gunshot wounds to the waist and leg,” he said.
SZMCH spokesperson Rana Ilyas Ahmed confirmed to
Dawn
that three injured were admitted to the facility and one was receiving treatment for a gunshot wound to the leg. The injured were aboard the same coach and hailed from Sheikhupura, he said.
The motorway incident came amid a police operation against the Katcha criminals in which the police used drones in Ronti near the Punjab-Sindh border. The police had destroyed the hideouts of Katcha criminals during the operation.
On the same day, Indhar gang leader Tanvir alias Dodu Indhar threatened the police with retribution. Later on September 8, Dodu Indhar claimed responsibility of the kidnapping. He also claimed that police had killed a person of his tribe after he was released from jail.
He claimed the police was planning a same fate for his brother who would be released in a few months. In another video showing nine of the hostages standing in the floodwater, he claimed that they had killed two of the passengers and demanded the release of his brother. However, all 11 passengers had been recovered alive during the operation.
It is pertinent to mention here that Katcha criminals have kidnapped 72 people so far this year. This is not the first time that the M-5 motorway was targeted by the criminals and after several incidents, the police started escorting vehicles in convoys.

conviction
in a May 9 case.
She claims to have been falsely implicated for political reasons.
Through her Advocate Sameer Khosa, Ms Shah argues that she had no involvement in the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squad vehicle near
Jinnah House
during the riots.
She maintained she was not named in the FIR, nor was she implicated throu­­gh supplementary statements.
No identification para­­de was conducted to establish her presence at the scene.
The trial, held inside Kot Lakhpat jail, resulted in 21 acquittals out of 51 accused, with 12 declared proclaimed offenders. Ms Shah was among the 18 convicted, recently sentenced to five years in prison and fined Rs100,000.
The appeal highlights that the prosecution’s case relied solely on her social media activity post-May 9, 2023.
However, the trial court scrutinized her entire online data without legal basis, terming the charges “defective, vague, and unsustainable.
The appeal stresses that the judgement was “assu­mption-based” and lacked credible evidence linking Shah to the alleged offenses.
Her legal team urged the Lahore High Court to set aside the Sept 9 verdict of the anti-terrorism court and acquit her of all charges.

In the first encounter, the police said a suspect was killed while his two accomplices escaped.
They said a case was registered at Nilore police station under various sections, including 302 (murder), of the Pakistan Penal Code, and the Arms Ordinance and the Control of Narcotic Substances Act (CNSA). The suspect was a proclaimed offender wanted by Nilore police in connection with three separate cases, they claimed. The police said they received information about the proclaimed offender hiding with his accomplices in a house located at Dhoke Mohri.
The police cordoned off the house and asked the suspect to surrender. However, the suspect and his two accomplices opened fire from three directions.
After about 20 minutes, the firing stopped, and two men jumped over the house wall and fled towards Charah Hills while continuing to fire at the police.
According to police, the proclaimed offender was killed by the firing of his own accomplices. A Kalashnikov, magazines, and crystal meth were also recovered from him.
Examination of the body revealed bullet wounds on different parts. It was later shifted to a hospital for autopsy.
In another encounter, a suspect in police custody was injured during a shootout with his accomplices, who later escaped.
Noon police had earlier arrested two men in connection with a murder-cum-robbery incident that took place in August. During interrogation, one suspect disclosed the location of their accomplices’ hideout in an under-construction house in I-15/5.
In response, a 13-member police team took the two suspects to the hideout. The police said that, suddenly, four unidentified men opened fire on the police near the house in an attempt to free the suspects and kill the officers.
During the crossfire, one suspect sustained a bullet wound in the back of his neck, while the other was shot in the knee. The police team remained unharmed as they took defensive positions.
Three attackers managed to escape, while one was arrested, and a 30-bore pistol was recovered from him. The injured suspects were shifted to a hospital for treatment.

The federal government last month
informed
the provinces that the formal repatriation and deportation of over 1.3 million Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards will begin on September 1.
The decision followed the interior ministry’s announcement on July 31 that PoR cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
According to notifications dated September 25, 2025 and issued by theMinistry of States and Frontier Regions (Safron) — copies of which are available with
Dawn.com
— denotified camps are located in Haripur, Chitral and Upper Dir in KP, Chaghai, Loralai, Killa Saifullah, Pishin and Quetta in Balochistan, and Mianwali in Punjab.
When asked about the opinion on denotifying camps where thousands of refugees are staying, the Afghan Chief Commission did not respond to a request for comment.
Haji Abdul Samad, who is representative of a main camp in Haripur, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, told
Dawn.com
this week that local officials have told him to vacate the camp in accordance with the government’s policy.
He, however, said there has been no raid, arrest or pressure on refugees to leave the Panian camp, which houses about 13,000 families and over 90,000 refugees, according to Abdul Samad.
Chief Minister KP Ali Amin Khan Gandapur stated on a number of occasions that his government will not force refugees to return.
The Safron ministry notifications say all lands within the denotified areas will be handed over to the provincial governments and deputy commissioners of the concerned districts.
They also read that all non-movable assets within the notified area will also be handed over to the provinces and deputy commissioners.
Most of the camps
had been set up
in early 1980s when refugees started coming to Pakistan after the invasion of the erstwhile Soviet Union.
UNHCR concerned
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN refugee agency, has shown concern at Pakistan’s decision to denotify some of the refugee villages.
It reiterated that returns to Afghanistan should be voluntary, phased, safe and dignified.
“Many of the people affected are Afghan refugees who have lived for years in these villages and have expressed great despair about how this development is going to impact on their lives,” spokesperson for UNHCR Pakistan, Qaiser Khan Afridi, told
Dawn.com
on Saturday.
“In particular, UNHCR urges that people with international protection needs and those with humanitarian considerations face particular challenges and should be protected against (forced) returns,” Afridi said.
Pakistan started repatriation of Afghan refugees
in 2023
over security concerns and amid tension with the
Taliban government
.
Pakistan also argues that war has ended in Afghanistan and refugees should go back.
However, the refugees complain about the lack of transport. They say that they face problems finding trucks for shifting their household goods.
Gada Ali Khan Zadran, a representative of the refugees at Mianwali camp, told
Dawn.com
that refugees are facing difficulties in finding transport to take household items to Afghanistan.
Zadran also said that the fare of transport has also been increased from Rs300,000 to 600,000.
According to UNHCR, there were over 1.3 million Afghans in Pakistan as of June 30, 2025. More than half of them (717,945) lived in KP, 326,584 in Balochistan, 195,188 in Punjab, 75,510 in Sindh and 43,154 in Islamabad.",2025-09-27,Tahir Khan,915,0.000129

“Yes, a proposal for imposing taxes to meet operational cost of JMC and Research Centre is under consideration,” said an official source. He said before imposing the special taxes, legislation was required.
“I am not supposed to finalise the new taxes, but I guess these can be imposed on junk food and other unhealthy items such as cigarettes and smoking and on any unhealthy activity,” said the official source.
Official says taxes can be imposed on junk food and other unhealthy items
The PC-I worth Rs212 billion has already been approved for the medical complex and research centre. The project will be executed in two phases. In the first phase, a hospital will be built and in the second a medical college and other related facilities will be developed.
The CDA has already earmarked over 600 kanals in H-16 for the complex.
The CDA board recently also approved the bid of a consultant — a joint venture of Turkish and Pakistani company. Sources said that the CDA will soon issue a letter of acceptance to the JV for starting work on the first phase of the project worth Rs75 billion.
The consultant firm will review the design of the project and finalise the bidding documents for the construction work.
The project will be executed under the Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) mode.
Meanwhile, the bidding for construction of the boundary wall of the JMC and research centre will be opened this week.
The groundbreaking ceremony for medical complex was performed by the prime minister on July 21, 2024.
Addressing the groundbreaking ceremony, the prime minister had said that the complex was going to be the region’s one of the best medical
centres where deserving people would get 100 per cent free medical treatment.
“This is the gift of the coalition government not only for the residents of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, but also for people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan,” Mr Sharif said, adding that once completed the medical complex would offer the world’s best healthcare facilities with various sections for diseases related to heart, kidneys, lungs, cancer and others.

10th Avenue project
has almost come to a halt as the federal government has decided not to fund it anymore, while CDA has yet to arrange any financing for it.
Work is continuing at a snail’s pace, apparently only to keep a handful of labourers and machinery engaged by the contractor, the National Logistics Cell (NLC).
The earthwork on the project has been almost completed from IJP Road to H-9, and with little attention the government and CDA could finish this portion of the road after carrying out asphalt work.
Two bridges built under the project are already being used by motorists, but other incomplete infrastructure, such as pillars, is deteriorating.
CDA yet to arrange funds for multi-billion project as only 48pc work completed despite two deadline extensions
The project was started by the CDA with federal government funding in 2022 and was supposed to be completed by March 2024.
However, it has yet to achieve even 50 per cent progress. Launched in 2022 under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) at a cost of Rs10.2 billion, the project was to be completed by March 2024.
Its deadline has been extended twice, but so far, only around 48pc work has been completed, according to sources.
CDA officials have attributed the delay to the slow release of funds, saying the government has released around Rs4 billion so far.
Under the project, a five-kilometre road is being constructed from Katarian Bridge on Karnal Sher Khan Road (formerly IJP Road) to Srinagar Highway near the intersection of G-9 and G-10 sectors.
In the federal budget for fiscal year 2025-26, the project was dropped from the funding list, and it was expected that the CDA would complete it through its own resources.
However, sources said the CDA has not paid any attention to resolving the issue.
Meanwhile, residents of adjoining areas have been waiting for the project’s completion for over three years.
It is worth noting that 10th Avenue is a major artery in Islamabad, included in the city’s master plan.
According to the plan, after every one sector, a major road is to be constructed. For example, 7th Avenue runs between G-6 and G-7, 8th Avenue (Faisal Avenue) passes through G-7 and G-8, and 9th Avenue divides G-8 and G-9.
After 9th Avenue, however, the CDA has failed to build any new major road, with 10th Avenue stuck in limbo.
When contacted, the CDA spokesperson in a written reply said,
“The construction work is in progress, with the CDA engineering team and the consultant working to maintain high standards of quality construction. However, the project is awaiting funds from the PSDP to ensure its timely completion.”
He said the release of these funds is important to avoid delays and maintain momentum in construction activities.
“Out of Rs10 billion for the project, Rs8 billion is still required. The CDA has already taken up the matter with the Planning Commission for expediting the allocation of the requisite funds to ensure the project’s completion,” he added.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939527/floods-damaged-vast-areas-of-farmland-in-kp-un-ocha,Floods damaged vast areas of farmland in KP: UN-OCHA - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has said that 3,233 acres of agricultural land were damaged during the ongoing
floods
in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The ‘Rapid Needs Assessment’ report prepared by UN-OCHA says Buner recorded the largest losses of agricultural land with 1,157 acres affected, followed by Swat with 853 acres, Shangla with 559 acres, and Swabi with 330 acres.
Over 80 per cent of people reported crop losses which were significant in Battagram and Mansehra, while Lower Dir and Torghar reported smaller but notable losses, further threatening food security and livelihoods, the UN-OCHA report says.
People lost about 6,206 livestock across the affected areas of 10 districts. Buner reported the highest losses with 4,818 animals, followed by Swat with 618, Shangla with 295, Battagram with 219, and Swabi with 105. Smaller but significant losses were recorded in Bajaur, Mansehra, Torghar, and Upper Dir, while Lower Dir reported minimal impact.
Report says over 80pc of people reported crop losses; 6,206 livestock lost
The loss of livestock further weakened the livelihoods of rural households already facing crop damage and displacement.
Across most flood-affected areas, market access has remained relatively stable. Overall, 77 per cent of markets were reported as accessible, with full access in districts such as Bajaur, Battagram, Lower Dir, Tor Ghar, and Upper Dir.
Swat and Mansehra also reported high levels of access, showing that even in areas severely hit by floods, physical access to markets was somehow maintained. However, Buner had the lowest access at only 35 per cent, leaving people there with limited options for essential supplies.
Despite this physical access, food and non-food availability in markets remains a challenge across many districts.
The regular supply of essential commodities was disrupted in 55 per cent of the affected areas, with Swabi, Shangla, and Swat facing the most significant interruptions.
This means that while people in several districts can reach markets, goods they need are often either unavailable or supplied inconsistently, affecting food security and basic household needs.
Despite considerable efforts by the KP government and humanitarian actors, the assessment data reveals that many affected people continue to face critical gaps in assistance across multiple sectors.
Food assistance reached the largest proportion of affected households at 42 per cent overall, with significant support reported in Buner, Swabi, and Shangla districts.
However, in Battagram, Lower Dir, Torghar, and Upper Dir districts, people reported no or very limited food assistance. Similarly, health services were the second-most supported sector, reaching 39 pc of the affected population.
Major health interventions were reported in Buner (82pc), Swabi (50pc), and Shangla (22pc), but Torghar and Upper Dir districts reported no health assistance at all. In terms of shelter support, only 20 per cent of households reported receiving assistance.
Districts like Swabi (50pc) and Buner (31pc) reported the highest coverage, whereas most other districts reported minimal or no assistance despite extensive housing damages. Nutrition support was reported by just 15pc of people, largely concentrated in Buner (48pc), with almost no coverage in other districts, leaving children and pregnant women at risk.
The
education sector
was the least supported, with only 2pc coverage, despite widespread damage to school infrastructure in districts like Buner, Swat, and Shangla, potentially impacting thousands of children.
Overall, the data highlights that while food and health received the most attention, shelter, nutrition, and education remain critically underserved, requiring targeted and sustained interventions to bridge the assistance gaps across all affected districts.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939969,SMOKERS’ CORNER: THE WATER WARS - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"’Hydro-politics’ or ‘water politics’ is nothing new. But thanks to climate change, hydro-politics between countries is witnessing a manifold increase in intensity. On the one hand, climate change is compounding the problem of water scarcity and, on the other, it is triggering heavier rainfalls and flooding.
Various countries share common sources of fresh water. For this, they sign water-sharing treaties. Recognition of these treaties involves the signatory nations and international organisations. There is no single global authority to enforce these agreements, though.
In a 2023 essay, the sustainability specialist Emmanuel Gutman-Gates wrote that the increasing frequency of water-related conflicts and the ‘weaponisation of water’ in specific instances suggest that water politics is a growing source of instability and conflict.
The water dispute over the Indus River, for example, is a major source of tension between India and Pakistan. In April this year, India “
suspended
” the
Indus Waters Treaty
(IWT) that was signed in 1960 between the two countries. This has escalated the threat of serious confrontation between the two historically antagonistic neighbours.
From the Indus to the Rio Grande, rivers are no longer just lifelines — they are now battlefronts. As climate change shrinks and floods waterways, nations are turning treaties into weapons and neighbours into rivals
In August, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague
ruled
that the IWT does not allow for unilateral suspension. But India rejected the verdict. Pakistan’s army chief allegedly responded by claiming that it would take just 10 missiles for Pakistan to destroy any new dams built by India to disrupt the water supply to Pakistan.
River Indus is Pakistan’s largest river. It originates in Tibet and then goes through India before entering Pakistan. Climate change is disrupting the flow of the river, which is an important water source for both countries. Pakistan has often accused India of using its upstream position to threaten its water supply.
Nevertheless, in May this year, the former irrigation minister Mohsin Laghari wrote in
The Nation
, “The IWT treaty now risks obsolescence — designed for a bygone era, it is ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of climate change and geopolitical volatility.” The treaty needs to be reframed, but India’s recent act of suspending it has further compounded the issue.
Afghanistan has been facing a scarcity of water. The River Amu Darya is a vital source of water for Afghanistan and its northern neighbours, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The Taliban regime in Kabul is planning to make a canal, which is likely to lessen the flow of Amu into Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan by 15 percent. Both the countries are now negotiating with Kabul to resolve the issue peacefully.
The Kabul River, which flows into Pakistan from Afghanistan, sustains the lives of millions of people on both sides. There have been attempts by Afghanistan to build dams on this river, which Pakistan fears are likely to disrupt the supply of water to Pakistan. However, due to constant political turmoil and civil wars in Afghanistan, no such major dam has been built yet. Nevertheless, Pakistan is eager to sign a water treaty with Kabul sooner than later.
Water reserves in Iraq have hit their lowest levels in 80 years. This is straining Iraq’s relations with its upstream neighbours Iran and Turkey, who are blatantly restricting flows in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Iraq. According to the researcher Hayder Al-Shakeri, the Iraqi government has, however, failed to respond with professional water diplomacy. Corruption among Iraq’s political elite has weakened institutional capacity. This creates openings for Turkey and Iran to press for deals that serve their own priorities.
Another long-running hydro-political flashpoint has been over the Jordan River. The tension in this regard is mainly between Israel and Jordan. Both the countries signed a water treaty in 1994 to diplomatically resolve the issue, but climate change, wars in the region and an increase in the populations of Jordan and Israel are severely testing the treaty.
The
River Rio Grande
, which flows from the US to Mexico, has been rapidly dwindling due to climate change, overuse and outdated water management practices. It is a source of a decades-long dispute between the US and Mexico. Rio Grande is also one of the most endangered rivers in the world. Mexico has fallen behind on its commitments under the 1944 US-Mexico Water Treaty.
However, this year, the US and Mexico announced that they would ‘upgrade’ the treaty according to current needs and conditions. But experts believe the current framework is still inadequate to fully resolve the issue due to the river drying up at an alarming pace.
Water politics has also become a prominent part of the internal politics of various countries. This includes political and social issues surrounding the management, allocation and distribution of water resources within a country’s borders.
For example, water disputes between states/provinces in India are intensifying due to disagreements over the use, distribution and control of inter-state river waters. It is one of the tensest issues in Indian federalism today. India has just four per cent of the world’s freshwater supplies but holds a massive 18 per cent of the world’s total population.
Pakistan’s two major provinces, Punjab and Sindh, are constantly
locking horns
over the waters of River Indus. Climate change is intensifying this tussle, especially with monsoon patterns becoming unpredictable. Indus River flows are likely to decrease and the risk of both floods and droughts likely to increase. There is now greater awareness of climate change among most people, but it only receives obligatory lip-service from the governments and the state.
For example, political opponents are more invested in pulling each other’s legs for failing to control flash flooding in major urban areas. There has been no show of any serious intent by the state and politicians to address the impacts of climate change beyond attacking each other for being incompetent.
In south-eastern Australia, the vast river system and drainage basin, the Murray-Darling Basin, is a flashpoint for internal water politics involving states and farmers. A major government initiative — the Basin Plan — to resolve the issue has continued to be ineffective due to disputes between federal and state governments, with New South Wales and Victoria often reluctant to accept the plan.
In the US, long-running battles over shared water resources have intensified due to the impact of climate change, particularly involving the Colorado River and Rio Grande basins. In Ethiopia, serious water imbalances between regions have been a major issue in the country’s politics.
Environmental activists spent decades to finally make the term ‘climate change’ a frequent part of everyday vocabulary — even among its deniers. Yet, it remains a vague term for many because, despite experiencing its impacts more than ever, no one seems to know how to address it. This is not to suggest that there are no solutions. But most of these require dramatic changes in political policies and in established lifestyle practices, which can create social, economic and political disruptions.
But one wonders: what more can be more disruptive than melting glaciers, increasing droughts, frequent floods, unprecedented rainfalls, dying rivers and water disputes that can lead to outright wars between nations?

• Villages in Multan, Lodhran and Bahawalpur submerged after Noraja Bhutta breaches
LAHORE: Punjab Minister for School Education Rana Sikandar Hayat said on Thursday that 3,000 schools had been destroyed in the
floods
, severely affecting the education of thousands of students.
He was speaking during a meeting with Unicef’s Representative to Pakistan, Pernille Ironside, to discuss progress on various educational plans. The meeting also decided to strengthen cooperation for better outcomes.
The minister informed the Unicef representative that the school education department was facing immense challenges due to floods in the province.
He said that the department had already been facing a shortage of facilities, but the disaster had destroyed thousands of schools, many of which were still under water.
“The department is now confronted with the challenge of rehabilitating these schools,” he said, adding that three shifts were being started in functioning schools to meet the educational needs of displaced students.
The minister said that it would take around three months to rehabilitate the damaged schools. In the meantime, the government planned to rent private buildings and establish tent schools in flood-hit areas to ensure continuity of classes.
He added that the government had waived semester fees for students belonging to flood-hit areas and that scholarships would also be provided to them.
Several villages submerged
Meanwhile, despite official claims of receding floodwaters across Punjab, three breaches at the Noraja Bhutta embankment on the Sutlej River have led to catastrophic ponding, submerging several villages in the districts of Multan, Lodhran, and Bahawalpur for over a week.
The situation remains dire in the eastern areas of Jalalpur Pirwala, Lodhran and Bahawalpur, where villages, including Noraja Bhutta, Basti Lang, Kotla Chakar, Bahadurpur, Mouza Kanu, Kandeer, Jhaiyu, Deepal, Tarut Basharat, Daily Rajanpur, Belaywala, Dunyapur, Jhangra, Muradpur Soiwala and Sabra are surrounded by 8 to 10 feet of stagnant water. The relentless pressure has caused widespread destruction of homes and property.
“The water isn’t going down. About 70 per cent of houses have already collapsed, and the rest will follow if nothing is done,” said Altaf Lang, a distressed local resident. “The standing water has changed colour, and we are now seeing the spread of waterborne diseases. This is a health crisis in the making.”
Residents point to a major infrastructural obstacle: the nearby motorway. They allege that the culverts designed to allow water to pass underneath are insufficient and are instead acting as a dam, trapping the water on one side.
“The motorway isn’t usable for traffic now anyway. The authorities should breach it to let this water drain,” argued Altaf Lang. “The current culverts are not for water passage; they are just for locals and cattle to cross. They are completely blocked.”
NHA General Manager Kashif Nawaz told
Dawn
that there was no question of breaching the motorway and that water was passing through culverts underneath. He added that efforts were being made to secure the motorway by placing stones around vulnerable points, without closing the culverts.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941636,Security at stake - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"IT is deeply unfortunate that the security of millions is potentially being put at stake over the persistent antipathy between the PTI and the government.
And yet, instead of resolving their differences and setting some rules of engagement, both sides continue to cross lines that should not be crossed. In jail and with the walls seemingly closing in, former prime minister Imran Khan has taken an increasingly
combative position
against the authorities.
It appears that the recent arrest of his
nephews
, who have since been released on bail, has greatly provoked him. In
statements
attributed to him and shared from his X account on Thursday, the jailed PTI leader has
directed
the KP government as well as provincial lawmakers to resist the
military operations
being conducted in the province to clear it of terrorists. This is a dangerous and problematic position to take, especially given the social sensitivities involved.
Mr Khan seems to believe that the military operations are merely a tool to politically hurt his party, which rules the province. He has also asserted that they are being conducted “merely to please foreign powers”. However, these positions are contradicted by the ground realities in KP, where militancy is visibly
resurgent
and
repeated attacks
by terrorists have claimed many lives and spoilt what hard-fought peace had been achieved in previous years. There is, indeed, strong
local opposition
to security operations as well, because kinetic operations invariably entail the
displacement
of civilian populations and subsequent economic losses due to disrupted livelihoods.
However, the citizenry seems equally wary of the growing influence of terrorists and other violent actors and does not want them to gain a foothold either. In such a situation, a national leader should propose a middle-ground solution that protects citizens’ interests while recognising national security imperatives. Unfortunately, Mr Khan seems to be letting anger get the better of his judgement.
It would be amiss not to point out the failings on the other side as well. Perhaps due to the way politics,
justice
and governance have shaped up under the present regime, the powerful seem to be operating under the assumption that their will can be imposed on the people without consequences. This is a dangerous presumption.
Decisions that can drastically affect citizens’ lives cannot be taken behind closed doors. There needs to be political ownership of such choices, which can only happen if those who are to be affected by them have been adequately heard and their concerns accommodated. Pressing ahead without public consent can prove disastrous in case unforeseen challenges end up complicating operational aims.
Hence, there should be a much greater focus on attaining political buy-in, and if making certain concessions can help achieve it, they should be considered. There needs to be some give and take.

• FO adopts cautious approach; cites ‘evolving doctrine’ but offers no specifics
• Dar hints other states also interested in defence deals
ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s conflicting statements about Pakistan’s new
defence agreement
with Saudi Arabia have intensified speculation about the pact’s nuclear dimension.
During an appearance on a TV talk show on Thursday night, Mr Asif had
suggested
that Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities could be made available to Riyadh under the new framework.
“What we have, and the capabilities we possess, will be made available to (Saudi Arabia) according to this agreement,” he said, stressing that Pakistan has always acted as a responsible nuclear state.
The remarks were interpreted as the first explicit signal that Pakistan might extend its nuclear deterrence to the kingdom, particularly as Mr Asif was present at the signing ceremony in Riyadh.
However, in a subsequent interview with
Reuters
, the minister denied that nuclear weapons were part of the accord, saying they were “not on the radar”.
Amid the confusion, the Foreign Office on Friday seemed to choose ‘strategic silence’, adopting a
cautious approach
.
At the weekly media briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan sidestepped repeated questions on whether the pact alters Pakistan’s long-declared policy of keeping its nuclear deterrent India-centric, and not extending it to another country.
Asked twice whether that stance had changed, Mr Khan only referred to an evolving doctrine. “The doctrine has evolved and continues to do so,” he said. “I am not here to comment on the specificity of the doctrine, but our position is well known.”
Pakistan has consistently declared its nuclear programme is intended to deter India alone.
In Dec, the Foreign Office said: “Pakistan has made it abundantly clear that our strategic programme and allied capabilities are solely meant to deter and thwart a clear and visible existential threat from our neighbourhood and should not be perceived as a threat to any other country.”
Mr Khan, while parrying question about whether rules of engagement related to troop deployment in Saudi Arabia have been revised, framed the agreement as a consolidation of longstanding ties with Riyadh.
“Since the 1960s, defence cooperation has served as one of the principal pillars of Pakistan-Saudi Arabia’s all-encompassing bilateral relations,” Mr Khan said. “The strategic mutual defence agreement formalises this decades-old and robust defence partnership.”
When asked if the agreement was aimed to check Israel’s aggressive designs in the region, he said, “It is defensive in nature and not directed against any third country. It will contribute to regional peace, security and stability.”
Speculation about extended deterrence was first sparked by a Saudi official who, shortly after the agreement was signed, hinted to a Western news agency that Riyadh would under the agreement get nuclear cover. Saudi commentators later amplified the claim.
The joint statement that announced the accord, formally titled the “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement”, described it as an initiative “to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression”.
Other states ‘interested’: Dar
Separately, speaking to reports in London, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar hinted that some other states were also showing an interest in building strategic defence agreements with Pakistan.
“It’s premature to say anything, but some other countries want to enter into an agreement of this nature,” Mr Dar told reporters in London, replying to a question about whether other states will join the pact or ink similar deals. “This was not signed overnight; it has taken several months.”
Calling the agreement a “historic pact”, FM Dar said Pakistan has always maintained an informal defence arrangement with Saudi Arabia, which is the same as the agreement signed on Wednesday.
“I believe that both sides are very happy. Let’s be frank: Saudi Arabia has stood with us during difficult times, such as the sanctions. Their support was very relevant and important,” he added. “Similarly, during the current crisis since 2022-2023, when we needed IMF (International Monetary Fund) support, Saudi Arabia stood with us.”

Talking to
Dawn
, Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said that in the first phase, 80 electric buses would arrive in Rawalpindi in October and begin service from the second week of the month.
“Rawalpindi city will get 80 eco-friendly buses for 10 new routes. The total length of these routes is 86 kilometres, connecting Rawalpindi with the airport, railway station, metro bus stations, general bus stand, Islamabad, and other parts of the garrison city,” Mr Cheema said.
He added that the electric bus system would be integrated with Islamabad’s transport network, allowing seamless travel between the twin cities.
Punjab government to launch eco-friendly transport system across 10 routes
The provincial government’s main objective, he said, was to reduce pollution in Rawalpindi and cantonment areas while providing a modern transport system linked to the Metro Bus service.
Work has already started on a bus depot to accommodate up to 100 electric buses.
“To park the buses, we decided to construct the depot on 28 kanals of land on Peshawar Road,” he said. The land, already owned by the Transport and Masstransit Department, posed no acquisition challenges.
The Regional Transport Authority (RTA) has allocated 10 new routes for the service.
Route One will run from the Railway Station to the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi Bench, while Route Two will cover Koral Chowk to Fawara Chowk.
Route Three will operate from Umar Baig Chowk to Mandi Mor, and Route Four from Munawar Colony to Saddar. Route Five will connect Marrir Chowk to Motorway Mor, while Route Six will run from Faizabad to Tramri Chowk.
Route Seven will operate from IJP Metro Station to Kuri Road, and Route Eight from Saddar to Lalarukh Colony. Route Nine will link Umair Baig Road to Qadeemi Imambargah Mohallah, while Route Ten will run through Saddar.
Mr Cheema said Rawalpindi, one of Pakistan’s major cities, has historically been an important commercial and administrative centre, but its transport infrastructure has struggled to keep pace with rapid urbanisation and population growth.
He noted that the Punjab Metro Bus System provided some relief through a dedicated rapid transit service, but it has not fully addressed transport challenges, as it mainly covers specific corridors while leaving many neighborhoods underserved.
“Many areas still lack adequate public transport, forcing residents to rely on private vehicles and informal services, which worsen congestion and pollution,” he said.
To address these transportation and environmental challenges, the Punjab government has included two schemes in the Annual Development Programme 2025–26, he said. They include the induction of e-buses and the development of urban bus depots with allied infrastructure.
He said the scheme for the induction of e-buses was already approved by the PDWP on October 25, 2024, and work on establishing the bus depot along with allied infrastructure is currently underway.

It said all those living along the riverbanks and within the katcha (riverine) and low-lying areas must move to safe places “as soon as possible”.
In case of any emergency or for assistance, people may contact the provincial control room by dialing 021-99222967, 021-99222902, 021-99222758, 021-99222759, Larkana office at 074-9410243, PDMA at 1736 or Rescue services at 1122.
Meanwhile, MPA Mir Nadir Magsi, who has been inspecting flood protective dykes between Guddu Barrage and all vulnerable areas for many days, has said such visits by ministers, lawmakers and relevant officials were necessitated to ensure people’s safety.
Around 700,000-cusec flood peak likely to reach Guddu today, warn officials; MPA Nadir Magsi says situation at Larkana-Khairpur, Dadu-Moro and Amri-Sehwan bridges is ‘not good’
Punjab has suffered
massive destruction
by rains and floods in recent weeks, and now
flood water
is about to reach Sindh, he said.
Speaking to
Dawn
at the Ruk Loop Bund in Shikarpur district on Friday, MPA Magsi said that last time, when the Tori dyke was washed away in flood, Sindh had submerged. “I have already visited Tori, KK, Ruk and Moria Loop bunds to inspect their strength. Strengthening work there is under way,” he said. At Ruk bund, a T-spur has recently been constructed under the Sindh Flood Reconstru­ction Project.
The lawmaker said that at KK (Kandhkot-Kashmore) bund, particularly at its 18-Mile point, water volume is huge. “Since it is shaped like an island and its riverbed is narrow, the pressure on the bund and noise of water flow are very high, which had caused concern,” he said.
He said that stone-dumping work there was under way. Currently, the water level at these dykes is rising.
“Floodwater causes more damage in the receding than rising phase, he believed, and prayed that such a situation should not occur.
According to him, the flood pressure in the Indus at the moment is on its right bank — between Guddu and Naushahro Feroze — where the chief engineer has carried out perfect work.
Situation grim
Nadir Magsi observed that the situation at the Larkana-Khairpur, Dadu-Moro, and Amri-Sehwan bridges “is not good”. But the water reduces by the time it reaches here, he said alluding to past experiences. “Larkana is under threat from the Larkana-Khairpur Bridge, where the riverbed is wide but the bridge itself is narrow.
He recalled that since 2010, he had been telling the authorities concerned that this bridge should either be widened or gates should be installed at it to reduce water pressure. “If the water pressure increased, everything will be destroyed,” he warned, arguing that the lower areas are within the river’s course and they would also be hit badly.
MPA Magsi said that the Abad Loop Bund had eroded last time but strengthening work had now been carried out there. “However, in my view, it remains the ‘most sensitive’ dyke. He added that water entering Sindh comes from, besides Chanab, other rivers which are dead channels, but when extra water comes from India and when dams break, floodwaters also enter Sindh.
Wherever water flows through the Indus River into Sindh, those routes are encroached upon, blocked with different structures or occupied by settlements. He estimated that the Indus River is carrying around 700,000 cusecs.
Earlier, MPA Magsi, along with the chief engineer of the right bank of Indus and other officials, visited five spurs of the Ruk Bund where the engineers concerned briefed him about the situation with the help of maps and satellite images.
He was optimistic that dykes would sustain the pressure.

super flood
and a strategy to carry out a massive relief and rescue operation in case of emergency.
The briefing was held in the office of the Sukkur Commissioner Abid Saleem Qureshi. It was attended by Brig Jameel of the Pakistan Army,
Lieutenant Jahangir of the Pakistan Navy and Wing Commander Atif of 93 Wing, besides deputy commissioners and additional deputy commissioners of Larkana division.
Brig Jameel told the officials that the Pakistan Army always stood with the nation and would remain at the forefront as and when needed. He said that the army was in constant contact with the divisional and district administrations in the face of the situation.
Brig Jameel stresses integrated strategy, effective inter-agency cooperation to meet security challenges in riverine areas
“There are security challenges in the riverine areas, which need to be tackled with an integrated strategy and by making inter-agency cooperation more effective,” he stressed.
Those present at the meeting were
Sukkur DC Nadir Shahzad Khan, DIG Faisal Abdullah Chachar, ADC-I Amir Ansari, ADC-II Hajin Ajan and senior officials from the PDMA, Rescue 1122 and related departments including irrigation, health, education and motorway.
Commissioner Qureshi told the meeting that all arrangements to deal with possible flood had been completed and that officers and employees of all departments concerned had been put on high alert.
He said relief and rescue work was in full swing in ‘sensitive’ areas of the division and control rooms had been established at the division and district levels.
He said that a large population in 36 UCs and over 750 villages, besides livestock and crops, could be affected if above 700,000 or up to one million cusecs passed through Guddu Barrage.
He said that 70 relief camps had been set up and more than 200 boats kept ready for the relief and rescue operation with the cooperation of PDMA, Navy and private sector. More than 600 boats would be made available for emergencies, he added.
In addition, a warehouse has been established by the PDMA in Sukkur where tents, boats, life jackets, and other necessary items were available.
Ministers on close watch
Separately, several ministers serving as focal persons for flood within their assigned areas have been keeping a close eye on water level in the Indus and various courses of flood across Sindh.
In Larkana, MPA Jamil Soomro, who is also the political secretary to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari visited Moria Loop, Akil Agani and other bunds on the right bank of the Indus.
Talking to journalists along with Larkana Commissioner Tahir Sangi, he said: “People living in the riverine areas are braver than those in the settled (pucca) areas as they do not fear the river. We have lived along the banks of the Indus River for centuries … we love Indus … this time, too, predictions are made about a super flood, but so far, the irrigation department and the administration have told me that thankfully, there is no situation like the 2010 super flood or any major flood”.
He said that although sudden developments could not be ruled out, for now, there was no immediate danger.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939277/karachi-court-rejects-bail-of-man-accused-of-concealing-evidence-in-marital-rape-case,Karachi court rejects bail of man accused of concealing evidence in marital rape case - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: A sessions court has dismissed the bail application of a man booked on charges of disappearance of evidence in a
case
pertaining to alleged marital rape.
The suspect, Viko Maheshwari, is a relative of the prime suspect who was held for allegedly torturing and sexually assaulting his 19-year-old wife, who later
died
after
remaining in a coma
for over two weeks.
Viko had filed an application before Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Abdul Zahoor Chandio and sought post-arrest bail, while the complainant side had filed no objection to the application.
After hearing the state prosecutor, Irfana Qadri, who opposed the bail plea, and the defence counsel, the court dismissed the plea, observing that the “overwhelming gravity of the offences, the prima facie evidence connecting the applicant/accused to the crime of screening the offender, and the dubious nature of the no-objection affidavit.”
“These are amongst the most serious offences in penal jurisprudence, involving the brutal termination of a human life and a profound violation of personal dignity. The allegations depict a chilling narrative of spousal violence, sexual assault and a concerted effort to suppress the truth,” the judge observed.
Regarding the defence counsel’s argument that the suspect’s name was not mentioned in the FIR, the court noted: “No doubt, the applicant/accused’s name is not in the FIR, but the subsequent investigation has evidently uncovered his alleged role in the aftermath of the crime. The law is well settled that omission of a name in the FIR is not fatal to the prosecution’s case if credible evidence is later discovered.”
“The applicant/accused’s presence at the hospital is not, as claimed, a marker of innocence but is rather a circumstance that forms part of the sequence of events as alleged by the prosecution, namely, his participation in the initial attempt to conceal the true cause of the victim’s death. The core of the matter lies in the nature and gravity of the offences alleged. The charges include those under Sections 302 (murder), 376-B (rape), and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) PPC,” it added.
The court also found a discrepancy in the affidavit filed by the complainant side in support of granting bail to the applicant.
“This inconsistency raises serious doubts about the authenticity and voluntariness of the affidavit of no objection. In the context of such a serious crime, which is an offence against the state, the wishes of a private complainant, especially when documented under questionable circumstances, cannot override the demands of justice and the need for a thorough investigation and trial.”
During the arguments, prosecutor Qadri contended before the court that the applicant, along with others, had allegedly signed an affidavit undertaking not to report the incident to the police, which is available on record and indicates his involvement in the matter. She further argued that the affidavit filed by the complainant carried no evidentiary value in such a case, where a newly-wed girl was brutally sexually assaulted by her husband, resulting in her death.

DWP also okays PC-I for construction of RCC sewer in low-lying areas from Rawat T. Chowk to Soan River
“Upgrading cricket grounds is a good step of CDA, but paying Rs15000 per match is highly difficult for club level cricketers. Besides, upgrading these facilities, CDA management should abolish the match fee for Saturdays and Sundays for club cricketers to promote sports. CDA should continue charging armature and corporate sectors,” said a club cricketer.
The CDA Development Working Party headed by Chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa approved PC-I of the projects.
A press release stated: “In line with the vision of Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi CDA-DWP decided to upgrade cricket and football grounds across the city to promote healthy activities in Islamabad.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
According to a press release issued by the NIH, one of the cases was detected in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil in a 19-month-old infant, while the other case was confirmed in an 11-month-old infant in Lakki Marwat’s Suleman Khel tehsil.
The two new cases have taken the total number of cases reported in KP to 18, the highest out of any province in the country. The nationwide tally now stands at 26, with six cases from Sindh, 18 from KP and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan, NIH said.
Detailing the results of August’s environmental sewage samples regarding polio — collected from 87 districts across the country — the NIH said, “of the 126 environmental samples tested, 75 were found negative with no poliovirus detected, while 51 samples tested positive.”
As per NIH,  out of a total of 23 samples tested for polio in Balochistan, only one was positive, while in KP, out of 34 samples tested, 10 were found to be positive.
Punjab recorded 14 polio-positive samples, out of 31 tested; Polio virus was found in 24 of the 29 samples tested in Sindh, 12 of which were in Karachi, as per the NIH.
One sample each was found positive for the virus in GB and Islamabad.
“Balochistan reported a marked reduction, with only one positive environmental site in July and August, down from 19 in January,” the press release said.
“In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, positive environmental sites dropped from 13 in April to 10 in August,” it noted, adding that “seven out of the 10 positive sites were in the south of the province, while all samples from Peshawar tested negative for the virus.
“In Islamabad, the number of positive environmental sites has decreased from three in July to one in August,” the press release said.
NIH expressed concern at the “continued detection of cases, particularly in southern KP,” stating that “children living in hard-to-reach areas and those in communities with low vaccine acceptance remain most at risk.”
In connection with that, a sub-national polio campaign began in southern KP today and is set to run for the next three days until September 18.
“A special action plan for southern KP was developed and [is] being implemented under the supervision of Chief Secretary KP, focusing on strengthening monitoring, addressing access challenges, and promoting community-led initiatives to reach unreached children in high-risk areas,” the statement read.
KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah has “directed urgent, intensified efforts to ensure no child is left unvaccinated,” the press release said.
“Earlier this month, the National Emergency Operations Centre conducted a sub-national polio vaccination campaign from 1–7 September 2025 in 81 districts across the country, successfully reaching more than 19.8 million children under five,” it added.
NIH urged parents and caregivers to play their part in helping eradicate polio.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.",2025-09-15,Rukhsana Khan,891,0.000127
https://www.dawn.com/news/1941615/senate-panel-approves-reforms-in-family-laws,Senate panel approves reforms in family laws - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Law and Justice on Friday appro­ved reforms in criminal and family laws, with a strong focus on access to justice and protection of vulnerable groups.
In its session held at Parliament House and presided over by Senator Farooq Hamid Naek, the committee passed the Pakistan Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which was moved by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, which raises the minimum value of diyat from 30,663 grams to 45,000 grams of silver.
The adjustment aims to reflect current economic realities and ensure fair compensation for the heirs of victims in line with inflation.
Senator Zehri said the amendment was framed strictly under Islamic injunctions, while Senator Kamran Murtaza voiced dissent, warning that the higher amount could disproportionately burden less privileged convicts.
Senators endorse bills piloted by Samina Zehri as ‘pro-women’
The committee chairman defended the move, calling it essential for deterrence and “a step towards upholding the sanctity of life”.
The committee also adopted the Family Courts (Amend­ment) Bill, 2024, another initiative by Senator Zehri, which mandates that maintenance amount for divorced women and their children must be fixed at the very first hearing. If the defendant fails to pay maintenance amount by the 14th of each month, the defence will be struck off and the case decided on available evidence.
“This amendment ensures timely relief and upholds the dignity of vulnerable families,” Senator Zehri said, noting that divorce cases often drag on for years to the detriment of women and children.
Members of the committee strongly endorsed the reform as pro-women and public-friendly legislation, though Senator Murtaza raised concerns over its compatibility with Article 10-A of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to a fair trial.
Meanwhile, the Constitu­tion (Amendment) Bill, 2025, introduced by Senator Mohammad Abdul Qadir and proposing changes to Article 27, was withdrawn by the mover after the committee observed that the measure was redundant in view of a recent Supreme Court ruling and existing constitutional safeguards.
The meeting was attended by Senators Shahadat Awan, Kamran Murtaza, and Samina Mumtaz Zehri, alongside officials from relevant ministries and departments.

• Calls for building small dams, reservoirs, instead of mega projects
• Terms local govts essential for disaster management
• House to formally begin debate on floods today
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly’s new session on Monday began with an unusual display of unity as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed solidarity with
flood victims
, but this bonhomie proved short-lived as the opposition refused to attend a briefing by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
Addressing a news conference outside Parliament House soon after the adjournment of the sitting, PTI leaders, including Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Asad Qaiser, announced they had decided not to attend the briefing on the orders of incarcerated party leader Imran Khan.
Proceedings continued only for an hour or so before Speaker Ayaz Sadiq cut short the sitting, announcing that the NDMA had arranged a briefing for some 100 MNAs at 6pm and asking members to attend it.
Earlier, the house suspended the normal agenda of the day and decided to initiate a full-fledged debate on the ongoing
flood catastrophe
that had caused
massive devastation
in the country’s northern areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, besides inundating a vast area of Punjab due to release of water by neighbouring India.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry moved a motion to begin a formal debate on “the situation arising out of the recent devastating floods in the country”.
‘Man-made disaster’
The highlight of the brief NA sitting was the speech of Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, who termed the recent devastation caused by floods “a man-made disaster”.
The minister also called for local government elections in the country, besides stressing the need for building small dams and reservoirs to avert such tragedies in future.
“The catastrophe we are facing [today] cannot be called a natural disaster,” the minister declared.
“We have done value addition by constructing hotels and houses on waterways. We have encroached riverbeds,” he said, adding that this was the third or fourth such disaster in last 12 to 14 years.
Without naming anyone, he said when someone would be obliged to build a housing society on a riverbed, nature would react.
“In KP also, the people had encroached natural flow of rivers. What steps we have taken to remove encroachments on waterways after the country faced similar floods some three years back. He said they would face such tragedies again and again if they did not change their way.
Highlighting damages caused by floods in his home constituency, Mr Asif alleged a “contracting company” had destroyed his city of Sialkot.
“They are influential people and sitting in the Senate,” he said, pointing the finger at Zahir Khan and Bros (ZKB).
It was unfortunate that all big dams had been built by military dictators, while politicians had built hotels on riverbeds, he regretted.
He suggested building hundreds of small dams and reservoirs, instead of waiting for decades to build mega projects, warning that water would become an extremely scarce commodity in the future.
He was of the opinion that they needed to build small dams, which could be completed within a year or two.
“Do not do politics on it. We have political differences, but climate is a national, rather international issue, and it needs a national response,” he said.
LG system
“A comprehensive and robust local government system is needed to serve the masses in the cities, villages and tehsils,” said the minister amid desk-thumping by the members, regretting that presently there were no local body institutions in Punjab and other parts of the country.
The local bodies were essential for disaster management, he said, adding that power must be dispersed to towns, villages, tehsils and districts.
Earlier, Ali Muhammad Khan of the PTI said the federal government should come forward to help KP people. He called for a detailed parliamentary discussion on water issues and the need for building new dams.
“The whole house should think over it as to how we can build dams and reservoirs. There should be no politics on the issue of dams,” the PTI leader said.
He asked the federal government to complete work on Mohmand Dam project that had been started by the PTI’s government.
He said political parties had failed to build even a single big water reservoir.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan drew the attention of the house towards the flood devastations in his Buner constituency, stating that 240 people had died and another 120 were still missing.
He said the party had suspended its political activities in Punjab due to flood situation.
He praised the KP government and the armed forces for their role in the rescue efforts in the province.
He, however, termed the assistance so far provided by the federal government “insufficient”.
PPP’s Naveed Qamar urged collective national action against climate change and environmental mismanagement.
The PPP leader warned that floods could be 22pc more destructive next year, while in the long term, melting glaciers might dry up the Indus and other rivers, turning fertile lands into deserts and threatening centuries-old ecosystems.

• Seeks loan, electricity bill waivers for flood-hit farmers
• Says PM has assured him of help for affected people
• Accuses India of violating Indus treaty by withholding flood data
KASUR: As floods continue to batter Punjab and severely impact farmers, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday urged both the federal and provincial governments to declare an
agricultural emergency
in the province.
The PPP leader visited the flood-hit Talwar Post in Kasur, on the border with India, met affected families and later spoke to the media.
According to statement, Mr Bhutto-Zardari also telephoned Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and briefed him on the problems being faced by farmers across Punjab.
He told the premier that the floods had caused severe damage to the agriculture sector and said the Centre must play its role in helping farmers.
According to a readout of the call issued by the PPP, PM Shehbaz assured Mr Bhutto-Zardari that the government would take all possible steps to help the disaster-stricken farmers of Punjab.
The PPP leader also demanded that electricity bills of farmers in disaster-hit  districts be waived, while the repayment of agricultural loans should  either be delayed or written off.
He also proposed cash transfers  to the affected farmers through the Benazir Income Support Programme  (BISP), as was done in the wake of previous floods.
In the aftermath of the catastrophic floods in 2010 and 2011, the government  had partnered with international donors to roll out cash grant  programmes through the Watan Card and Pakistan Card schemes.
Their  success was eventually replicated with the BISP programme, which has  since won international acclaim for its effectiveness in augmenting  poverty alleviation efforts.
In Kasur, the PPP chairman heard the grievances of farmers and stressed that the federal and provincial governments should work together to provide relief to the affected people.
The PPP will stand with the provincial government during the relief  and reconstruction phases, he said, adding that no single government  can cope with a calamity of this scale. Speaking at Talwar Post, Mr Bhutto-Zardari accused India of violating the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and withholding flood-related information from Pakistan.
He said that in doing so, India had forgotten basic humanity.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari praised Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for making efforts to provide relief to
people displaced
by the floods, and stressed the need to stand shoulder to shoulder with farmers.
The PPP chairman also directed his party workers to take an active part in relief activities and assured the affected families that his party would not abandon them.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari was received by senior PPP leader Chaudhry Manzoor Ahmed during his visit to Kasur. The PPP chairman was accompanied by Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider, former National Assembly speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Hasan Murtaza, Nadeem Afzal Chan and Qamar Zaman Kaira.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945628/sc-declares-ihc-order-barring-justice-jahangiri-from-judicial-work-null-and-void,SC declares IHC order barring Justice Jahangiri from judicial work ‘null and void’ - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"The Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday declared Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) Sept 16 decision to bar Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri from judicial work “null and void”, a day after the apex court ordered the decision’s suspension.
Yesterday, the court adjourned the hearing to September 30 (today) and issued notices to all the respondents, as well as the Attorney General of Pakistan  (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, to appear before the court.
On September 16, the IHC had restrained Justice Jahangiri from exercising his judicial powers as a two-judge bench issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution. Justice Jahangiri then challenged the decision in the SC, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside.
The matter centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
Resuming the hearing today, the five-member Constitutional Bench — headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan — took up Justice Jahangiri’s petition.
AGP Awan appeared before the court and said, “A judge cannot be barred from judicial work through an interim order.“
At this, Justice Aminuddin asked respondent Mian Daud, who had filed the original petition against Justice Jahangiri, for his opinion. In response, Daud said: “I hold the same opinion — a judge cannot be stopped from judicial work.”
He added that “an order barring a judge from their duties can not be defended.”
Noting the AGP’s statement and that of other relevant parties, Justice Aminuddin set aside the IHC order, ruling that a judge can not be stopped from carrying out judicial duties.
The CB, while referring to the SC registrar’s office objections regarding the petition against Justice Jahangiri in the IHC, directed the court to “first decide on the objections in the writ petition.”
During the hearing, the matter of the maintainability of the writ petition came under discussion as Justice Jahangiri’s legal counsel, Munir Malik, addressed the court and said, “according to yesterday’s court order, it was written that the writ is maintainable, but in my opinion, only the SJC can take action against a judge.”
At yesterday’s hearing, the CB had made it clear that it would only examine the Sept 16 restraining order and not the main petition questioning Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
“No one should be under the impression that we have accepted the high court’s jurisdiction to hear the writ petition,” he added, referring to the Malik Asad Ali case.
To this, Justice Aminuddin responded: “We have written in the order only the language that is present in the Malik Asad Ali case.”
In his remarks, Justice Mandokhel said, “We have only maintained that a judge may only be removed by the SJC.”
Justice Mazhar asserted that, “We are not touching on the question of the maintainability of the writ of quo warranto. Whether it merited a hearing in a high court is up to the relevant high court to decide.
“The only question before us is whether a judge can be prevented from working through an interim order,” he said, stressing that the CB at the moment “will not address the question of whether a writ petition can be filed against a judge.”
“Both the Supreme Court and High Court judges are not office holders, Justice Mandokhel observed, but then went on to say that “all of these things can be discussed when the case is heard on merit.”
“We do not want to go on merit in the present case,” he said.
On Monday, the SC
suspended
the order issued by the IHC barring Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial duties in a case pertaining to his law degree allegedly being fake.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
, the bench ruled that the “operation of the impugned order is suspended”.
Meanwhile, the Sindh High Court (SHC) is set to
hear
a petition filed by Justice Jahangiri today, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.
Justice Jahangiri has impugned the decisions of University of Karachi’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate, which cancelled his degree in August last year.
The IHC judge recently approached the SHC, but at the time of filing, the court’s additional registrar (writ) raised several objections, including questions about the maintainability of the petition and the delay in filing it.
Fake degree controversy
The controversy began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the KU’s examinations, regarding the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, leading to the subsequent
filing
of a reference with the SJC.
The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016.
It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri.
Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme.
On July 10, 2024, IHC
ruled
that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.”
As the degree accusations came to light, Daud filed a writ petition, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq
heard
the petition filed by the lawyer.
At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that Daud was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC.
On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU
cancelled
Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its UFM Committee, varsity officials said.
The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was
picked up
by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree.
Then, on Sept 5 2024, the SHC
suspended

On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ  Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the SC.

attack
on Hama’s negotiators in Qatar.
Speaking at a protest in the provincial capital, JI’s Peshawar Ameer Bahrullah Khan advocate said Hamas had already shattered Israel and accused Israel of
carrying out
two years of “systematic killings” of women, children, and civilians in Gaza and Palestine and condemned the United States and the United Nations for failing to act.
“It is a shame for all global powers that speak of human rights but remain silent over the Palestinians genocide,” Mr Khan said in a statement issued from Markaz-i-Islami.
The speakers during the protest demonstration said that Hamas, despite being poorly armed, humiliated Israel and its allies, praising the Hamas leaders, mothers, and even children who sacrificed their lives.
They said that Hamas had agreed to meet in Qatar to consider the US proposal for a ceasefire but during talks, Israel launched missile strikes, allegedly backed by the Americans.
“This attack was not only against Hamas but against diplomacy, humanity, and peace itself,” said Hafiz Hameedullah.
Hamas, they warned, had vowed to continue its resistance. “Even if Israel kills a thousand of our leaders, our struggle will not stop,” said another JI leader Tariq Mateen.
The demonstration was called by JI emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman. Similar protests were held across the country.
JI held protests against Israeli attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar
CHARSADDA:
The Jamaat-e-Islami also organised a protest demonstration at Farooq Azam Chowk Charsadda against the attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar.
The protesters, holding placards and banners, chanted slogans of “Death to Israel and America”. They strongly criticised the American support to Israel, saying that Israel’s history is full of atrocities and barbarity, but the world powers, especially the United States, are openly supporting it.
The protest was addressed by Jamaat-e-Islami’s acting district emir Shah Zaman Durrani, general secretary Fawad Ahmed, Al-Khidmat Foundation president Saddam Hussein, Pir Masood Jan, Haroon Khan, Abdul Rehman and others.
The speakers said that atrocities being committed against the unarmed Palestinian people are inhumane. They strongly condemned Israel’s attacks on the Hamas office in Qatar, in which several key Hamas leaders were martyred. They demanded of the international community to intervene immediately stop the Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people..
HARIPUR:
Nominating US president Trump for Nobel Prize is worst form of slavery as the Americans were abetting the Israeli terrorism against innocent Gazans. This was stated by Tahir Atiq Sidiqi, district emir of Jamaat- i- Islami, while addressing a protest rally to condemn the Israeli attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar.
Accusing the US president of being hand in gloves with Israel in the history’s worst genocide of Palestinian Muslims, Mr Sidiqi said that nominating Trump for Nobel Prize by Pakistani government was tantamount to supporting the oppression against the innocent Muslims in Gaza.
He also exhorted the COAS Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir to use his influence for the protection of Muslim Ummah. Qazi Tanzeel ur Rehman, Maulana Shafiul Haq, Ashraf Awan and Qazi Wajaat advocate were prominent among those who spoke to the protesters.
BATTAGRAM:
In response to Israel forces on Hamas leadership in Qatar, the Battagram chapter of the JI organised a protest gathering on the Karakoram Highway at Khatm-i-Nabuwat Chowk to denounce the attack on the Hamas leaders during a dialogue session.
The protesters carrying placards and banners with slogans against Israel and America termed Israel a “terrorist and rogue state.”
Anwar Baig, the district emir of Jamaat-i- Islami, strongly condemned the attack, describing it a cowardly act.  Khalid Khan, president of the Al-Khidmat Foundation, highlighted the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where children, women, and men are dying due to starvation as Israel has blocked aid routes. He criticised America for ignoring the situation despite its claims of championing human rights.

Afghan nationals
, detained in Afghan Holding Centre, were deported to their country on Tuesday, while two others were shifted to Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH) due to their health problem amid tight security.
According to sources, nearly 50 illegal Afghan nationals, including 21 male, eight female and 20 children, picked up by law enforcement officials from different parts of the twin cities had been waiting in the holding centre while their travel documents for deportation to Afghanistan were being prepared.
Ever since the government deadline for their voluntary repatriation expired on August 31, the law enforcement authorities had launched a crackdown on Afghan nationals who possessed Proof of Registration (PoR) cards.
A security official said after the deadline ended, the remaining Afghan nationals have been facing arrest and forced expulsion.
Pakistan had extended the deadline for the deportation of millions of Afghan refugees holding PoR cards to September 1, and a large number of Afghan families residing in Rawalpindi voluntarily repatriated.
As part of the illegal foreigner repatriation strategy, a joint ‘subcommittee’ (JSC) of police and intelligence officers was formed to map Afghan nationals with Proof of Registration cards and help operational teams.
The JSC comprised district officer Special Branch Rawalpindi, deputy superintendent of police security Rawalpindi as well as representative of Ministry of Safron, Counter-Terrorism Department, Intelligence Bureau and other agencies.
The government has already chalked out a comprehensive strategy to expedite formal repatriation of Afghan nationals holding PoR cards as part of the ongoing implementation of the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
The repatriation of illegal foreign nationals, including Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders will continue as per the earlier decision under the IFRP.
Since the government’s deadline passed, more than 3,575 illegal Afghan nationals, including 2,034 male, 663 female and 881 children, have been rounded up by the law enforcement authorities and brought to the Afghan Holding Centre Dhoke Syedan in Rawalpindi.

sale
of the national carrier later this year.
The PIA, part of the PIA Holding Company, recorded a pre-tax profit of Rs11.5 billion ($40.64 million) in the six months to June, compared with the same period in 2024 when it remained in a loss before taxes and only managed a rare annual profit through deferred tax adjustments. Net profit for the current half year stood at Rs6.8bn.
The disclosure comes as Islamabad presses ahead with a fresh attempt to privatise the airline, a key condition under Pakistan’s $7bn IMF
bailout.
A company source said it was the state-run airline’s first such profit since 2004. Financial records before 2014 are no longer publicly available on the airline’s and the stock exchange’s websites.
The planned sale of the PIA would mark the country’s first major privatisation in about two decades, with divestment of loss-making state firms a central plank of last year’s bailout.
Lucrative UK routes
High fuel and service costs continue to weigh, but a steep drop in finance costs after Islamabad assumed about 80 per cent of the PIA’s legacy debt last year was a decisive factor in its return to profit. Despite the gain, the PIA’s equity remains negative, underscoring the fragility of its turnaround.
A previous privatisation attempt collapsed last year after a single lowball offer was received, but the government has since
drawn
interest from five domestic business groups, including Airblue, Lucky Cement, investment firm Arif Habib and Fauji Fertiliser. Final bids are expected
later
this year.

lifted
in July a five-year ban on Pakistani airlines
imposed
after a fatal 2020
crash
and a pilot licensing scandal, allowing the PIA to reapply for lucrative UK routes. The move follows similar steps by the European Union late last year.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940374,Footprints: AMIDST FLOOD  & FERTILITY - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"As news channels flashed images of
swollen rivers
round the clock, a young Zubair Hajjano appeared calm, tending to his cattle in the Indus riverine area, colloquially known as the ‘katcha’.
His livestock grazing at a distance inside the main dyke of the river was his only concern. The main dyke that covers a certain mileage of Hyderabad and Matiari districts is located downstream of Sukkur and the area here provides ample land for crops as well as grazing grounds for cattle. “Pani aaye ga tu dekhey gey (We will worry once the floodwater arrives),” Zubair said smilingly when asked if he had an idea about when floodwaters from the Sukkur barrage would reach the
katcha area
. He looked somewhat uninterested in talking about the anticipated flood, unlike other members from his community.
At a distance, a separate group of Hajjano men were sitting underneath an acacia tree before returning to their village located across Ghalyan Bund — a 13-mile-long dyke starting from Matiari to the Jamshoro front bund. Acacia trees are a common sight in Sindh’s katcha area on both sides of the river within its two dykes, whose construction began by the British when they started building Sukkur in 1930s.
Unlike Zubair, Sajjad and Zaheer were a bit more cautious, whom I met about 1km beyond the main dyke. Amid all the hullabaloo about super floods, they were making their own assessments about the incoming deluge daily. Their quest to predict the floods was guided by indigenous knowledge.
Unruffled Indus riverine area dwellers rely on indigenous methods to prepare for deluge
“Water gradually rises on a daily basis when floodwaters enter the area,” Sajjad explained. He pointed towards a manmade bank of a drain, called Chandhan, that brings effluent from Matiari located on the left bank of the Indus downstream of Sukkur. The drain’s outfall is inside the riverine area, touching the Ghalyan Bund in the Hyderabad district.
“When flows increased last month, the water had touched this drain’s bund…before it receded, leaving its mark behind,” he recalled, alluding to a brief high flood of 510,798 cusecs in Guddu downstream on Aug 24’s afternoon. The barrage attained a medium flood level of 477,864 cusecs at 6pm the same day.
“I check a certain stone or a piece of wood to see whether it is soaked or drowned. If the surface shows some dried surface, then it means the levels are still lower than expected. The next morning, I repeat the exercise again…” a complacent Zaheer added.
“For our communities, different landmarks serve as determinants of floods’ arrival,” said Chakar Chalgari, an irrigation department employee. Ahmed Ali Chalgari, another resident, agrees with him. “The month of August is a harbinger of floods for us. We do maintain benchmarks inside the area. For instance, I will keep checking some plants like devi — wild vegetation — in the area to have an idea of increasing river flows”.
The Hajjano community lives in the Bodhani village across Ghalyan Bund, feeding off the riverine land. Many of them own small pieces of land for agricultural purposes, while others work as peasants managing the lands of influential landlords. These large tracts of land are, by and large, owned by those having political connections or government backing, and they either have direct land ownership or have occupied massive forestlands. Successive orders by the Sindh High Court a couple of years back led to the retrieval of encroached forest land and entry in revenue record.
Katcha economy
The katcha area — infamous for its bandits — is actually the region’s breadbasket due to its rich soil. Various streams flow from the Indus to water these farmlands, with several protected by private embankments. Landowners build these private bunds, called zamindari bund, around their lands to protect them against floods, but if the Indus has very high or super floods, like in 2010, these are washed away.\
The riverine area contributes to the country’s food security to a great degree, producing grain and other crops. Kharif crops, like cotton, and winter crops like wheat, pulses, gram and vegetables, are grown here besides the large-scale sugarcane cultivation. A previous visit in 2021 revealed a mindboggling scale of cane cultivation inside the katcha area.
A Board of Revenue document showed that Sindh’s katcha land and river island spanned an area of 977,527 acres (3,697 square kms); 3pc of Sindh’s total land i.e. 34,820,640 acres (140,914 sq kms).
Katcha dwellers pay 50pc of dhal (revenue charges) when compared with their settled area farmers. Abiyana (water charges) are not recoverable from them, as they are not dependent on regular irrigation supplies.
“Output from the katcha area is part of the overall production of grain and other crops in Sindh,” informed Agriculture Extension DG Munir Jumani. He said the recent flooding downstream of Guddu and Sukkur, however, damaged sugarcane, cotton and vegetables.
For the locals, if inundation becomes evident, then they move out with their livestock and wait for the water to recede.
In the
2010 floods
, water flows had hit this dyke. In July of that year, officials had not expected floodwaters would inundate gauges — usually installed along every river dyke to record historic flows — at the Ghalyan dyke. This super flood still haunts the dwellers.
Wahid Magsi, who actually hails from Jhalg Magsi, said it was water everywhere, forcing them to settle atop this embankment. These floods proved to be the most destructive for Sindh, displacing millions and washing away hundreds of cattle heads.

submerged
vast swathes in south Punjab, the tehsils of Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur have become epicenters of an emerging humanitarian crisis, with over 1.4 million people affected by the calamity.
In Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil, around 700,000 people have been affected by the flood as most of its union councils have been submerged. A drone camera footage shows floodwater inundating around 35km to 40km area of the tehsil.
As most of the villages and settlements have lost land connection, the government is also using helicopters for the evacuation of the people still trapped in the floodwater, awaiting help, sitting on the rooftops of their houses.
The tehsil headquarters gives the look of a haunted town abandoned by most of its residents who evacuated to safe places, leaving their homes.
A town resident, Sohail Baloch, points out that the lack of potable water was also a reason forcing the residents to leave their houses. He says that water from the riverbed was a major source, as the underground water in the area is saline and can’t be used for drinking and cooking.
Many in the two flood-hit south Punjab tehsils await evacuation, relief goods
He says that water from the river used to be filtered by the water plants to make it potable, but due to the suspension of electricity, these filtration plants have been rendered dysfunctional.
He adds that around 95 percent of the shops and stores in Jalalpur Pirwala city have been closed, fearing the flood. Piles of earth could be seen in front of many shops, which have been dumped to block the floodwater, he says.
He says that those sitting on the rooftops of their houses in the flooded areas are also not safe, as these structures are collapsing because of remaining in the floodwater for a week.
Baloch says that before the Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s visit to Jalalpur Pirwala, there was an acute shortage of rescue boats and the owners of private boats were charging the flood-hit people for evacuation at their will.
He says that on the CM’s orders, additional boats have been provided for the evacuation of people, while private boats have also been hired for the purpose by the district administration.
As no mobile phone network is functional in the flood-affected areas of the tehsil, the trapped people can’t call anyone for rescue, he adds. However, he says, the situation improved after the CM’s visit as she ordered search operations in the flood-affected areas of the tehsil to evacuate trapped people. The administration is also using four helicopters for relief and evacuation in the area, he adds.
He says the union councils which have been completely submerged include Durabpur, Kotla Chakar, Norraja Bhutta, Khan Bela, Bait Kech Shumali and Janobi, Mochi Panohan, Vicha Sandheela, Mohana Sandheela, Phairani, Bait Mughal and Patan Miayni.
A flood-affected resident, Majid Zahoor, told
Dawn
that people were evacuating on their own before the CM’s visit and private boat operators were charging them heavily. “The operators were charging up to Rs10,000 to Rs15,000 per person to transport them to safe place,” zahoor says, adding that Rs10,000-Rs20,000 per cattle head was being charged by these unscrupulous boat owners.
He says as the floodwater entered his village, people had to run for their lives, leaving their household items on the rooftops. He says many had to leave their cattle heads in the floodwater.
Zahoor says that thieves using private boats were stealing the belongings left by the flood-hit residents, including fridges, washing machines and solar panels.
He says five people of his village had gone missing in the floodwater and rescuers were searching for them.
Meanwhile, the 50 percent of the 760,000-strong population of Alipur tehsil has been affected by the flood.
Local sources say that several union councils in the tehsil were submerged three days ago when the Panjnad Headworks received its first major surge last week. The situation worsened further with the second surge that is passing through the headworks, they add.
The submerged areas include Seetpur, Khan Garh Doma, Tibbi Arain, Sarki, Kotla Ghulam Shah, Kotla Bakhsh, Pepalwala, Phalwala, Langarwah, Khairpur, Missan Kot, Bait Nabi Shah, Ghalwan-II, Bait Mullan Wali, Azamatpur, Chowki Gabol, Chuttaywala, Wasti Mahsar, Wasti Gopang, Kundrala, Gulshan-e-Rasool, Damarwala Janobi, Lashkariwala, Mehanwala, Hassanwala, Bakhowala, Lalwala and Basti Lashri.
They say thousands of people are sitting on the bank of Chandar Bahan Nala without any help as the government has established only four relief camps in different schools of the tehsil.
Dodal Khan of Azmatpur told
Dawn
that he had lost 15 of his cattle heads to the flood that hit his village. He says that two cows of his sister also drowned in the floodwater and they were fending for themselves without any government help.
He says that the government officials only made announcements through the mosques, warning of the approaching floodwater, but did not provide any transport to people for evacuation.
He says his brother had to pay Rs10,000 per cattle head to a private boat’s owner to transport his livestock to a safe location.
He rubbishes the claims of the district and provincial administrations about provision of rescue boats and relief camps to the flood-hit people. “My family is living in the house of a relative and they are looking after them.”

• High alert along Sutlej as official warns of more flows from India
• PDMA estimates over 3m people displaced; minister announces Rs2m compensation for families of the slain
• PM orders climate change ministry to start preparing for next monsoon
LAHORE: Although a major surge, exceeding 600,000 cusecs in the River Chenab, has crossed Multan and Muzaffargarh without incident, the threat from surging waters has not yet subsided, as more rains are expected to disrupt rescue and rehabilitation work, and bring more water to Punjab’s already swollen rivers.
A major wave crossed the Head Muhammadwala and Sher Shah Bridges and is now advancing towards Panjnad Headworks, where it is expected to peak at 600,000 cusecs by tonight (Saturday), a senior irrigation department official told
Dawn
.
The episode reveals the complex interplay of Punjab’s river systems. In the River Ravi, water levels at Sidhnai Headworks only began receding after the flood pressure in the Chenab subsided near their convergence point at Abdul Hakeem.
For a tense 36 hours, Sidhnai faced one of its most severe tests as the extremely high flood in the Chenab created a virtual wall of water, blocking the Ravi’s flow and causing it to flow backward, dramatically increasing pressure on the headworks.
To avert a disaster, the government was forced to carry out a strategic breach at the Mai Safura embankment three days ago to relieve this pressure.
The river flow report released by PDMA Punjab shows that while overall water levels are high, but flows have generally stabilised.
Multan Deputy Commissioner Wasim Hamid Sindhu said that the intensity of floodwaters in the Chenab was decreasing.
He said that water levels reaching Head Muhammad Wala Bridge, Basti Jhagunwala, Akbar embankment, Sikanderi Nallah and Sher Shah were decreasing and the reading on the emergency gate at Akbar embankment had falled from 414 to 413.5.
He said that the water level in the Chenab was expected to decrease over the next 12 hours, adding that Head Muhammad Wala or the Sher Shah embankment would not be bre­ached.
Threat from impending rain
Addressing a press conference in Gujranwala, Provincial Disaster Man­agement Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that another incoming rain spell was expected to disrupt ongoing rescue operations across flood-affected regions. He said that after yet another high-flood warning from India at the Harike location, the government had placed all districts along the Sutlej River on high alert.
DG Kathia warned that fresh rainfall would create additional difficulties for those already affected by the floods.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has already warned officials in Punjab, Sindh and Islamabad to remain alert for a spell forecast from Sept 7-9. According to the NDMA, a low-pressure system is currently located over Madhya Pradesh (India) and likely to move west-northwest, may reach Rajasthan and adjoining parts of Sindh today. Under the influence of this weather system, Punjab, Sindh and Islamabad may face heavy to very heavy rains.

Speaking at the tail-end of the National Assembly sitting on Friday, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said that so far, 2.1 million people had been displaced by the floods.
He termed it a massive disaster that was not easy to cope with, adding that meteorological predictions had been correct with a 92pc accuracy rate.
He revealed that the families of those who lost their lives due to the floods would be given Rs2m in compensation, adding that Rs680m had been paid to families of those killed and injured so far.
Separately, PDMA Punjab issued a report on damages caused by flooding in Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab rivers, which stated that over 3,900 villages had been affected. The report put the figure of those affected by the floods at 3.89m.
Around 1.84m people trapped in floodwaters have been relocated to safety, while 1.34m animals had been relocated.
According to Punjab Relief Com­missioner Nabil Javaid, the reservoirs at Mangla and Tarbela are at 87pc and 100pc capacity, respectively. Meanwhile, India’s Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej River is at 84pc, the Pong Dam is at 98pc, while the Thein Dam is 92pc full.
PM orders prep for next monsoon
Separately, chairing a high-level review meeting to assess the damage, as well as the ongoing rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts underway across the country, PM Shehbaz Sharif ordered the Ministry of Climate Change to begin immediate preparations for the 2026 monsoon season and present a comprehensive climate resilience action plan within two weeks.
The plan, he said, must address Pakistans growing vulnerability to climate change. The PM stressed the need for real-time monitoring of evacuation and relief operations to ensure that timely assistance reaches those in need. He instructed the establishment of a special committee to facilitate financial assistance for flood victims who are not currently registered with Nadra.
The meeting was informed that compensation for deceased persons, the injured, and property damages was being processed through Nadra, with priority being given to those most affected.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941050/ihc-seeks-record-of-land-allotted-to-private-educational-institutions,IHC seeks record of land allotted to private educational institutions - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday directed the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to provide a complete record of land allotted to
private educational institutions
in the federal capital, while hearing a petition against the transfer of a prime government plot to a private school operator.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas issued the order during proceedings on a petition filed by the Federal Government Schools Teachers Association.
The teachers’ body had challenged the allotment of a 21-kanal plot in Sector F-11/2, valued at nearly Rs20 billion, which had originally been designated for a government primary school but was later earmarked for an upscale private institution.
According to the petition, the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) in 2023 entered into an agreement with a private firm to establish a high-end school on the plot. The move drew strong criticism from teachers, who argued that the land was meant for a government-run facility providing free education to children in line with the constitutional guarantee under Article 25-A.
Teachers’ body questions transfer of 21 kanals worth Rs20bn govt plot to private school
Appearing before the court, petitioner’s counsel Kashif Ali Malik contended that the state is constitutionally obligated to provide free and compulsory education to all school-going children. “The FDE, instead of fulfilling its mandate, is surrendering its land to a private entity which will only serve a privileged class,” he argued.
He added that the CDA rules and the Islamabad Land Disposal Regulations contain clear criteria for the allotment of plots to educational institutions, which in this case had been overlooked.
Justice Minhas noted that the Public-Private Partnership Authority Act elaborates on the procedures for such arrangements and advised the petitioner’s counsel to prepare arguments in the context of this law. The hearing was adjourned until September 26.
The controversy has revived debate over the government’s education priorities and the role of private schools in Islamabad. In recent decades, CDA has allotted land to private schools at nominal rates, yet many of these institutions charge exorbitant fees that place them beyond the reach of ordinary families. In case of the proposed F-11 school, the management has reportedly promised to admit 20 per cent of students free of cost, though critics argue that such assurances are rarely implemented in spirit.
Documents submitted to the court reveal that the FDE’s Planning Directorate had written to the CDA on July 10, 2023, seeking possession of the F-11 plot.
The letter, signed by FDE Planning Director Inam Jahangir and approved by the director general, stated that the Ministry of Education’s Departmental Development Working Party had already approved the project under a pilot initiative for ‘Establishment of Schools at Multiple Locations of ICT on Public-Private Partnership Mode of Investment’. The F-11/2 school was identified as the first in the series.
The teachers opposing the move say that the decision undermines the principle of universal education and risks deepening inequality in access to schooling.
“Public resources are being diverted to serve private interests,” said a representative of the association, outside the courtroom. “This land was meant for free primary education, not for elite institutions that charge tens of thousands in monthly fees.”
The case has attracted attention from education activists who argue that Islamabad already faces a shortage of government schools, particularly in newly-developed sectors.
According to official estimates, thousands of children remain out of school in the capital, despite constitutional guarantees and repeated commitments by successive governments to universalise primary education.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942237/imran-wants-to-break-tradition-of-forming-govt-on-crutches-salman-raja,Imran wants to break tradition of forming ‘govt on crutches’: Salman Raja - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf secretary general Salman Akram Raja says Imran Khan’s refusal to bow before any force is a testament that he wants to break the tradition of forming government on (establishment’s) crutches.
“We won’t take anybody’s support,” asserted Mr Raja while speaking at a news conference where he highlighted Commonwealth observers’
report
on Pakistan’s general election and launched a white paper, “Healing Punjab – Healthcare Reforms, Reversals and the Road to Recovery” authored by Dr Yasmin Rashid and co-authored by Shayan Bashir at the Lahore Press Club on Monday.
He said the Commonwealth’s investigative team’s report had exposed the fraud election and forming of the government before the world. While reading some excerpts from the report, Mr Raja said the Commonwealth found that there was a massive overwriting and change of vote figures in Form-45 and Form-46 in favour of the government parties’ candidates.
“The changed election results had let the government parties’ candidates win in at least 90 to 95 national assembly constituencies,” he claimed and added that the PTI had filed election petitions but they were yet to be taken up by the courts.
He said the Commonwealth had also referred to the Pattan Development Organisation’s report on his NA-128 constituency and Dr Yasmin Rashid vs Nawaz Sharif’s NA-129 constituency, which gave the turnout of voters for NA seat at 95pc and for provincial assembly seat 40pc or less.
PTI launches white paper on health sector of Punjab
Mr Raja also said the PTI would not accept any constitutional amendment until this fraud election would be reversed and added the PTI would restore the Constitution in its original form.
Answering a question, Mr Raja said the party’s parliamentarians were leaving National Assembly and Senate committees on the instruction of Imran Khan. Explaining the reasons, he said Sunni Ittehad Council’s chairman Hamid Raza was chairman of the Human Rights Committee but none of his ruling was implemented.
“The whole Parliament has been paralysed,” he said and added that the PTI did not want the government to boast that it was carrying opposition members in its committees.
He said the state aggression against people had always backfired and put the country on backtrack during 1958 and Yahya’s, Zia’s and Musharraf’s regimes. Now, he said, the judicial system was being used as a political ploy.
Healing Punjab white paper’s co-author Mr Bashir gave a presentation on the transformation of Punjab’s healthcare system between 2018 and 2022, its dismantling between 2023 and 2025 and the ongoing collapse exposed by the 2025 floods.
The white paper explains the PTI’s reforms built Pakistan’s first universal healthcare model and offered Rs1m annual health coverage to Punjab’s 29.3m families through the Sehat Sahulat Card. More than 900 hospitals, including 654 private facilities, were empanelled. By 2022, 4.2, families had received treatment ranging from dialysis to organ transplants. Independent surveys recorded 98pc patient satisfaction. In 2021–22 alone, the government hospitals earned more than Rs10bm in revenue through the programme.
According to the white paper, alongside financial protection, the PTI recruited more than 33,000 professionals, upgraded 42 nursing schools and trained 200 anaesthetists, making all the DHQs operational for the first time. Over 1,200 BHUs were upgraded; the PKLI became Pakistan’s first JCI-accredited public hospital and performed more than 1,700 transplants.
As the PML-N returned to power, the white paper explains, the gains were reversed. In June 2025, Sehat Card services were suspended, stripping 29m families of protection. The private hospital network shrank from 654 to 155, forcing dialysis patients to pay Rs5,500 per session. More than 2,000 BHUs were outsourced and rebranded as “Maryam Nawaz Clinics,” many without staff, medicines, or electricity. Over 12,500 maternal and child health workers were dismissed.
The report says the ongoing floods revealed the cost of this governance failure. More than two million people got displaced, 1,400 villages submerged and disease outbreaks were rising. With clinics closed, health workers dismissed, and Sehat Card coverage suspended.
“Punjab faces a public health disaster on top of a natural one,” said Mr Bashir and added “This is not just a policy report. It is a rescue plan for Punjab”.

According to a notification from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, available with
Dawn.com
, the committee has been constituted based on the Apex Committee’s meeting minutes on revising the National Action Plan from June 2024.
“The ‘National Committee on Narrative Building’ is hereby constituted on points related to information operation, formulation, dissemination, propagation and evaluation of [the] national narrative against the spread of terrorism [or] extremism through media, communication and cyber networks for smooth implementation of Revised National Action Plan 2021,” the notification read.
The 20-member body will be led by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and will be composed of the information and broadcasting secretary, information ministers from all provinces and territories, the chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority and representatives from both the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
In March, Adviser to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Information, Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif,
said
that the growing threat of violent extremism was not merely an ideological issue; countering extremism required more than just security measures and a long-term and comprehensive strategy developed with the coordination of all relevant institutions and stakeholders was required.
Islamabad chairs SCO’s anti-terror body
Pakistan has assumed the chair of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (SCO-RATS), a
press release
from the Foreign Office (FO) read on Wednesday.
This development comes on the heels of the SCO Council of Heads of State Summit in Tianjin, China, earlier this month. During the summit, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif
raised
the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) issue, while the summit released a joint declaration condemning terrorist attacks on the
Jaffar Express
and
Khuzdar
in Balochistan.
The FO’s press release highlighted that Pakistan chairing SCO-RATS was a “reflection of the SCO’s confidence in Pakistan as a contributor to regional peace and security, particularly in combating terrorism”.
“In its capacity as the Chair of SCO-RATS, Pakistan will work towards fostering regional cooperation against terrorism, in line with shared priorities, guided by the Shanghai Spirit of mutual trust, equality, and shared responsibility,” the FO stated.
“It will also host events and activities across key domains — including cyber counter-terrorism, information operations, border security, countering terrorist financing, and capacity-building — to deepen collaboration.”
The FO added that as a frontline state in combating terrorism, Pakistan continues to make sacrifices to ensure the safety and security not only of its own people but also of the region and beyond.
“As a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for the 2025–26 term, Pakistan has also been entrusted with key responsibilities in the counter-terrorism domain, among others,” the press release read.
In June this year, Pakistan was appointed vice chair of the UN Security Council’s (UNSC) Counter-Terrorism Committee, which is tasked with monitoring implementation of UNSC Resolution 1373 (2001), which requested countries to implement several measures intended to enhance their legal and institutional ability to counter terrorist activities at home, in their regions and around the world.
Pakistan’s mission to the UN called the appointment a “significant diplomatic development”.",2025-09-10,Tahir Sherani,918,0.000129

flood
in the Ravi River and the rainwater drain of Baen has started causing land erosion while dozens of villages are at risk of being submerged due to a breach in the river dyke.
Land erosion has started near village Jarmian Singha of tehsil Shakargarh and it is weakening the protective embankment of the river. Land erosion has started at two points due to rapid flow in the Nullah Baen while the erosion is increasing rapidly at the villages of Salian and Chak Nahra along the drain.
When this story was filed on Thursday, a moderate flood was passing through the Ravi, coming from India, and the rainwater drains of Baen and Basantar, coming from India-held Kashmir.
According to the irrigation department, a flood of 61,000 cusecs is passing through the Ravi at Kot Naina and 82,140 cusecs from Jassar. A flood of 4,900 cusecs is passing through the rainwater drain Basantar.
Muhammad Arsalan, a resident of village Chak Nahra, said the locals were facing massive losses due to the breach of the protective embankment of Baen. He said the residents of the village were making efforts to strengthen the dyke on their own and that tree trunks, soil and sand bags were being used to plug the erosion point. The district administration Narowal was informed about the land erosion.
Due to the flood in the Ravi on Thursday, thousands of acres of agricultural land at village Bheko Chak was under water. The Narowal-Shakargarh road was submerged with floodwater at Mandikhel and the traffic faced difficulty due to water on the road.
Vegetables, rice and fodder on 100 acres of agricultural land of a landlord in Shakargarh were washed away in a flash flood.
Muhammad Akmal Khan, a resident of village Jarmian Post, in tehsil Shakargarh, had 100 acres of agricultural land near the Pakistan-India border where he was growing bitter gourd, brinjal, mash, rice and fodder and all of them were washed away and cropland got covered by the sand of the Ravi. The flood also washed away water pumps and animal shelters of Akmal.
He told
Dawn
that the agricultural land was presenting a scene of a sea of sand.
Rana Muhammad Jahangir, the spokesman for the Gujranwala Electric Power Supply Company (Gepco), said Chief Executive Engineer Muhammad Ayub visited the flood-affected area of Zafarwal and inspected the work for the restoration of the collapsed tower of the 132kV on Pasrur-Zafarwal transmission line due to flood of the rainwater drain Dek. After the collapse of the tower, power was restored to 15 out of 16 feeders of the Zafarwal grid station through alternative sources. He said the teams had started work on an emergency basis.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940564/113mm-rain-lashes-lahore-disrupts-routine-businesses,"113mm rain lashes Lahore, disrupts routine businesses - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","LAHORE: Heavy rain lashed most of the areas of Lahore on Monday evening, inundating roads and localities and disrupting routine business. The first spell of rain started at about 4:30pm and continued non-stop for about one hour. After a gap of drizzle, the second spell of rain started at about 6:10pm and continued till 6:45.
According to the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), the city received maximum rain (113mm) till 7pm at Paniwala Talab and its surrounding localities, followed by Iqbal Town with 97mm, Jail Road 65mm, Airport 35mm, Gulberg, 77.5mm, Lakshami Chowk 96.5mm, Upper Mall 66.5mm, Mughalpura 32.5mm, Tajpura 40.5mm, Nishtar Town 79mm, Chowk Nakhuda 73.5mm, Farrakhabad 95mm, Gulshan-i-Ravi 64.5mm, Samanabad 83.5mm, Johar Town 66.5mm, Shadipura 58.5mm and Qartuba Chowk (Mozang) 67mm.
According to the Met Office, Monday’s rain in Lahore and adjoining areas is the second last spell of the ongoing monsoon.
“The last spell of monsoon will last for two days from Sept 15 to 16,” a Met official said while talking to
Dawn
. The heavy rain inundated several major roads in Gulberg, Johar Town, Mozang, Samanabad, Chowk Nakhudha, Farrukhabad, Lakshami Chowk, Railway Station, Township, Iqbal Town, Mughalpura, Tajpura, Jail Road, Gulshan-i-Ravi, the airport area and other parts of the city.
“The city’s sewerage seems inadequate to timely drain out the rainstorm water. We have been seeing this mess for last many years,” deplores a motorist while talking to
Dawn
.
“After a long time, I have seen various drainage projects being executed in Lahore these days. Let’s see what happens after completion of these projects — will they help the public in getting rid of inundating issues or not,” he argued.
The rain disrupted the electricity supply system in the provincial capital, tripping nearly 80 feeders of 11kV distribution capacity. According to a spokesperson for the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco), efforts had been made to energise the tripped feeders in a bid to ensure restoration of electricity in various localities.
The spokesperson said that at 6:16pm, the Lesco’s demand was 3,461MW. On the other hand, the Lesco management has issued an advisory, requesting the public to remain away from the poles, wires etc.
“Lahore has a combined drainage network/system that means the domestic/commercial sewage water and rainwater drain fall together into the Ravi after flowing into the main lines. Ideally, the drainage system for rainwater should be separate,” explained an official while talking to
Dawn
.
“This is why the drainage system becomes choked and takes time to be drained fully in the rain season,” he added.
On the other hand, the Lahorites, despite efforts by Wasa, continue to suffer from the continuous rain. The situation is also adding to the miseries of residents of those localities where the floodwater is already accumulated for the last many days.
“Our houses are already under floodwater and Monday’s rain has further increased level of water accumulated there for last many days,” said a flood-affected resident of the Theme Park — an illegal housing scheme where the floodwater drowned hundreds of houses completely.
He urged the government to speed up efforts to dry the area by draining out the accumulated floodwater.
THEME PARK:
The Lahore district administration, led by DC Syed Musa Raza, visited
Theme Park View housing scheme
to review the water drainage activities there.
On this occasion, he directed the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) to employ all resources to restore access of the people to the affected areas.
The DC emphasized the need for prompt action in response to complaints and warned of action on negligence in the water drainage process. To prevent dengue larva breeding, he sought fumigation after water drainage.
He also visited the new Ravi Bridge Shahdara to review the water flow in the river and relief operations. He directed all relevant departments and rescue agencies to maintain continuous monitoring and keep all machinery and equipment ready for relief operations. He urged the citizens not to pay heed to rumours.
Syed Musa Raza said timely planning and proactive measures had been ensured for public safety and the district administration and all agencies were working together as a team to prioritise public safety.

arrested
in July this year after the
murder
of a man and woman in the name of ‘honour’ in the Degari mining area of Quetta district.
A single-judge bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kasi, after hearing arguments from both sides, granted bail to Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai against surety bonds of Rs500,000. He was released following the court’s approval of the bail application.
Earlier, police had arrested Sardar Satakzai on the allegation that, as a tribal chief, he had endorsed through a jirga the killing of the woman and the man. Acting on the jirga’s order, the woman’s brother opened fire on his 40-year-old sister, Bano Bibi, in the presence of a large number of people from the area. At the same time, the man, Ehsanullah, was also killed at the same place.
The incident came to light after a video of the firing went viral on social media more than a month after the killings had taken place. Police launched an investigation and arrested several people, including Sardar Sherbaz Khan Satakzai.
So far, police have arrested 17 people in connection with the case, including Bano Bibi’s
mother
and another brother. The mother was later released on bail. However, the main accused, who shot and killed his own sister, has not yet been arrested.

“On the instructions of SSP Malir, special teams are working to investigate every aspect of the incident on technical grounds,” the spokesperson added.
“The SSP Malir has also formed joint special teams of the police for the early arrest of the accused, which are investigating every aspect of the incident meticulously.”
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has issued orders to the inspector-general of police for the immediate arrest of the killers, according to a notice issued by the CM House today.
“The murderers of transgender persons should be arrested at all costs, and a report should be submitted to me,” the chief minister instructed.
“Transgender persons belong to the oppressed section of society that we all have to respect and honour. The state will not tolerate the killing of any oppressed and innocent citizen,” he added.
A spokesperson added that the chief minister had sought details of the incident.
Karachi’s deputy mayor, Salman Abdullah Murad, contacted the SSP seeking an inquiry report on the murders and demanding the killers’ arrest.
“The murder of three transgender persons in Memon Goth is shocking,” Murad said. “Those involved … should be arrested and given the strictest punishment.”
Although exact figures are not available due to severe underreporting, human rights groups such as Amnesty International say there has been a concerning rise in violence against trans people in Pakistan.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939558/kalabagh-again,Kalabagh again - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s
support
for the dead Kalabagh dam project has stirred up a
storm
. His endorsement of the dam runs contrary to popular public opinion not just in Sindh and Balochistan but also in his own province.
Ostensibly contingent on addressing provincial reservations to the
controversial
hydropower project on the Indus, his support for the dam — opposed by the provincial assemblies of Sindh, KP and Balochistan in the not so distant past — has baffled his own party as well. PTI leaders from KP and Sindh quickly
disowned
his statements. Asad Qaiser said that Mr Gandapur’s statement did not reflect the party’s policy. “The party has always made it clear that there should not be any controversial project. At the moment, there is a need to strengthen the federation,” he said. Haleem Adil Sheikh called the proposal a “dead horse”, which the PTI never supported. The PPP, through Nisar Khuhro, reminded Mr Gandapur that three provinces had already closed the door on Kalabagh.
The irony, however, is that the PML-N’s government in Punjab — often viewed by other federating units as the force behind the project — found itself in rare agreement with Mr Gandapur, with its information minister rushing to countersign the CM’s reckless grandstanding on behalf of her party. It exposes deep provincial fault lines: what is seen as a necessity in Punjab is viewed as a sell-out by the other provinces.
Mr Gandapur’s support for the Kalabagh dam comes on the heels of a plea from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during a recent visit to flood-hit
Narowal
district, for a consensus on new water reservoirs to fight the challenges of climate change and deal with the
recurring floods
.
While the move to bring up Kalabagh dam again risks opening old wounds, the cry for new reservoirs underpins how deeply our power elites are stuck in old, redundant concepts. As if we needed it, the effort to revive a defunct project is proof that our rulers are not capable of thinking beyond brick-and-mortar solutions to our worsening climate challenges. Is this because of lack of imagination or due to the massive money involved in such schemes, or both?
Pakistan, which is among the top 10 countries
most vulnerable
to the impact of climate change, desperately needs solutions to its problems of water shortages and droughts, devastating floods, erosion of the Indus delta, which is displacing local communities, and so on. These issues cannot be resolved by stopping the river flows through dams.
At a time when Pakistan needs unity more than ever, with floods wreaking devastation in several parts of the country and an economy on the brink, it is crucial that our rulers started to think beyond brick-and-mortar structures — if, indeed, they want to solve our increasing climate-related challenges.

flooding
in their localities as most of the water receded on Friday.
A rug hangs out to dry from a balcony of a home. Grey clouds still cover the sky but life carries on as usual in Saadi Town. Just a couple of days ago, the houses here looked like water-locked islands.
“The water did not enter our houses. Since this is not that old a town, the houses are built quite above the roads so we were fine, despite being marooned,” Babar Mirza, resident of Saadi Town, Block 7, told
Dawn
.
Even though the water has receded, it has left the roads in bad shape with an uneven surface, cracks and potholes. But the wild grass and weeds in vacant plots are lush green from the rain. They provide distraction from the moisture stains on brick walls.
Communities in Scheme 33 say their expensive residential town ‘turns into a katchi abadi’ when it rains
Saadi Town, Pir Zaman Town, Saadi Gardens and all other townships were submerged, according to the residents. The water spared none of them. They were all in the same boat.
“It was alright. I have lived in Saadi Town for some 22 years now. We have been through this before,” said Majida Bibi, another resident. She said they were prepared for that this time. “Our pantries were well-stocked as we had only recently shopped for the entire household at the start of the month. Even though we were trapped in our homes, we had adequate supplies to live on so there was no need to panic. And see how quickly the water receded,” she pointed out.
Haji Haroon Abdul Latif who runs a pan shop in the area said that he lived nearby at Mosamiat. “By the time I closed my shop to go home, the water level had risen to two to three feet. My motorcycle stopped in the water. But there was a mechanic I knew of not far from here, who was able to fix it,” said the pan shop owner. “We did not expect the water to recede so soon but it did thankfully,” he added.
Meanwhile, Sher Azam, who runs a footwear shop built at quite a height in one street which still had some water, smilingly shared his ordeal. “My shop is quite high from the ground, as you can see. But the water reached its highest step. Then if any vehicle passed by, the current turned the water into little tides which entered my shop. Some show boxes were ruined but thankfully I got a high table just in time to shift my stuff on it and hence save it,” he said.
“Now when most of the water has left this area with just a few streets still submerged, passers-by question me why there is still so much water here, or whether I have complained about it anywhere. This is neither my doing nor my fault,” he shrugged and frowned.
Dawn
then reached out to information secretary for Saadi Town, Saadi Garden Action Committee, Irfan Mughal, who said that flooding in the area was not as big an issue as the infrastructure.
“Our gutter lines, laid out in 1975, have collapsed. The builder tells us that it is not so as actually the lines in Safoora Goth are blocked. But then why are the gutters there not overflowing?” The resident and information secretary wondered.
He also informed that there was a makeshift storm-water drain dug out in their area which opens into the Malir River. “But it was blocked by one of the builders here while using it as a dumping site for trash. There is also a pipeline under the Superhighway with one end opening at the Northern Bypass and the other at Saadi Town. The flooding rainwater enters through it to reach Saadi Gardens and after passing through there it flows into Saadi Town. This flowing flood of water from the Northern Bypass to Saadi Town takes around seven to eight hours but no one cares to block it at any point from entering a residential area,” he complained.
“Then when we are flooded, we find the media here doing photo shoots of our plight,” he said.
“We are an expensive residential town but we turn into a katchi abadi  [shanty town] as soon as it rains heavily,” Mr Mughal regretted. “And on  top of that we are paying double residential and water taxes here as we  have to pay the builder of our township as well as the  cantonment board,” he said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1938984/man-linked-with-is-acquitted-in-terror-financing-case,Man ‘linked with IS’ acquitted in terror financing case - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday acquitted for want of evidence a man, said to be associated with the militant Islamic State group, in a case pertaining to his alleged involvement in terror financing.
Accused Abdul Malik, who had been arrested by the Counter Terrorism Department for possessing an unlicensed weapon, had allegedly disclosed during interrogation that he was associated with Daesh, the Arabic acronym for IS.
According to the prosecution, the accused had been involved in terror financing through hawala/hundi. It added that from 2019 to 2022, he had allegedly been providing funds from Karachi to facilitate the organisation’s operatives in carrying out terrorist activities.
The CTD had booked him for offences under Sections 11-N (punishment for fundraising and money laundering) and 21-I (aiding and abetment) of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
On Monday, after hearing arguments from the prosecution and defence counsel Abid Zaman and Mushtaq Ahmed Sheikh, the judge of ATC-12, who conducted the trial at the Judicial Complex inside Central Prison Karachi, acquitted Malik as the prosecution had failed to establish its case against him.
Defence counsel Zaman told
Dawn
that the court had directed the jail authorities to release the accused if he was not required in any other case.
During the trial, the counsel argued that the prosecution had failed to establish any link between his client and the alleged offence of terror financing.
Advocate Zaman added that the bank accounts allegedly used for terror financing were not in his client’s name, adding that the individuals in whose names the accounts were registered had not been made accused but were instead produced as witnesses.
He pointed out that while the prosecution claimed the accused had photographs with an IS operative in Afghanistan, he argued that a mere picture did not establish association with the group.

The discussion was held as the chief minister met with the PTI founder in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, according to adviser to the chief minister on information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif.
“Imran Khan directed the chief minister to ensure contact and negotiations with Afghanistan,” Mr Saif said in a statement.
The aide to the CM said during the meeting that lasted more than two hours, Mr Gandapur took Mr Imran into confidence about his government’s measures for peace in the province, especially the holding of tribal jirgas.
Saif says PTI founder expressed ‘full confidence’ in CM, ordered steps to accelerate movement for supremacy of law
He said that the PTI founder expressed full confidence in the chief minister.
“Mr Imran Khan was given a detailed briefing on the province’s financial situation, the next budget and the government’s measures adopted for strengthening the local economy. He expressed satisfaction with all those steps,” he said.
Mr Saif said the PTI founder called the chief minister’s adviser on finance, Muzammil Aslam, for a detailed briefing on economic matters and the next budget, and issued instructions to approach the court against the denial of a meeting with him.
He said that the two leaders also discussed the performance of provincial ministers and various departments.
“Mr Imran gave full authority to the chief minister for necessary measures,” he said.
Mr Saif said that the PTI founder issued directions to the chief minister to take necessary measures for accelerating the ongoing movement for the supremacy of the law and real freedom in the country.
He added that Mr Imran and Mr Gandapur discussed differences in the party, with the former ordering strict action against “those creating issues within the party”.
“Mr Imran Khan made it clear that there is no place in the party for those creating differences, so he issued directions to stop party members from issuing negative statements, which harmed unity in the party,” he said.
The chief minister’s adviser said that Mr Gandapur would approach the apex court against the “ban” on meetings with the PTI founder in jail.
He said that voters in KP gave the PTI the mandate to rule them, so it was extremely important to regularly hold consultative meetings with Mr Imran on governance.

enforced disappearances.
In a statement, Defence of Human Rights (DHR) — led by rights activist Amina Masood Janjua — expressed serious reservations over a performance report, released recently by the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (COIED), claiming to have disposed of an exceptionally high number of cases in a single month.
In a response to the claims, DHR said that the commission’s disposal of 103 cases in just one month was deeply concerning, as it implied that none of the matters had been given a proper hearing.
This pace suggested cases were being dismissed after just a few minutes of review, the DHR said in a statement issued on Thursday.
Such a rushed process, resulting in one-line conclusions such as, “the detenue disappeared by himself”, was unacceptable and misleading to the public.
The statement noted that as per their own records, 21 of the 103 cases disposed of were referred by DHR. The commission’s lack of due diligence is evident from the fact that it only just disposed of a case for a person, who had surfaced alive a decade ago, it noted.
The blanket conclusion that 103 individuals disappeared on their own was particularly alarming, especially when DHR possessed record of numerous cases with ample evidence of forced disappearances.
It also voiced concern over the recent trend of disposing of cases in bulk, based on what appear to be wrongful and misleading assumptions, saying that the Supreme Court’s original intent in forming this commission was to create a mechanism free from bureaucratic red tape and delays.

Six opposition political parties announced a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike earlier this week, to protest against the
suicide bombing
that targeted a Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) pu­­blic meeting at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium on Tuesday, which left
15 dead
and 38 injured.
The strike call has been given jointly by six political parties, including the BNP-M, PTI, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), National Party, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen and Jamaat-i-Islami.
While the provincial government noted in the statement that protest is a fundamental right, it warned demonstrators against blocking roads and highways.
“Strict and immediate action will be taken against those who try to obstruct the freedom of movement and routines of life of citizens,” the Balochistan Home Department warned.
“Elements who take the law into their own hands will not be tolerated under any circumstances and those who put citizens in danger through force or violence will not be forgiven.”
The statement added that nobody would be allowed to obstruct public facilities and that “strict legal action will also be taken against any attempt to affect any federal subject”.
The department declared that hospitals, public transport, fuel stations and markets will remain functional at all times and the closure of schools and medical facilities would not be tolerated.
Meanwhile, BNP-M chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal issued a video statement calling upon people to join the strike. Calling the suicide attack a “painful and tragic act”, he asked why the state did not respond to it.
“Isn’t the state responsible for this? Wasn’t it the duty of the state to protect these innocent people?” he asked. “What was their (BNP-M workers) fault? They did not pick up a gun. They did not kidnap anyone or engage in corruption. They raised the BNP flag.
“The Balochistan National Party, Pashtun Khamili Awami Party, National Party, PTI, Wahdatul Muslimin, have decided that on September 8, the Balochistan Bar will be shut down, and a mass strike will be carried out,” he added.
“My request to all the people of Balochistan, regardless of whether they are from a certain district or speak a certain language, or whether they are Baloch, Pashtun, Hazara, or settlers, is to make the strike on September 8 successful.”
Mengal said that the protest “will not affect the rulers”, but noted that the world would observe their movement.
“We want the world to know that these criminals, whoever they are and their atrocities, will be exposed,” he added. “I would like to request the people of every sect of thought to succeed in this protest and prove to the world that the people and protectors of Balochistan are alive.”",2025-09-07,Abdullah Zehri,725,0.000114

“On 13-14 September, 31
khwarij
belonging to Indian proxy
Fitna al Khwarij
were killed in two separate engagements in [the] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.
The state uses the term
Fitna al Khwarij
to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as
Fitna-al-Hindustan
to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said an IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat on the “reported presence of
khwarij
”.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the
khwarij
location, and after an intense fire exchange, 14 Indian-sponsored
khwarij
were sent to hell,” it added.
The ISPR added that another IBO was carried out in Bannu, where 17 more terrorists were killed in a gun battle.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored
khwariji
found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the ISPR stated.
On Saturday, the
ISPR said
the military had killed 45 terrorists between September 10 and 13 and 19 soldiers were martyred during these operations in KP.
Following those developments, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to continue responding to terrorism in the country with “full force”.
He said terrorists and their facilitators responsible for attacks in Pakistan were operating from the Afghan soil with the backing of India.
“The Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khwarij or stand with Pakistan,” he added.
PM Shehbaz warned that “anyone facilitating or advocating” for terrorists or “acting as proxies for India” was essentially their agent and would be “dealt with accordingly”.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an
uptick
in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In

Israel
targeted
Hamas leaders on Tuesday in strikes on the Qatari capital,
killing
five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer. The attack drew widespread international
condemnation
, including from Gulf monarchies allied with the United States, Israel’s main backer.
Attending a ministerial meeting in the Qatari capital, Dar delivered a speech where he highlighted that the frequency of meetings to discuss Israel’s activities in the region underlines “how Israel has become a persistent irritant and a danger to world peace and security”, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
Deputy PM Ishaq Dar is welcomed in Doha by Qatari officials ahead of a ministerial meeting of the Arab-Islamic summit, on September 14. — screengrab via X/ForeignOfficePk
“Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the illegal and unprovoked Israeli aggression against the brotherly State of Qatar,” Dar was quoted as saying.
“This reckless and provocative attack constitutes a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar, contrary to the fundamental principles of international law, including the UN Charter, in particular its Article 2(4) prohibiting the threat or use of force.”
Calling the attack “unwarranted, unjustified and appalling”, the foreign minister highlighted that this activity is emblematic of Israel’s rogue mindset, which disregards international law and norms.
“No state is safe from such an unhinged entity that defies all precepts of civilised behaviour, Dar stated. “The question of Israeli accountability is a test for the credibility of the global system.”
The foreign minister highlighted urgent steps that need to be taken “to safeguard the global order”:
Israel must be held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It should not be allowed to get away with attacking Islamic countries and killing people with impunity.
Creation of an Arab-Islamic task force to monitor the Israeli designs in the region and adopt effective deterrent and offensive measures in a synchronised manner to ward off Israeli expansionist designs.
Pursue the suspension of Israel’s membership in the United Nations. Following up on this step would be a clear message on seriousness by the Ummah.
Member states should actively consider implementing additional punitive measures against Israel, as a means to reinforce accountability and deter further violations of international law.
The UN Security Council must urgently demand [from] Israel, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter … an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire, release of hostages and exchange of Palestinian prisoners.
Unfettered, sustained and secure humanitarian access to all civilians in need, and the protection of aid workers, medical teams and UN personnel in the [Occupied Palestinian Territories].
The revival of a genuine and time-bound political process to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting two-state solution in accordance with international law and relevant UN and OIC resolutions.
Monday’s summit in Doha is expected to rally support for Qatar in the wake of last week’s Israeli attack targeting Hamas in the Gulf state.
A draft of the resolution that will be considered by heads of state condemned Israel’s attack as a destabilising escalation and said the states opposed Israel’s “plans to impose a new reality in the region”.
The draft, which was seen by
Reuters
, did not mention any diplomatic or economic moves against Israel. The resolution may change before the leaders meet in Doha on Monday.
The attack has prompted US-allied Gulf Arab states to close ranks, adding to strains in ties between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel, which normalised relations in 2020.
The emergency summit, bringing together members of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), began with a meeting of foreign ministers on Sunday to craft the draft resolution.
The gathering is a message that “Qatar is not alone … and that Arab and Islamic states stand by it,” Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit told the
Asharq al-Awsat
newspaper.
Dar will “lead Pakistan’s delegation to the ministerial meeting ahead of the Emergency Arab-Islamic Summit”, a statement by the FO said.
Upon arrival, the deputy PM was received by Pakistan’s Ambassador to Qatar Muhammad Aamer, Pakistan’s envoy to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and senior officials of the Qatari government.
The Arab-Islamic summit — held under the umbrella of the 57-member OIC — is expected to draw heads of state and governments, along with senior officials, from across the Muslim world. PM Shehbaz Sharif is also
set to attend
the high-level moot.
“The summit, cosponsored by Pakistan, has been convened in the wake of Israel’s airstrikes on Doha and the escalating developments in Palestine — following Israeli attempts to occupy Gaza, expand settlement activities in the occupied West Bank and forcibly displace the Palestinians,“ an FO
statement
said yesterday.
Diplomats said more than 50 OIC member states are expected to attend the Doha summit, where leaders may also weigh in on pushing Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York.
On the sidelines of the preparatory foreign ministers’ meeting, Dar today met with Egypt’s FM Dr Badr Abdelatty.
“They condemned illegal Israeli strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations, terming them blatant violations of sovereignty and international law. Both reaffirmed their unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and stressed the urgent need for unity across the Muslim ummah,” FO said in a statement.
Dar aslo with his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, on the sidelines of the meeting.
According to the FO, they strongly condemned Israel’s unprovoked strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations, terming them grave violations of sovereignty, international law, and the UN Charter.
“Both (leaders) underscored the pivotal role of the Arab League and the OIC in uniting the Muslim Ummah at this critical juncture and reaffirmed their unwavering support for the Palestinian people’s just struggle for freedom and self-determination,” the FO statement read.
Dar further met with with Malaysia’s Foreign Minister Dato’ Seri Mohamad Hasan on the sidelines of the meeting.
“They strongly condemned Israeli strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations as gross violations of sovereignty and international law,” the FO said.
“They reaffirmed unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and emphasized the vital importance of unity across the Muslim Ummah. They welcomed the Arab Islamic Summit as timely and essential for collective action at this critical juncture.”
‘Matter of grave concern’
Analysts
say
tomorrow’s Arab-Islamic summit is meant to send Israel a clear signal. Pakistan has been vocal in its criticism of Israel, especially taking the centre stage at a recent United Nations Security Council meeting, where it engaged in a
heated debate
with Israel.
“Repeated Israeli attacks against sovereign states in the region are a matter of grave concern, not only for the Muslim ummah but also for the wider international community,” FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan
told reporters
on Friday.
Following the attack, PM Shehbaz undertook a
one-day visit
to Doha, where he met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to denounce the Israeli action and show solidarity with the Gulf state.
Qatar plays a
mediation role
in Israel’s recent war on Gaza alongside the US and Egypt. It hosts the largest US base in the region, and also recently
gave
US President Donald Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet to use as his presidential plane.
For the first time in recent memory, the US joined all 15 UNSC members in
condemning
the Israeli strike during Thursday’s emergency meeting. The US has historically shielded Israel from statements of condemnation by not endorsing them, but on Thursday, it opted not to veto the joint statement.
Despite ongoing tensions, Trump on Friday
held a dinner
with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in New York.
The US president has said he was “very unhappy” about the Israeli attack on Qatar. However, earlier today, Secretary of State

road project
, the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs Division has recommended blacklisting a joint venture of the three firms, who were awarded a project by the National Highway Authority in violation of the rules.
The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (Carec) Tranche-III project was under scrutiny in several parliamentary committees for collusive practices and ghost tendering, among other irregularities in the award of the project.
The minutes of the last Senate panel meeting also recommended sending a letter to the donor Asian Development Bank to apprise them that the bids were “technically invalid and were manipulated due to the mala fide intention of the NHA officials and contractors”.
The panel also asked the Eco­nomic Affairs Division to write to the ADB within two days, informing the lender that the bids were technically invalid, besides highlighting the firms’ non-compliance with the rules.
Committee asks NHA, EAD to approach ADB, inform donor about manipulation of bidding process
The committee also directed the EAD to share the findings of the Senate panel with the inquiry committee formed by the prime minister. Earlier, the PM suspended eight senior officials of the NHA in this case.
The committee also recommended legal action against the auditor for submitting a fake report without supporting documents. It noted that the auditor submitted working papers for payments mentioned in the audit sheets without any supporting documentation, and against the arbitrator for alleged manipulation, as he had a past association with the JV partners.
The lead firm in the joint venture had been disqualified in the Carec-II project, but it was later declared eligible for Phase-III of the project, inviting parliamentary scrutiny. The committee maintained that the company in question was a non-performing firm and was involved in litigation related to the Lodhran-Multan project.
“The committee declared the bids for ADB CAREC Tranche-III (Rajanpur-DG Khan - DI Khan) Project of M/s NXCC, M/s Dyn­amic Constructors and M/s Rus­tam Associates null and void due to failure to meet the mandatory average annual turnover criteria of local partners. The auditor-submitted documents were found to be unverified and potentially fraudulent, and due process was not followed and without supporting documents and refusal from the companies for the provision of documents of ADB CAREC Tranche-III (Rajanpur-DG Khan-DI Khan) Project,” the minutes said.
The committee also asked the EAD and the NHA to submit a comprehensive report on Section I (Chakdara-Timargara) of the N-45 project in the next meeting.It also sought the necessary information regarding the rehabilitation of the Chitral Approach Road. The Senate body recommended that the EAD and the NHA recover approximately Rs1.7 billion as tax relief from the firms that participated in the Shandur-Gilgit project.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1938777/hrcp-urges-enforcement-of-article-9a-for-environmental-rights,HRCP urges enforcement of Article 9A for environmental rights - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"RAWALPINDI: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Sunday evening launched a
report
highlighting the necessity to enforce Article 9A of the Constitution to provide citizens with their right to clean air, safe drinking water, waste management, disaster preparedness and access to environmental justice.
The Constitution guarantees the fundamental right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment under Article 9A. Yet this vital right has remained absent from public debate, even as the country confronts a worsening climate and environmental crisis, said the HRCP in a statement.
Not only Pakistan is consistently
ranked
among the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, but disasters are no longer rare: flash floods, droughts, glacial lake outbursts and heatwaves are now recurring threats. Major urban centres — Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Faisalabad — remain among the world’s most polluted cities, while deforestation and biodiversity loss quietly worsen.
The report, ‘The promise of Article 9A — bridging constitutional rights and environmental governance’ provides a constitutional foundation for demanding clean air, safe drinking water, waste management, disaster preparedness, and access to environmental justice. It argues that this right obligates the state not only to refrain from harming the environment but also to protect and fulfill citizens’ rights through effective policies, infrastructure, and enforcement of environmental standards.
Among others, this  means developing transparent monitoring and reporting systems on air and water quality, strengthening judicial and policy frameworks so that Article 9A translates into practice, recognising climate justice as inseparable from social and economic equity, and building long-term resilience by aligning sustainable development with constitutional rights.
The report said the constitutional recognition of a fundamental right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is a crucial first step to tackling Pakistan’s climate vulnerability.
In the immediate future, this would command changes in law, policy, and judicial approach to ensuring the protection of this fundamental right.
The report comes up with recommendations which it said could lead to the enforcement of this constitutional right in letter and spirit.
It said the existing laws relating to environmental protection, forests, water ways, urban planning, waste management, wildlife and fisheries require an update in light of Article 9A.
Additionally, new legislation is required on an immediate basis to address overlooked facets of environmental and climatic concern.
The provincial EPAs have to be independently administered entities with no influence from other state institutions to effectively perform their functions. Local level environmental enforcement has to form the backbone of effective redressal.
At a policy level, sustainability concerns must be made the central theme of any proposed government project or state action. Any new project, proposal, or venture sought to be implemented by the concerned government must meet the requirement of providing a sustainable environment, while ensuring that nothing contained in such project, proposal, or venture infringes upon the constitutional right to a clean and healthy environment.
A central coordination entity must be established to enforce this right in the federation effectively. The current Climate Change Council established under the Climate Change Act 2017 suffers from potential constitutionality issues due to the absence of environment and climate change from the federal legislative list.

torrential rains
and surging
floods
have inundated large swaths of farmlands and destroyed ready-to-reap crops across Pakistan, triggering fears of a food crisis and inflation, the UN and growers warned on Monday.
The raging floods struck the northeastern Punjab, the country’s largest province and food basket, last week, submerging hundreds of villages, schools and health centres, washing away livestock and destroying crops, aside from killing around 50 people and triggering evacuations.
The surging floods have so far affected more than 2 million people, in addition to the evacuation of more than 700,000 people, according to official statistics.
The water is flowing further south to fall into the mighty Indus River and is feared to wreak havoc
on Sindh
in the coming days.
“This isn’t normal — yet it’s becoming the new normal. Monsoons, driven by climate change, now bring fear and devastation to communities across Pakistan,” Mo Yahya, the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator, said in a
post
on X, after visiting the flood-hit areas.
“Flooded rice fields stretch as far as the eye can see. Farmers now face months without crops or income until the next planting season,” he said, while posting a
video
of flooded farmlands in Hafizabad district.
“This is only the beginning — more intense rains are expected in the coming weeks. As the water flows further south, it will threaten more families with displacement and destruction,” Yahya added.
“This is not just another natural disaster; this is climate change.”
Endorsing the warning, Waqar Ahmad, the secretary general of Kisan Board of Pakistan, a nationwide farmers body, said that the catastrophic floods have destroyed the three main crops of rice, sugarcane and sesame (oil-rich seeds) across Punjab.
“Rice crop has particularly taken a toll as the floods have hit the major rice-producing districts,” Rizvi told
Anadolu
.
According to him, 70 per cent of the standing rice crop has been destroyed by the latest floods.
He cautioned that if neighbouring India releases another deluge of floodwaters towards Pakistan, the remaining amounts of the standing crops will be badly affected.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939740/shc-voids-kmc-move-to-rent-out-nine-parks-playgrounds,"SHC voids KMC move to rent  out nine parks, playgrounds - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has ruled that conversion of amenity parks and playgrounds for commercial use and renting them out under the public-private partnerships is illegal and without any lawful authority.
The court has also set aside the agreements inked between the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and private parties for renting out nine parks and playgrounds of the city.
A two-judge bench comprising Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Justice Mohammad Abdul Rahman on Thursday noted that the land for these public spaces, including Jheel Park, Hill Park, Umer Sharif Park, Bagh Ibne Qasim, KMC Sports Complex, Hosh Muhammad Shaheedi Park in KDA Scheme 5 and three parks / amenity plots in Block 2 of Clifton was owned by the Karachi Development Authority or the ministry of housing & works, and that the KMC has no right to administer such parks and playgrounds.
Overturning an impugned resolution of City Council regarding renting out parks and playgrounds under public-private partnerships, the SHC ruled that the KMC has no authority to regulate such parks or playgrounds under the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013 and it also lacked jurisdiction under the Karachi Development Authority Order.
City Council resolution authorising the corporation to rent out the amenity plots also overturned
The bench gave these rulings while allowing a petition filed by opposition leader in the City Council, Saifuddin Advocate, along with Jamaat-i-Islami’s chairmen of TMCs, including New Karachi, Liaquatabad, Gulberg, Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, Model Colony, Gulshan-i-Iqbal and Landhi, as well as a member of the City Council, in July challenging the City Council’s decision to allow the conversion of amenity park plots for commercial use on a rental basis allegedly in collusion with private parties.
The judgement, authored by Justice Rahman, said that a perusal of the functions indicated that KMC has been entrusted within regulating Zoological Garden, Safari Park, Aquarium, Sports Complex and beaches; and it did not have the right to regulate amenity plots which were designated as parks or playgrounds.
It also observed that in the Sindh Local Government Act, the ‘zoological garden’ referred to zoo and a reference was made to ‘Safari Park’ and such reference was not meant to parks in general but to the Karachi Safari Park.
“It would therefore seem that the jurisdiction that has been exercised by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation in the Impugned Resolution is in excess of the functions entrusted to it under the provisions of the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013,” it added.
The judgement further noted that the KDA Order, 1957 had been repealed by the Sindh Development Authorities (Laws) Ordinance, 2002 and revived by the Karachi Development Authority (Revival and Amending) Act, 2016 restoring the administration of the statutory body to areas under its administrative control.
It would, therefore, seem that after the re-enactment of that statute, the provisions of Article 52 A of the KDA Order, 1957 would once again be invoked to regulate the usage of amenity plots within the area administered by it.
The bench in its judgement said that each and every public-private partnership agreement entered into by the KMC authorising maintenance of parks was in excess of its jurisdiction, illegal and cannot be sustained. It also stated that the bench did not need to consider secondary question as to whether the agreements were entered into in violation of the provisions of the Sindh Public Procurement Act, 2009 and make any opinion on the same.
“Suffice to say that each of those “Public Private Partnership Agreements” are illegal and void as being entered into by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation in excess of the jurisdiction conferred to it under the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013,” it added.
The judgement further noted that the parks/playgrounds identified by the petitioners apart from the KMC Sports Complex, have been put to a use other than for what they were originally designated and which act cannot, therefore, be ratified under the relevant provision either.
“For the foregoing reasons we hereby declare that the impugned resolution, the ‘Public Private Partnership Agreements’ that have been entered into by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation on the basis of the impugned resolution and any amenity plots that have been ‘rented’ by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation on the basis of the impugned resolution, being in excess of the functions of that authority as indicated in Part I of Schedule II read with Section 72 of the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013 are illegal and void and that the usage of amenity plots specifically designated for use other than as a ‘playground’ e.g., as an ‘amusement park’ ‘park’ a ‘public building’ and a ‘high school’ being put to use as ‘playgrounds’ in violation of the provisions of Article 52 A of the Karachi Development Authority Order, 1957 is also illegal and are set aside.
Earlier, the petitioners had submitted that the KMC, in collusion with private entities, was unlawfully converting amenity plots for parks into commercial ventures under the guise of public-private partnership agreements.
They also contended that such commercial activities included establishing sports grounds and charging exorbitant fees for their use, parking for water tankers and conducting other profit-driven operations.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942494/monitoring-units-report-a-damning-indictment-on-cardiac-care-at-punjab-institute-of-cardiology,Monitoring unit’s report a damning indictment on cardiac care at Punjab Institute of Cardiology - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: The Chief Minister’s Special Monitoring Unit (SMU) has issued a report on the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC), Lahore, pointing out gross mismanagement, criminal negligence in the
treatment
of the heart attack and other patients and those waiting for bypass, besides exposing other grave systematic failures.
In its 22-page report, the SMU highlighted the scale of sufferings of the heart patients in the biggest public sector cardiac institute of the province.
“The SMU conducted an unannounced follow-up visit at the PIC, Lahore, and revealed systemic administrative collapse and medical negligence,” reads the report.
It has declared that the hospital is failing in its core responsibility of delivering timely, safe, and adequate cardiac care. (a copy of the report is also available with
Dawn
).
Report exposes mismanagement, mentioning names of patients
As per the report, the inspection exposed grave systemic failures: essential medicines were missing, diagnostics and interventions dangerously delayed, and critical infrastructure like CCUs and lifts left non-functional.
Staff negligence and misconduct, coupled with a broken Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) and severe lapses in hygiene and patient safety, have put lives at risk, it declared adding that immediate corrective action and strict accountability are imperative.
Raising a core issue of the long queues outside OPD pharmacy, the SMU lamented that patients were redirected to indoor pharmacy and sent back without help while the prescribed medicines were not available in both indoor and emergency pharmacies.
It stated that post-bypass medicines were withheld due to non-preparation of slips, declaring it a reckless administrative lapse.
“Model pharmacy in emergency failed to provide essential medicines and patients were not guided on alternative salts,” reads the report adding that the SMU inspection team has provided some proofs with the profiles of some patients who were denied prescribed medicines.
The SMU said the hospital staff was charging Rs2,000 for delivering urgent CDs of their surgeries instead of Rs1,500 while the patients who were unable to pay urgent fee were forced to wait for three months or so, declaring it a clear case of exploitation.
The pharmacy staff’s behaviour was reported as rude, dismissive, and hostile with the cardiac patients and their attendants.
There were no temperature/humidity meters in the OPD pharmacy and the installation of one AC there was posing potential risks of damage to medicines.
The SMU also declared the ‘medicine home delivery service’ a failed scheme saying the cardiac patients were forced to visit the PIC to collect the same.
“A patient Muhammad Rafique, reported that he did not receive his medicines at home for the last 2-3 months. He is forced to personally visit PIC every month to collect medicines”, reads the report.
The report alleges that the pharmacists were observed distributing medicines partially instead of the full prescribed quantity.
It highlighted the cases of six such patients who were provided incomplete medicines by the pharmacists.
“During SMU’s visit, pharmacist Ms. Mahnoor (In-charge OPD Pharmacy) was absent from duty while the other pharmacy staff had no information about available stock and directed the SMU to the AMS. This is a clear dereliction of duty by the In-charge,” reads the report.
While shedding light on the mismanagement in diagnostic services and extreme delays, the SMU lamented that prolonged echocardiography waiting time has extended to a month period and declared this practice dangerous for critical cardiac patients. Similarly, it said, the ultrasound waiting time [3/4 days] was being repeatedly rescheduled besides highlighting the mismanagement in the X-Ray, CT Scan, OPD and ECHO departments.
Medical representatives were found roaming in corridors near ECHO desk in blatant violation of the laid down SoPs while there was only one bed available in ECG room which was causing delays in urgent admissions from emergency.
The SMU pointed out that only one doctor was on duty in the emergency room to examine new arrivals – risking crucial minutes of life-saving care.
The air conditioning was non-functional across wards, CCUs, waiting areas, CT Scan and X-Ray rooms.
Out of the two lifts installed in the Emergency Block, one was functional, creating delays in shifting critical patients.
There was only one wheelchair without a pedal available, leaving the cardiac patients in grave distress while the bed sheets in wards were in the worst condition.
A patient was forced to bring his personal pulse oximeter as no cardiac monitor was available on the third floor of the hospital.
The SMU report pointed out another negligence stating no oxygen flow meters were attached to the beds.
About the common complaints, it said, a heart patient (Amir) was left unattended for two hours or so as no doctor was available in the emergency ward while the angiography of a heart attack patient (Ijaz) brought from Gujranwala was delayed over 24 hours.
The bypass of a patient (Fayyaz Ali) was not performed 22 days after his admission.
A heart patient (Sohail Muneer) was brought to the PIC following the serious complaints of leakage of his valve due to negligence at multiple hospitals. His dental clearance test was lost by the PIC sweeper and the doctors discharged the patient without surgery.
“The medical form of a patient, Rehana (Bed 17, 3rd floor), had contradictory entries “Yes” and “No”(ticked for diabetes) which was a high-risk blunder before operation,” reads the SMU report.
The doctors were found using mobile phones inside offices during duty while patients were waiting.
Similarly, the nursing staff members in emergency ICU/HDU were also found busy on phones, ignoring critical patients.
The SMU report also highlighted a number of other such serious complaints, stressing upon the authorities concerned to take notice for the sake of the cardiac patients at the PIC Lahore.

Dawn.com
on Thursday.
Local traders in GB have been
staging
a protest sit-in, blocking the port since July. The protest was launched against the government’s taxation policies and suspension of customs clearance at the port.
Yesterday, the government agreed to tax exemptions on imports coming through the port — provided that the goods were for local consumption and meet strict eligibility conditions. The total annual value of tax exemptions was capped at Rs4 billion.
This was announced after talks between the federal government, GB government and local business leaders in Islamabad.
But, Hussain said traders were not satisfied with this agreement.
“After the agreement and its announcement in Islamabad, it was suggested to us to end the protest. But we don’t agree with this [suggestion] and have decided to continue the sit-in and keep the trade suspended,” he said.
Hussain said traders would now have a sitting with its representative body that held talks with the government. If its members were able to give a satisfactory justification regarding yesterday’s agreement, traders would deliberate on whether to continue the protest, he added.
“Setting a limit on imports and placing a cap of Rs4bn goes against our demands,” he asserted, adding that traders’ demands were based on GB’s “legal status” in the country and the “exemption it was provided under the Constitution”.
But the decision made in Islamabad is contrary to this, and “we are of the view that by setting a limit on imports, decision-makers have [failed to resolve] the fundamental dispute”, he said.
Hussain also pointed out that a statutory regulatory order (SRO) had not been issued so far and only an agreement was finalised. “We are carefully reviewing the provisions of this agreement,” he added.
Reiterating the traders were not satisfied with the agreement, he said they could go for a “Plan C”.
He added that they would also consult the stakeholders and discuss the shortcomings of the agreement, after which they would consider ending the protest.
The trade leader also raised the questioned that why “dozens of containers that were stuck for several months” were not being given clearance through an SRO and other procedures were being opted for, for this purpose.",2025-09-25,Imtiaz Ali Taj,628,0.000107
https://www.dawn.com/news/1944606/woman-kidnaps-newborn-from-lahores-mayo-hospital,Woman kidnaps newborn from Lahore’s Mayo Hospital - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: An unidentified woman allegedly kidnapped a newborn girl from the paeds ward of the Mayo Hospital on Thursday.
The baby was shifted to one of the major public healthcare facilities of Punjab from the Lady Aitchison Hospital for some tests recommended by the doctors.
The police rushed to the hospital on being informed of the incident by its administration and launched investigations.
Earlier, a
similar incident
was reported in the Lahore General Hospital, where a woman kidnapped a newborn. The police had, however, arrested the woman and recovered the baby within 48 hours of the incident.
About the fresh incident, a police official says that the wife of a Muridke resident, Qasim, delivered the baby two days ago in the Lady Aitchison Hospital.
On Thursday, he said, Qasim got his newborn baby admitted to the paediatric ward of the Mayo Hospital, where she was to undergo some tests.
Meanwhile, as per the hospital sources, a woman allegedly dodged the security staff, entered the ward and took away the newborn.
The official says it is a matter of serious concern that the hospital administration took no special measures to avoid such incidents.
“We examined the security cameras that captured the suspect (woman),” the police official says, adding that police teams have been deputed to trace the kidnapper woman with the help of more private and Punjab Safe Cities Authority cameras.
The Mayo Hospital CEO told the media that a committee has been constituted to identify the lapses and the negligence of the staff concerned.
A senior doctor, Prof Imran Hassan, heads the committee, he said, adding that the police have also been asked to investigate the kidnapping incident.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1938834,President signs controversial Anti-Terrorism Bill into law - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday signed into law the
controversial
Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which the government
claims
is aimed at strengthening counterterrorism efforts while ensuring legal oversight and safeguards.
Under the legislation, any person suspected of engaging in activities that threaten national security or public safety can be detained. Those involved in target killings, kidnappings for ransom or extortion may be held for up to three months.
The bill says it applies to any person “against whom sufficient grounds exist of his having been so concerned, for the purpose of inquiry”.
It also specifies that detention under Section 11EEEE, including periods beyond three months, will be subject to Article 10 of the Constitution, which provides safeguards relating to arrest and detention.
Consensus reached on amendments to National Commission for Minorities Rights Bill
“If a detention order is issued by the army or civil forces, the investigation will be conducted by a joint investigation team,” the bill states. “The inquiry will be conducted by no police officer below the rank of superintendent of police, intelligence agencies, civil armed forces, armed forces, and other law-enforcing agencies.”
A statement of objects and reasons, presented in the houses during the passage of the bill, said that the current security situation in the country required a “robust response that goes beyond the existing legal framework”.
PTI has opposed the bill, stressing that it could be used against it.
The amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997, were passed by both the National Assembly and the Senate this month amid opposition uproar.
The Presidency said in a statement that the law included judicial oversight and safeguards to provide recourse against the misuse and abuse of power, unlike past arbitrary practices.
“The amendment aims to improve counterterrorism efforts while ensuring legal oversight and safeguards,” it said. “This is an important step in addressing Pakistan’s ongoing security challenges.”
It added, “The government or, where the provisions of Section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case may be, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventative detention of any person.” This amendment was made to Sub-Section 1 of Section 11EEEE of the ATA.
“The erstwhile amendment of Section 11EEEE of the Act ibid, are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, Armed Forces and Civil Armed Forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security,” it added.
Minorities Rights bill
The Presidency also announced on Sunday that a consensus had been reached on
amendments
to the National Commission for Minorities Rights Bill, 2025.
It added that the revised version had been finalised at a recent meeting at the Presidency and forwarded to parliament for reconsideration in a joint session.
The amendments were prepared following a message from the President under Article 75(1) of the Constitution.

In recent years, Russia and Pakistan have engaged in strengthening bilateral ties with each other. In July, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk said Islamabad and Moscow were “natural allies”. On June 3, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in a meeting with PM’s aide Syed Tariq Fatemi,
reaffirmed
Russia’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan, following a
memorandum of understanding
(MoU) signed last September on multi-sector collaboration.
The meeting between the two leaders took place in Beijing today amid their visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of States (CHS) summit a day ago.
Addressing the Russian president, PM Shehbaz said: “Relations between the two countries have improved in recent years due to your personal commitment and interest.”
He expressed the resolve that Pakistan was also keen to strengthen the bilateral relations further, adding that they were moving in the right direction.
The premier added that after their meeting in Astana last year, both countries witnessed a flurry of delegation visits at the higher level, adding they also signed protocols to promote the agriculture, iron, steel, energy and transport sectors.
The prime minister also underlined the significance of the trade corridor connecting Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, noting that this initiative would boost regional connectivity and prosperity.
Expressing his satisfaction, he said both sides were keenly committed to building their relations.
The prime minister also expressed gratitude to the Russian president for supporting Pakistan, which was viewed as “a balancing act in the region”.
He said Pakistan respected Russia’s ties with India and wanted to establish very strong relations of its own, which would be “supplementary and complementary”.
PM Shehbaz expressed that these beneficial ties would add to the progress and prosperity of the region and assured President Putin of working closely in this context, as he had found him to be a “dynamic leader”.
Responding to Putin’s invitation to attend the SCO Heads of Government Summit in November, the premier replied that he was looking forward to it.
Meanwhile, President Putin said, “Pakistan has always been a traditional partner and remains as such in Asia, and we cherish these ties,” adding that both sides had agreed to intensify their bilateral relations.
The president noted that their bilateral trade needed to be enhanced and stressed taking steps to address the issue.
He also expressed his grief and extended his condolences to the people and the government of Pakistan on the losses suffered from catastrophes and natural disasters, including the recent flooding.
President Putin expressed optimism that Pakistan would overcome such challenges under the current leadership.
He also opined that the two countries kept cooperating at the inter-parliamentary levels, adding, “Pakistan is a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and both countries are keeping contacts within the framework of the United Nations, which is an important platform.”
Prior to their meeting, the prime minister appreciated Putin’s leadership for making sincere efforts to promote bilateral relations with Pakistan.
He observed that after their meeting in Astana during last year’s SCO-CHS summit, they had agreed to work closely to bolster the bilateral cooperation.
PM Shehbaz expressed confidence that together, both countries would make further efforts to promote bilateral ties and cooperation, particularly in commerce and trade.
He added that Pakistan-Russia bilateral trade witnessed a spike as Islamabad imported oil from Moscow last year that led to an increase in the trade volume.
PM, Tajik president express satisfaction with ongoing bilateral cooperation
Separately, PM Shehbaz met Tajikistan’s president and both leaders expressed their satisfaction with the ongoing cooperation between their countries in all areas of mutual interest.
The two leaders agreed to enhance collaboration in diverse fields, including trade and investment, connectivity, energy, regional security, culture, and people-to-people exchanges.
Both also reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations rooted in shared cultural, historical, and religious ties.

“There are areas where a lot can be done, there are areas where a lot of engagement can be done,” he said, adding that “Pakistan views its relationship with the US as very important.”
“We don’t think that these relationships have anything to do — or there is either-or with other countries.” At this point, the interviewer interjected him to mention China, with the DG ISPR continuing — following a cut in the video — that “we, at the same time, have very constructive and strategic relationships with China and other countries.”
He said that there is a lot of “scope” for collaboration between the US and Pakistan on the matter of counterterrorism.
On that note, he expressed satisfaction over the United States’ recent
declaration
of the Majeed brigade as a terrorist outfit.
Pakistan
has proscribed
the Majeed Brigade — the terrorist outfit Balochistan Liberation Army’s suicide squad — as a terrorist entity since July 18, 2024.
On the question of Pakistan’s
concerns
over weapons systems left behind by the US in the wake of its
withdrawal
from Afghanistan, DG ISPR cited the retrieval of US-made weapons from terrorists involved in the Mianwali airbase
attack
on 4 November 2023 as evidence.
He said that “we share all this data with the Americans,” adding that “the amount of weapons left behind by the US is huge.”
Quoting a
report
prepared by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), Lt-Gen Chaudhry said that, “after withdrawal of the United States and NATO forces, more than $7.2 billion worth of US equipment has been left.”
On the issue of strained relations with India, DG ISPR referred to the May escalation, noting that “On May 10, actually the fire ceased — it’s the cease of fire that happened, [but] the conflict endures.”
“Whether it is the Kashmir issue, whether it is state-sponsored terrorism of India, whether it is the rising extremism of Hindutva mentality, rationality that has gripped India —” Lt-Gen Chaudhry said.
Stating Pakistan’s position on the matter, he said, “Pakistan believes that the issues need [a] resolution,” calling for international actors to intervene.
“Especially players like the USA, they must intervene,” he said.
He went on to say: “We have no doubt in our minds in Pakistan that each and every incident of terrorism that happens in Pakistan — behind that is Indian support and its abetment.”
Noting Pakistan’s efforts in curbing terrorism and the frequency of terrorist attacks in the country, DG ISPR highlighted that, “just by the threat that is coming to Pakistan, any sane mind can understand this can not go on without external support.”
DG ISPR alleged that, “the base of operation that the Indians use is Afghanistan, the whole of terrorism that is being done is executed by the Indians over there.”
“Indians have a playbook of using terror as a tool of state,” he said, claiming that their “main tools” at the moment are terrorist outfits Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and BLA.
On the question of insurgency in the country, DG ISPR denied that such a thing existed, stating, “There is no insurgency in Pakistan; the correct term is terrorist,” he said.
Asked if the grievances of the people in Balochistan are properly addressed, he claimed that out of Balochistan’s total population, only a fraction actually lived in Balochistan, saying that “before talking about the issue, it is important to see how many Baloch are we talking about.”
Over the issue of missing persons in Balochistan, he claimed that “half of these missing persons are part of BLA.”
He said that several terrorists killed in Balochistan were included in the list of missing persons as well, claiming that there were more missing persons in Sindh and Punjab than in Balochistan.",2025-09-19,Dawn.com,1339,0.00016
https://www.dawn.com/news/1944674/quest-for-economic-sovereignty,Quest for economic sovereignty - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"IN 1765, undivided India lost its financial sovereignty when Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II granted the East India Company the right to collect taxes (diwani) in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.
This enabled systematic extraction of wealth and control over India’s economy and redirected resources to Britain. This erosion of financial sovereignty undermined national security and ultimately state sovereignty.
After independence, Pakistan regained sovereignty when the Quaid inaugurated the State Bank of Pakistan on July 1, 1948, and issued its own currency. Until then, the Reserve Bank of India controlled Pakistan’s currency and banking system. As the Quaid noted, “The opening of the State Bank of Pakistan symbolises the sovereignty of our state in the financial sphere.”
That sovereignty has gradually eroded through unchecked reliance on external aid. At the macro level, Pakistan remains locked in
IMF programmes.
Budgets are passed by parliament but pre-approved by the IMF. Monetary policy is nominally independent but shaped by Fund advice. The energy sector is trapped by IMF diktats to raise tariffs and fuel taxes. Recently, the IMF has even intruded into governance and judicial realms, beyond its mandate and expertise. The 2021 SBP Act amendments — passed reluctantly by the parliament under IMF conditionality despite strong reservations by all parties — symbolised a blow to sovereignty.
Since 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has financed over 300 programmes and the World Bank (WB) more than 150, many co-financed by bilateral donors. They are involved across virtually all socioeconomic sectors: tax, energy, trade, agriculture, SMEs, finance, urban management, water, health, education, and justice. Many projects overlap as donors compete. Donors claim to promote self-reliance, yet the sheer number and scale of projects undertaken for decades contradict that very claim.
Today, Pakistan appears to have become a colony of donors. Even junior staff of the IMF and donor agencies often act like viceroys and vicereines, negotiating directly with ministers and top civil servants dictating advice.
Between 2000 and 2022, Pakistan received about $50 billion in official development assistance (ODA). Yet it still ranks near the bottom of global human, social and economic indicators.
International aid erodes sovereignty because donors pursue their own agendas.
Despite the proliferation of multibillion-dollar donor projects over decades, it is difficult to find tangible positive outcomes. Growth has stalled, unemployment is rising, and poverty is deepening. Twenty-six million children remain out of school, 40 per cent of under-fives are stunted, corruption has surged, and government effectiveness has deteriorated.
Waste and abuse of borrowed resources is evident from the failure of donor-driven projects to improve the tax-to-GDP ratio, exports and competitiveness, SME financing, or even Karachi’s liveability conditions. Ironically, the very sectors that have received sustained donor support remain most inefficient, resulting in policy lethargy, institutional decay, and misuse of resources.
The World Bank, ADB and others claim to be Pakistan’s ‘development partners’ but accept no responsibility for worsening conditions. Our officials outsource policy formulation and abdicate decision-making to foreign technocrats who have no stake in Pakistan’s future. Meanwhile, foreign aid has burdened the country with large, unsusta­inable debt, and repayments consume enormous resources, leaving behind little for investment in people.
International aid erodes sovereignty because donors pursue their own agendas. Bilateral donors use aid as ‘soft power’ to secure votes in international organisations, support allies, access markets for exports, deter asylum seekers, or fight terrorism. As US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated this year,
changes
to USAID are “not about ending foreign aid” but about structuring it to further US national interests. In 2018, UK prime minister Theresa May declared that post-Brexit Britain’s aid would be used to advance British trade and political interests.
If poverty alleviation or economic development were the true objectives, most aid would flow to the poorest nations — South Sudan, Burundi, Congo, Mozambique, etc. Instead, donor countries channel resources to strategic allies. Ukraine, for example, received $40bn in ODA in 2023 and $29.5bn in 2022, making it the largest aid recipient ever. In 2023, the US’s top five aid recipients were Ukraine, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and Ethiopia.
Pakistan now receives little in bilateral ODA — just $116 million from USAID in 2024 and £41.5m from the UK. These sums are negligible compared to Pakistan’s $410bn economy, but grant donors disproportionate influence.
While USAID has shut down, the UK’s FCDO remains deeply entrenched. Through certain entities, it encroaches upon the SBP’s role in the financial sector. Also, in another instance, Karandaaz has penetrated the FBR to ‘modernise its tax system’, though its expertise in tax administration is open to question. Using Gates Foundation funds, it hired McKinsey to digitise FBR operations, with some fearing that such moves can give access to sensitive information. Many would see this as a breach of sovereignty.
Tax collection is a fundamental function of a sovereign state. Imagine, Pakistan’s tax authority, mobilising Rs12 trillion in taxes, needing a few million dollars from a foundation to modernise itself.
India, once dependent on foreign aid, has since transitioned from a recipient to net donor. After the 2004 tsunami, prime minister Manmohan Singh turned down humanitarian aid, saying India could cope on its own. Since then, India has disciplined aid flows, ending most bilateral programmes, channelling money through multilaterals, and restricting NGO foreign funding.
Pakistan must also discipline international aid by restricting it to projects that enhance productivity and directly contribute to growth, while keeping debt within sustainable limits. The approach of accepting whatever comes in, on whatever terms, must end.
The Economic Affairs Division must set clear priorities for external assistance, identify critical sectors and agencies for development cooperation, and communicate them to donors. Multilateral concessional financing should support demand-driven projects with high development impact. Bilateral donor programmes should be diminished sharply with their offices closed in Pakistan. This would immediately signal to the government to assume full responsibility for development and the welfare of its citizens.
The quest for economic sovereignty is not about rejecting aid entirely. It is about regaining control over economic policy choices and ensuring external assistance serves Pakistan’s core development priorities, rather than foreign agendas. It is not just about pride — it is vital for national security and prosperity.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943783/fao-warns-of-above-normal-rainfall-along-the-border-with-india,FAO warns of above-normal rainfall along the border with India - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, citing sub-seasonal models, has forecast above-normal rai­nfall along the Indo-Pakistan border in late September, with a possible recurrence during the last week of October, despite the withdrawal of the monsoon.
According to the FAO report on seasonal precipitation in the desert locust summer and winter breeding areas from October 2025 to March 2026, conditions are projected to become drier than normal in November and December, with normal rainfall expected in January.
The report says spring bre­e­ding areas along the southea­s­tern coasts of Iran and southwestern Pakistan are forecast to receive above-normal to nor­­mal rainfall in February and March.
FAO noted that very small-scale summer breeding may continue along the Indo-Pakistan border in October but is expected to end in Nove­mber. These rainfall patterns will also support locust breeding in the northern Sahel and Sudan through September and early October. Breeding is expected to decrease in November but may intensify again from December to March.
The World Climate Service’s latest seasonal precipitation predictions cover the spring, summer and winter breeding areas of the desert locust.
The report says above-normal rainfall is expected in late September across the northern Sahel, the southern Arabian Peninsula, and the Indo-Pakistan border, and may persist into early October in West Africa and the Indo-Pakistan border.
A drying trend is anticipated across most regions in October and November due to a negative Indian Ocean Dipole.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945021/limited-govt-jobs-frustrate-young-medics-in-kp,Limited govt jobs frustrate young medics in KP - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"PESHAWAR: Medical and dental colleges in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province are producing far more graduates than the government vacancies, spreading frustration among young doctors.
The province had 20 medical and 11 dental colleges in the public and private sectors, producing around 2,900 graduates every year, according to the Khyber Medical University, the only admitting university for those institutions.
The KMU conducts the Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT) on behalf of the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council every year.
The MBBS seats in the private sector’s 10 medical and five dental colleges total 1,454, while the tally of students from 10 medical and six dental colleges in the private sector goes to 1,425, according to officials of the health department.
They told
Dawn
that those securing top positions on the “merit list” after MDCAT went to public colleges where the annual fee was “somewhat affordable.” The officials said many of those having money got admission in private colleges after failing to secure seats in public medical colleges and pay around Rs2 million tuition and other fees a year.
They insisted that a private student spent around Rs10 million as the admission fee in private medical and dental colleges but the number of jobs in government and private sectors was “shrinking.”
The data obtained from the health department’s Health Sector Reforms Unit showed that the province had over 2,500 health facilities, including 2,438 primary care centres and 128 category A, B, C and D hospitals, including district headquarters hospitals, with 90, 000 staff members, including 8,052 medical officers, 561 management cadre doctors and 662 dental surgeons.
The doctors complained about the unplanned medical colleges, which, they said, are producing around 2,900 graduates every year but there were only a dozen of posts advertised by the department, so the number of jobless medics was increasing.
They also said more and more medical and dental graduates were coming in from China and Central Asian countries every year, aggravating the job crisis.
The doctors claimed that last June, 81pc candidates couldn’t pass the written test conducted by the Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency for the vacant slots of medical officers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
They said the Etea held tests of 8,974 students but only 1,766 of them remained successful.
The doctors said the unsuccessful candidates had to opt for the private sector jobs.
A doctor said that he spent more than Rs15 million to become a doctor from a private medical college but was getting Rs40,000 salary in a private hospital after graduation and that he wasn’t allowed to take leave during the two-month probation period.
He insisted that some graduates were being paid Rs50,000 to Rs75,000 a month.
Experts demanded that the government and regulatory bodies streamline medical education.
They said there was a plan that the students with second division in the FSc exam would be allowed to sit MDCAT.
“This option is being considered as many private medical colleges have failed to fill their student quota last year, leaving many seats unfilled,” a senior educationist told Dawn.
He said allowing students with low scores in FSc exam would not only affect the standards of medical and dental graduates but add to the “unemployment pool.”
The experts said the hospitals didn’t have the capacity to provide standardised training facilities to the graduates in hospitals during house jobs, so the government shouldn’t allow an increase in medical college seats and establishment of more colleges.
They called for government measures to ensure improvement of teaching standards in medical and dental schools.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944466/lighting-the-way,Lighting the way - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE World Bank has issued a stark warning to Pakistan in a
report
released on Tuesday.
The country’s growth model has run its course, and over the past five years, the number of people living below the poverty line has begun to swell after two decades of shrinkage.
Not only that. Nearly 40 per cent of children are stunted, and this percentage has not changed much over a long period of time. One quarter of children of primary school age remain out of school. Of the ones that do go to school, 75pc of those who finish primary schooling cannot read, or follow a simple story.
One after another, the dismal state of the population as seen in the social indicators testifies to the fact that the economy is not delivering, whether or not it grows. The middle of the decade of the 2010s saw a high-growth spurt, yet between the years 2011 and 2021, “real wage growth in sectors employing the poor remained minimal at just 2-3pc” the report notes, “making the poor ill-equipped to convert economic growth into income-generating opportunities”.
The report is a strong reminder that Pakistan’s economic urgency is actually not about growth. It is about reform. This economy cannot lift people out of poverty even when it grows. It cannot reduce income disparities between urban and rural, or between geographical regions. It cannot create enough jobs for the youth, or furnish income-generating opportunities for women at a rate sufficiently fast to make any meaningful impact in the lives of the multitude.
One reason for this, the report points out, is that 95pc of all job growth for the poor in the early years of the 2000s, when poverty levels fell sharply, was due to opportunities in the informal sector, and the movement of labour from agriculture to low-quality jobs in services and construction. That drop in poverty was not brought about due to expanding opportunities in the formal sector.
The World Bank report is a strong reminder that Pakistan’s economic urgency is actually not about growth.
Meanwhile, the state as presently constituted cannot educate its children, reduce the incidence of stunting among them, build resilience to shocks (such as
floods
) at the local level — and on and on and on.
The report proposes a number of pathways forward. These include strengthened public service delivery, devolution to local governments and their empowerment via a fiscal model that provides them with the resources they need to discharge their responsibilities.
Other ways forward include what they call “building resilience” via social safety nets and improved targeting through the National Socio-Economic Registry, and finally developing better data systems “through a robust statistical infrastructure that produces accessible, high-frequency, and granular data” to drive evidence-based research, which can serve both as a feedback loop and an input in policy design.
Of all these, the last deserves particular mention. I have long argued for more legally mandated data release templates across government departments. This has many benefits that appear slowly, but reliably, and help focus attention on metrics against which to measure progress.
For now, the single most robust data dissemination template that operates in the country is the one that focuses on the health of the external sector. We get high-quality data on the balance of payments and trade, and multiple data points against which to measure the foreign exchange reserves, as well as the forward positions taken by the State Bank. The debt statistics are more thorough than any other, and a clear picture of Pakistan’s debt profile can be easily built very quickly.
Try finding out a few basic facts about education or health, however, and you’ll notice how woefully inadequate our data is. Try looking for more regular data on the power sector, and you will have to wade through unspeakably complex Nepra documents to piece the picture together yourself. Forget about employment. That data gets released once a year in a good year.
Maybe the World Bank can play a proactive role here in helping develop a data release template for the power sector, for starters. Maybe it would be a good idea for data on the accumulation of circular debt to be released officially, as per pre-defined protocols, on a fortnightly basis.
Maybe there should be a simple data page on the Nepra website, where we can see fuel consumption data broken down by power plant every month. Maybe units sent out can be shown on a map by coverage area, and next to it we can see recoveries made in the same area during the same period.
There is a lot of room for expansion here. The provincial governments should also be mandated to release key data relating to health and education on a regular basis. The template for this release should be standardised to enable comparisons across provinces, and ideally with other countries as well.
This sort of data release requirement helps bring some discipline in government departments. It enables outsiders to track performance. It helps identify those areas where policy needs to be strengthened. And it reduces the scope for discretionary decision-making. In short, an expansive and standardised data collection and disclosure requirement on government departments can help bring about the kinds of reforms the World Bank is saying Pakistan needs to undertake.
One big reason why change is so hard to bring about in this country is precisely because large swathes of it operate in the dark, in the sense that there is no transparency. Without transparency, it is hard to build accountability. And without accountability, there is no incentive to change, because continuing with business as usual is easier and risk-free.
Maybe a little daylight in the darker recesses of the state will help jolt a few civil servants out of their complacency. Maybe some evidence-based metrics will help light the way, away from the culture of idle complaining that has taken root among the elites.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940041,17 booked for attempting to breach dyke in Chishtian - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"BAHWALNAGAR: As many as 17 people were booked by the Shehar Farid police in Chishtian on Friday for attempting to break a temporary protective dyke in the Kamiraan village which is surrounded by floodwater.
According to the FIR, seven residents of Kamiraan village, along with 10 unknown persons, were breaking the temporary protective dyke around the village with heavy machinery and tractors at 7pm on September 4.
When the locals intervened, they beat them up, fired in the air and threatened to kill them. However, the men fled when a large police contingent arrived at the scene after being informed by the local residents.
It is pertinent to mention here that many temporary protective dykes built by locals at various places in the 160 kilometer-long Sutlej belt in Bahawalnagar have broken. Due to this, thousands of acres of land have been submerged and dozens of villages of Minchinabad, Bahawalnagar and Chishtian have been affected by the river and they have been cut-off from the cities.
On Thursday night, another large protective dyke near the bridge connecting Bahawalnagar and Sahiwal at Bhukan Pattan on Arifwala Road broke, not only flooding several settlements, but also raising concerns that Bahawalnagar will be cut off from other cities.
Youth drowns in floodwater
However, the locals were making every effort to repair the dyke. On the other hand, the district administration issued an alert to the relevant departments expressing fears of extremely high levels of flooding in the Sutlej and also appealed to the public to take precautionary measures.
Meanwhile, a teenager died by drowning in the floodwater in Chishtian on Friday.
Rescue officials said that deceased Shahzad (16) worked at the house of a landlord in the Sial settlement of Jhaiduan mouza. They said that the settlement was surrounded by floodwater on all sides, but most of the residents had not moved to safer places.
According to the officials, Shahzad slipped and drowned in the deep floodwater after leaving the house. He was later pulled out by the locals.
Rescue 1122 shifted the body to Chishtian THQ for legal formalities.

out-of-school children
and a lack of current data to tackle a serious student dropout rate, Provincial Education Minister Raheela Hameed Khan Durrani said.
The minister speaking at a policy roundtable, said strengthening the capability of policymakers through deep analysis is key to solving the crisis. She said her ministry is committed to reducing the dropout rate, especially for young girls, by using effective new tools.
The roundtable was convened by the Data and Research in Education-Research Consortium (DARE-RC) to synergise its research with Balochistan’s education policies.
“I am grateful to DARE-RC for approaching us and we hope that DARE-RC’s work will help us to achieve this,” Ms Durrani said.
The event brought together representatives from government, academia, and development partners to discuss emerging evidence and integrate research insights into provincial priorities.
Provincial education minister highlights lack of data to tackle the issue
The consortium is a partnership between Oxford Policy Management (OPM), Aga Khan University Institute for Educational Development (AKU-IED), and Sightsavers, with funding from the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).
Throughout the discussions, policymakers and resea­rchers emphasised the critical need to build a practice of data utilisation within the
education sector
to improve access and quality of learning for all children.
Salim Salamah, an education policy adviser at the British High Commission, said a bridge is needed between research and reform.
“There is a lot of important and interesting research taking place by brilliant Pakistani academics and there are concerned policymakers working to advance critical reforms in the education system especially in the case of out-of-school children,” Mr Salamah said.
Balochistan School Education Department Secretary Asfandyar Khan Kakar said such dialogues are essential to connect government work with academic insights.
“Research isn’t generally encouraged in the public sector and this gap between academia and government needs to be bridged with the help of such dialogues,” Mr Kakar said. “I encourage the promotion of research in our work and the involvement of Balochistan’s local resources in driving change.”
The consortium’s program director, Saima Anwer, said the organisation’s mission is to make academic work more relevant to officials on the ground.
“The spirit of DARE-RC is how to bridge the gap between research and policymaking so that the research being carried out in universities is relevant to the realms of the government,” Ms Anwer said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944296/trumps-gaza-plan-diplomacy-dilemmas-and-pakistans-role,"Trump’s Gaza plan: Diplomacy, dilemmas, and Pakistan’s role - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","After a
fiery address
at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, where he opposed the growing wave of global recognition for a Palestinian state, US President Donald Trump convened a high-level meeting with leaders of Muslim-majority
countries
to present Washington’s plan for ending the war in Gaza.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar represented Pakistan at the gathering, alongside leaders from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Türkiye, and Indonesia.
The meeting, held on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA session, brought together regional heavyweights in an unprecedented show of diplomatic coordination. Ahead of formal consultations, Trump told his guests:
“We have to get the hostages back … This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world … so it’s an honour to be with you.”
Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes in Gaza have
killed
more than 65,000 people in response to the
Hamas attack
and the taking of
hostages
.
Trump also emphasised the urgency of ending the conflict: “We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started.”
Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani responded to Trump’s comments by thanking him for hosting the meeting.
“We count on your leadership as well to end this war and to help the people of Gaza,” he said.
Pakistan’s consistent advocacy
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while talking to Pakistani journalists, welcomed Trump’s commitment, describing it as evidence that the US leader was “indeed a man of peace”.
He recalled Washington’s role in preventing a potentially devastating
conflict
between India and Pakistan back in May, adding: “For that we thank him from the depths of our hearts.”
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, in an earlier UN engagement, highlighted the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza,
describing
it as a “graveyard for humanity” and urging the international community to move beyond statements to tangible action.
Pakistan’s participation reflects a careful balancing act: maintaining constructive engagement with Washington while insisting on Palestinian sovereignty, adherence to international law, and a two-state solution. In doing so, Islamabad aligns with Arab states that reject unilateral solutions undermining Palestinian self-determination.
Anatomy of Trump’s proposal
According to reports from Israel’s
Channel 12
and US-based
Axios
, President Trump’s plan envisions:
An immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages, both alive and
deceased
Phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza
Governance excluding Hamas but incorporating the Palestinian
Authority
Deployment of Arab and Muslim peacekeepers to secure Gaza and
facilitate Israel’s withdrawal
Internationally supported reconstruction and transition programmes
funded by regional contributors
These details were reportedly shared with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though Israel did not draft the plan.
In interviews with various US channels, Secretary of State Marco Rubio framed the proposal in long-term terms.
“The only way to a permanent solution to the challenge between Palestinians and Israelis is a negotiated settlement,” he said.
“One in which the Palestinians are going to have a territory and they’re going to govern it, but it cannot be one that’s going to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.”
Describing the New York meeting as “one last shot” in an interview with
CBS News
, Rubio emphasised its goal: ending the Gaza conflict, securing all remaining hostages, and establishing a humanitarian relief framework.
Multiple challenges
Trump’s plan attempts to address three simultaneous crises: Israel’s security concerns, Palestinian humanitarian needs, and the geopolitical desire of the US to position itself as the ultimate mediator.
However, the plan faces multiple challenges, including legitimacy, as excluding Hamas would risk alienating a significant portion of the Palestinian population.
Secondly, the plan could have regional consensus. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that proposals affecting Gaza’s population without their consent constituted “a very different threat to world peace.”
Thirdly, the on-the-ground realities pose extraordinary challenges. With more than 65,000 Palestinians reported killed since October 7 — most of them civilians — achieving a swift diplomatic settlement will be exceedingly difficult.
Trump’s outreach contrasts with his UNGA speech, where he criticised European recognitions of Palestine as rewarding Hamas for “horrible atrocities” and pressed instead for a “ceasefire-for-prisoners” deal.
Meanwhile, 154 countries have recognised Palestine, underscoring the limits of Washington’s unilateral influence.
Humanitarian and political implications
Beyond ceasefires, Trump’s plan seeks to reshape Gaza’s political landscape — empowering the Palestinian Authority while relying on regional peacekeepers. While this could stabilise governance temporarily, it risks inflaming political tensions if not paired with inclusive, locally sanctioned negotiations.
Pakistan’s emphasis on legality, human rights, and the two-state solution ensures that its stance remains morally credible and aligned with international law. This approach also strengthens Islamabad’s credibility among Muslim-majority nations increasingly wary of unilateral Western initiatives.
US mediation shows assertiveness but future remains uncertain
Trump’s Gaza plan embodies both ambition and risk. Diplomatically, it signals an assertive US effort to mediate a complex conflict, yet long-term prospects remain uncertain. Pakistan’s careful balancing — engaging with Washington, reaffirming Palestinian rights, and urging immediate humanitarian relief —  illustrates the nuanced role smaller, principled actors can play in global crises.
As Rubio framed it, the New York meeting was “one last shot” at ending the conflict, securing hostages, and establishing humanitarian relief.
For Pakistan, the challenge lies in ensuring that this diplomatic opportunity upholds justice, protects human life, and preserves the possibility of a sovereign, viable Palestine.",2025-09-24,Anwar Iqbal,1550,0.000176

• Insists court will first hear and decide maintainability of petitions
• Petitioners and their lawyers walk out of courtroom, stage protest
KARACHI: Heated sce­nes were witnessed at the Sindh High Court on Thursday as a two-judge bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Islamabad High Court Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on seven petitions,
challenging
the cancellation of his law degree.
The two-judge constitutional bench (CB) comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, however, set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions before it.
Justice Jahangiri, accompanied by IHC Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, pleaded for a right of hearing, saying he was the aggrieved party and Karachi University (KU) had not issued him a notice before canceling his degree.
Lawyers for the petitioners, however, objected to the jurisdiction of the bench and urged the court to decide their objections first.
The proceedings drew a large number of lawyers inside and outside the courtroom, with many chanting slogans, clapping and later staging a protest outside the SHC against one of the judges.
The petitioners and their lawyers also walked out of the courtroom in protest over their objections not being addressed and the court’s refusal to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea.
Some lawyers later claimed that the bench had dismissed the petitions for non-prosecution, though the written order is expected to be issued today (Friday).
The petitions had been filed last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the KU syndicate, challenging decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that
canceled
Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU decisions, restraining the university from taking coercive measures.
The court had observed that every citizen’s right to fair trial was protected but that no hearing had been provided to Justice Jahangiri before the cancellation of the degree, which appeared obj­ec­­tionable, illegal and without authority.
The petitions were fixed for Thursday’s hearing after the Sindh Higher Education Commission (SHEC) filed an urgent application seeking vacation of the interim stay order.
Justice Jahangiri also appeared in person, filing an application to intervene in the proceedings. However, Justice Agha remarked that the court would first examine the issue of maintainability.
Senior lawyer Faisal Siddiqui, representing a petitioner, questioned how the issue could be decided without hearing the aggrieved person.
Justice Jahangiri introduced himself at the rostrum and reiterated that, as the affected party, he had a fundamental right to be heard.
Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed pointed out that Justice Memon was also part of a division bench that, in September last year, had suspended KU’s cancellation order.
He added that the matter had originally been fixed before another constitutional bench headed by Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed for Sept 30, but was later transferred without explanation to the present bench.
He argued that the matter should return to CB-II, as transfers of cases are the domain of a three-judge committee, and questioned how a constitutional bench could override an administrative order. Advocate Siddiqui also argued that the case should be heard by a regular bench rather than a constitutional bench.
The petitioners’ lawyers further questioned the SHEC’s urgent application, arguing that the commission itself had admitted it had no role in the matter and should be removed as a respondent. They expressed surprise that the SHEC was now seeking an urgent hearing.
Justice Jahangiri told the bench that he had always upheld his oath as a high court judge, testifying that his degree was genuine. “I did not act as a puppet, nor did I make decisions at the behest of any sector commander,” he asserted.
The IHC judge, recently barred from exercising judicial powers by an IHC division bench, asked the SHC to grant him the right of hearing.
The petitioners and their lawyers, however, left after the bench maintained it would decide maintainability first.
Later, speaking to the media, Barrister Ahmed demanded that the bench recuse itself, voicing strong resentment over the transfer of the case, the conduct of the hearing and the court’s refusal to hear the aggrieved judge.
In a pointed remark aimed at the ruling PPP, he said: “The Sindh High Court should remain a court of law and not turn into a ‘People’s High Court’.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939320,GB to auction hunting permits for 118 animals - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"GILGIT: The Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) Wildlife and Parks Department will auction permits for 118 animals — including four Astore markhors, 100 Himalayan ibex, and 14 blue sheep — for the 2025–26 hunting season.
The bidding ceremony is scheduled to be held today (Wednesday) at the Forest, Parks and Wildlife Complex in Gilgit.
For the upcoming season, the base price of an Astore markhor permit has been raised to $200,000, while
blue sheep and Himalayan ibex
permits are set at $30,000 and $10,000, respectively.
Last year, the base rates were lower: $150,000 for markhor, $9,000 for blue sheep, and $5,500 for ibex. In the 2024-25 season, 118 permits were offered, but only 60 were purchased. The highest bid for a markhor reached $161,000, earning the GB government more than Rs30 million.
Officials note that prices in other regions, such as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, can reach $500,000 for markhor hunts. However, local outfitters and tour operators argue the sharp fee hikes are damaging their businesses and discouraging international clients. They warn of losses for both outfitters and the local communities who rely on trophy hunting revenue.

Ikram Beg, a Gilgit-based outfitter, said participation in the programme has dropped due to inflated rates, causing “devastating” impacts on livelihoods.
Similarly, Syed Sumsam Ali Bokhari, chairman of Safari Club International Pakistan Chapter, warned that rising prices undermine Pakistan’s competitiveness compared to neighbouring countries.
In Tajikistan, a markhor hunt costs about $160,000 including logistics; in Nepal, blue sheep hunts average $29,000; and ibex hunts in Central Asia range between $8,500 and $9,900.
Mr Bokhari added that security concerns, geopolitical tensions, and recent terrorist attacks in hunting regions such as Chitral further reduced the country’s attractiveness as a destination.
He urged the GB wildlife department to reconsider its pricing strategy to align with regional market trends.
Launched in 1990 in Bar Valley, Nagar, GB’s trophy hunting programme involves local communities, who receive about 80 per cent of hunting revenues for conservation and development projects.
While it has been credited with protecting endangered species, stakeholders fear the latest price hikes could jeopardise its sustainability.

on Narrative Building
Senate committee alarmed by misuse of Peca by provinces
ISLAMABAD: The government has notified a special panel — comprising clerics, religious leaders of non-Muslim communities and senior officials — to counter extremism, hate speech, terrorism and sectarianism in the country.
The Ministry of Information has set up the National Paigham-i-Aman Commit­tee (NPAC), which will draft a unified national stance against extremism and terrorism.
The NPAC, a subcommittee of the National Committee on Narrative Building (NCNB), has been tasked with devising a unified national narrative that promotes peace, harmony and religious moderation.
The NCNB, which was notified earlier this month, is a 20-member body that includes the information ministers of all four provinces, GB and AJK, as well as federal minister. It also includes representatives of the military, intelligence agencies, the foreign and IT ministries, as well as the PTA chairman.
It is meant to deal with “information operation, formulation, dissemination, propagation and evaluation of [the] national narrative against the spread of terrorism [or] extremism through media, communication and cyber networks for smooth implementation of Revised National Action Plan 2021,” according to a notification.
Meanwhile, the director general of the Internal Publicity Wing of the information ministry will serve as the NPAC secretary, while Maulana Tahir Ashrafi has been appointed its coordinator.
The committee’s first meeting will focus on formulating its terms of reference, which will be submitted to the NCNB for approval.
Speaking to
Dawn
, Allama Arif Wahidi said the committee could be seen as an extension of the Paigham-i-Pakistan initiative, launched in 2018. “The Paigham-i-Pakistan narrative was the theoretical step to counter religious extremism. The target of this committee is to implement the idea and devise practical steps to stop the dividing forces in society,” he said, adding that these steps would also be implemented by provinces.
Allama Tahir Ashrafi told
Dawn
that the move reflected the government’s intent to adopt a more inclusive and strategic approach to peacebuilding through institutional coordination. He added that the initiative aims to centralise national efforts to craft and disseminate a cohesive narrative countering extremism in multiple dimensions — religious, sectarian and ideological.
Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee voiced reservations after being informed that provinces were still registering
cybercrime cases
under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), despite amendments barring them from doing so.
The Senate Standing Committee on Information, while reviewing the implementation of Peca, expressed concern that the law was being misused.
Director general of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed the committee, chaired by Senator Syed Ali Zafar, that 10 journalists were currently facing cases under Peca, adding that 611 cases of financial fraud and 320 of harassment were also under investigation.
The committee members noted that under
recent amendments
, the provinces were no longer authorised to register cases under to Peca 2025, which must now be referred to the NCCIA. The officials said that any cases filed by provincial authorities after the amendment were invalid. “All these cases are illegal — now what should we do with them?” asked the committee chairman.
The lawmakers decided to form a subcommittee to review the issue of illegal case registrations. Senator Zafar ruled that 378 cases registered under Peca by provincial authorities were unlawful and should be withdrawn immediately.

The “document has been issued by the US”, he said during a press conference in Islamabad, seemingly distancing the Pakistan’s decision-makers from the plan.
“This is not our document, which we sent to them. There are some key areas that we want covered … If they are not covered, they will be covered” he said, adding that the immediate objectives of the plan were to ensure a ceasefire, “stop the bloodshed, let the humanitarian aid flow and end forced displacement”.
Consider Trump’s announcement of the 20-point plan as “an announcement from their side”, he added.
“We have issued a joint statement on behalf of eight countries [that held a meeting with Trump in New York last week]. We own this. If there is any difference anywhere, we would go by — we are committed to this (joint statement).” he emphasised.
Later, speaking on
Geo News
show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath’, he reiterated that the plan’s draft released by the White House did “not include all of our proposals”.
The Muslim leaders’
meeting
with Trump was held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, where the US president discussed his plan for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. The moot included leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia.
Later, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had expressed optimism about the meeting’s outcomes and welcomed Trump’s plan as the US president met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House yesterday. In a joint press conference following that, Trump had announced Netanyahu’s agreement to the 20-point plan and particularly thanked PM Shehbaz and army chief Asim Munir for their support.
‘Yet to decide on sending troops’
Earlier in the press conference, Dar outlined PM Shehbaz’s and his own engagements on the sidelines of the UNGA session.
He said the visit of Pakistan’s delegation to the US had two main purposes —  one pertaining to activities at the UNGA and the other to work with some “like-minded countries” on trying to end the misery in Gaza as a “member of the Muslim ummah”.
“The prime minister was very clear [about it]. We had had consultations before leaving [for the US] as well. And eight countries, including Pakistan, agreed to take up this matter very proactively with President Trump during the US visit,” he said.
Dar said a preparatory meeting was held before Muslim leaders’ moot with Trump.
He added that the meeting with Trump was held with the objectives to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid to the strip without any hurdles, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of those displaced from the Gaza, plan for Gaza’s reconstruction and stop Israel’s attempts to annex the West Bank.
“When these objectives were conveyed to him (Trump) and he was asked to work with us on achieving them,” Dar said, adding that the US president then proposed that his team would devise a “workable solution” with the foreign ministers of the eight Muslim countries that participated in the meeting.
He said it was decided that the details of meetings held in this regard would be “secret” and “classified”.
After sharing further details of how the proposal for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza was finalised, Dar said he had received messages from the Saudi foreign minister yesterday.
“He told me that five countries had reached a consensus on joint statement [regarding the Gaza plan] and that our agreement was needed on this matter as well, and that they had also reached out to Indonesia and the UAE.
“I then consulted the foreign secretary and proposed some changes. I spoke to the Saudi foreign minister again … as I had some objections … He then send me a revised version … and the joint statement was released.”
Dar highlighted that the Palestinian Authority had also welcomed the statement.
“On the one hand, the Palestinian Authority is welcoming this and on the other, [some over here] are criticising it,” he continued, apparently referring to strong reactions from some quarters to Trump’s peace plan.
Asked whether Pakistan would be deploying any troops in Gaza under the 20-point plan, he replied: “The idea is to have an independent Palestinian government of technocrats there. Then there will be an international oversight body, which, too, will mostly comprise Palestinians. Or, as you know, Tony Blair has been making efforts in this regard. He hasn’t been successful till now, but he might get an opportunity now.
“The force [here] is [a] peace-keeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies … there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan’s leadership will also be making a decision on this.
“And we have asked them to document the arrangement, whatever it is, at the [UN] Security Council … This will be a special force only for Gaza.”
When asked to assure that “you still believe in the two-state solution”, he said Pakistan’s policy was clear and unchanged on Gaza. “And I rather would say the seven other countries are also with us on this.”
To another question, he asserted that there would be no compromise on stopping the annexation of the West Bank.
To query about whether Israel would “own” the Trump plan, he said the sole reason the US had been involved in the matter was to ensure this.
He was later asked about Hamas’ agreement to the proposal as well on
Geo News
programme ‘Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath’. In his reply, Dar said two Arab countries “deeply involved” with Hamas had assured that it was on board regarding the Gaza plan.
Asked which two countries were these and whether they included Qatar, the foreign minister refused to reveal much but did consent that one of them was Qatar.",2025-09-30,Dawn.com,1486,0.000171

Meanwhile, three people lost their lives in rain-related incidents, which included two teenagers, who lost their lives due to electrocution during the downpour.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said that a deep depression system that was to cause rain in the city had weakened into a depression that was now lying over central Sindh. It would continue to move nearly west/ southwest-ward and gradually further weaken into a well-marked low pressure area during next 12 hours, the PMD added.
“Due to this system strong monsoon currents are continually penetrating in the province. Under its influence, widespread rain-wind/ thundershower with strong gusty winds along with scattered heavy to very heavy/ isolated exceptional
heavy falls are expected in … Karachi division till tomorrow with occasional gaps.”

A young man drowned in rain-filled Malir Nadi (river) while another was rescued on Tuesday evening, according to officials.
Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan said that two men were trying to cross the Malir Nadi at Yar Mohammed Goth.
There was a heavy flow of water because of the accumulation of rainwater apart from quicksand. They were stuck up in it.
The feet of one of the victims, identified as Ali Gul Mithani was stuck in quicksand who controlled himself with the help of something and was rescued, while a heavy flow of water took away another man, namely Irfan Ahmed Tarin, 27.
The rescue team continued the operation till late evening but could not find him.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah directed Malir deputy commissioner for personal supervision of the operation. He directed the DC to inform residents in adjoining areas of Malir river for situations developing there due to rain and ensure the protection of life and property.
Later, K-Electric issued a statement maintaining that preliminary investigations showed its “infrastructure was not involved” in either of the incidents.
Malir village flooded
On the directives of the Sindh CM, rescue teams were dispatched to Khameso Jokhio Goth in Malir after rain and overflowing water from the Malir River entered residential areas.
Acting on the chief minister’s instructions, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah directed the commissioner to mobilise Rescue 1122, according to the CM’s spokesperson.
The Malir DC also proceeded to the affected site.
The CM instructed officials to ensure full assistance for the residents and ordered that all villagers be shifted to safe locations.
Tariq Road declared no-parking zone
Earlier, the city’s traffic police took the pre-emptive measure of declaring both sides of Tariq Road “no-parking zone”.
The traffic police posted on X that the Met Office had predicted heavy rain and urban flooding for September 9 (today), in view of which “citizens,  as well as all market associations, their members, and administrations are informed that both sides of Tariq Road have been declared no-parking zone”.
The police said the step was taken so that Tariq Road could be used as an alternative route in case Sharea Faisal, one of the city’s main arteries, “is affected”.
“Citizens, especially market associations and members, are requested to avoid parking on both sides of Tariq Road so that traffic flow is not hampered.”
Earlier in the morning, the traffic police reported drizzle in parts of the city.
It advised commuters to exercise caution and warned them of slippery roads.
The traffic police also advised people against travelling to low-lying areas.
Meanwhile, Karachi Additional Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho instructed zonal deputy inspector generals and district senior superintendent of police to brief their subordinates and relevant officials about assistance that was to provide in case of rain. He also directed them to coordinate with all relevant departments.
According to a statement issued by the police, he further asked them to inform the residents of low-lying areas, especially those living alongside rivers and nullahs, about the weather situation so that precautionary measures could be taken.
“All possible cooperation with the traffic police should be ensured,” he said, adding that alternative routes to the ones affected by rain should be checked.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s (CM) House said the city administration was put on alert on the directives of CM Murad Ali Shah.
It quoted Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah as saying that district administrations and local body departments should “go out in the field” to assist citizens and stay prepared for the rain spell.

Mayor details preparatory measures
On Monday, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab addressed a
press conference
, where he detailed precautionary measures taken in view of the rain forecast.
He said that despite precautionary measures, it was inevitable the city would take “a few hours” to recover after each downpour .
Outlining the city’s preparedness, limitations and political landscape amid the ongoing monsoon spell predicted to continue through Sept 8-10.
“The sea level is high — it might not take the water,” he explained, adding that this natural phenomenon was among the city’s biggest challenges during heavy rainfall.
Highlighting the city’s preparedness, the mayor claimed that all 46 major drains (nullahs) under Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) leading to the sea had been “cleaned”, including the Gujjar, Orangi and Mehmoodabad nullahs.
“Additional pumps have been installed, machinery deployed, and 120 water and sewerage vehicles are active across the city,” he said.
Relief camps have been set up at key choke points to provide stranded citizens with water and biscuits, and municipal staff leave has been cancelled to ensure 24/7 field presence.
The mayor urged residents to remain calm and patient, advising them not to rush out during the rain.
Last month, 15 people were
killed
as rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet service outages, which continued late into the day, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery.
Most of the deaths occurred due to collapsing structures, drowning and electrocution during the three days of rain, according to hospital officials.",2025-09-09,Dawn.com,2028,0.000212

Astore DHO Dr Nawab Ahmed Khan said that the 750 cases were reported over four days, though 90 per cent of them are now under control.
“I applied 60 drips to a single patient from morning until night,” Dr Khan said. “Several drips were also administered even after the patient left the hospital.”
On August 30, Astore’s District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) reported a sudden influx of gastroenteritis patients displaying symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting, according to a report by the deputy commissioner, available with
Dawn.com
.
The report stated that the patients hailed from the areas of Pattipura, Lous, Chongrah, Eidgah, Government Colony, Gorikot, Parishing and Shounter. No fatalities were reported as of today.
“[A] preliminary medical opinion indicated a waterborne source,” the report stated.’
On August 30, 80 cases were reported at DHQ Astore, with 150 patients admitted the following day. On August 31, eight cases were referred to facilities in Gilgit. The report showed that by September 1, the number of patients admitted at DHQ Astore and medical camps rose to a cumulative 450.
According to the DC’s report, water tanks and supply lines were inspected between August 30 and 31, with supplies suspended overnight “as a precaution”. Tanks were cleaned and disinfected on August 31, with four out of eight samples testing positive for cholera.
In light of this, the report noted, the district administration temporarily arranged for the distribution of water tankers and bottled water. Additionally, standard operating procedures were put in place to regularly chlorinate water tanks.
“District Astore has moved from rapid escalation to early stabilisation, with case numbers declining today,” the report read. “The response architecture — medical surge, water-sanitation interventions, network enforcement, targeted risk communication and multi-agency coordination — is fully activated.”
The report noted that the core risk remains infrastructure-related contamination and historic chlorination lapses, which are “being addressed on priority with defined accountability”.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939976/justice-shah-asks-cjp-afridi-to-publicly-answer-6-questions-on-pressing-institutional-concerns,Justice Shah asks CJP Afridi to publicly answer 6 questions on ‘pressing institutional concerns’ - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Supreme Court Justice Mansoor Ali Shah has written a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi asking him to publicly answer six questions regarding “pressing institutional concerns”, it emerged on Friday.
In a letter dated Thursday, seen by
Dawn.com
, Justice Shah said he was reluctantly writing it in “discharge of an unavoidable institutional duty”, adding that what compelled him was “your (CJP’s) persistent and complete indifference”.
The judge wrote that his “repeated letters and written communications to you (CJP) on the undermentioned issues have gone unanswered and undiscussed; not once have I received a reply-neither in writing nor verbally”, adding that such silence from the chief justice to the senior puisne judge was “not merely discourteous; it undermines the collegial traditions of this court and violates the institutional courtesy without which a constitutional court cannot function”.
Justice Shah said that with the new judicial year commencing from Monday, CJP Afridi had convened a judicial conference to review the reforms undertaken under his leadership and to lay down priority areas for the coming year.
“It is therefore both timely and opportune that the institutional concerns I raise in this letter be addressed squarely by you in that forum. By doing so, you will not only respond to the questions that remain unanswered but also reassure the judges of this court, the bar and the public we serve that your vision of reform is grounded in collegiality, transparency, and fidelity to the Constitution.”
The questions the judge asked the CJP to answer were:
Why has the Practice and Procedure Act Committee never been convened
to carry out its statutory responsibilities?
Why was the
revision
of the Supreme Court Rules 1980 approved by circulation rather than after discussion and deliberation in a Full Court meeting?
Why was the policy on releasing dissenting opinions adopted by soliciting individual opinions of the judges — saying it was a process “unheard of” — rather than an open deliberation in a Full Court meeting?
Why was a
General Standing Order
(GSO) on leave issued that subjects judges to controls inconsistent with judicial independence and the Presidential Order of 1997?
Why have the
petitions challenging
the 26th Amendment not been fixed before the original Full Court?
If CJP Afridi was nurturing independence among judges or “enforcing compliance to turn this court into a regimented force rather than a constitutional court of free and equal judges?”
Justice Shah said the letter must not be construed as a “personal grievance”.
“The concerns I now raise do not come from indolence or neglect, but from a judge who has consistently and conscientiously performed his duty. They are, therefore, institutional concerns borne of experience and responsibility rather than personal complaint,” he explained.
Justice Shah said that he trusted CJP Afridi to use the judicial conference as a “moment of institutional renewal by answering these questions and reaffirming the principles of collegiality and constitutional fidelity”.
Justice Shah said the questions were those that struck at the “heart of independence” and not only the apex court judges, but also the nation, were looking towards CJP Afridi “not for silence but for clarity”.
Concerns about PaPA Committee
Elaborating on his questions, Justice Shah said the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, was enacted by the apex court to put an end to the “one-man show” in the formation of benches.
He pointed out that it required that all causes, matters, petitions, appeals or reviews be placed before benches constituted by a committee under the act, adding that its purpose was “clear”: to review pending cases, devise a transparent case-management plan, categorise cases intelligently and allocate them to benches through collective deliberation.
“Yet, since your assumption of office in October 2024, not a single official meeting of the PaPA Committee has been convened. Bench formation and cause lists are being issued unilaterally, without any committee deliberation. Rosters are circulated for signatures, expecting members to endorse them blindly without discussion of case allocation or categorisation. As a senior member of the committee, I have had no opportunity to participate in its work as mandated by law.
“This is a direct violation of the act and raises serious concerns. Why are junior judges regularly assigned to three-member benches while senior judges are confined to two-member benches? Why are matters of national importance with far-reaching policy implications not fixed before senior benches? The pattern suggests that independent judges are being sidelined, not for reasons of efficiency, but for reasons of control.”
Justice Shah said that minutes of five “committee meetings” displayed on the court’s website could not “cure this defect”, arguing that “they were not committee meetings within the meaning of the act but mere discussions about the chief justice’s travel schedule. Even then, their minutes were uploaded in violation of a binding majority decision of the committee. I had recorded my dissent on that occasion, arguing for transparency, but it was disregarded. This is symptomatic of a mindset averse to collegiality and inclined towards dictation.”
The judge rued that “the genie of the ‘one-man show’, which Parliament sought to bury through legislation, has been released once again”, adding that that was the reason why he had ceased signing the rosters circulated without any meeting.
“By sidelining the committee and withholding even basic information (such as the number of cases to be dealt with or those fixed before larger benches), you have reduced a statutory mechanism of collective decision-making into a façade.
“The result is evident: despite the increase in the number of judges, the court’s pendency remains at 57,455 cases. The very purpose of enhancing the court’s strength — reducing backlog — stands defeated. The unavoidable inference is that enlargement of the court was less about addressing pendency and more about altering its internal balance, thereby diluting the independence and standing of existing judges.”
Revision of court rules
Regarding the
revision
of the apex court’s rules, Justice Shah said they were a constitutional document that governed the institution’s functioning and their first revision in four decades was an event of “historic significance”.
He argued that such a process required a Full Court meeting on the administrative side. “Instead, you chose to approve the draft rules by circulation — a process suited to routine matters, not to reshaping the court’s constitutional framework.
“By avoiding deliberation, you deprived the court of collective wisdom and diminished judicial dialogue. This course reflects a lack of collegiality and a preference for unilateral authority.”
Policy on dissenting opinions
Regarding dissenting opinions, Justice Shah said the court’s recent policy on releasing them with the majority judgment was approved through a unique process of soliciting the views of individual judges by the registrar.
He said there was no “legal or institutional basis for individual opinion-gathering on such critical matters”, unless specifically authorised by the Full Court, and even then, only for matters that were procedural or minor in nature.
Justice Shah said the above exercise could not be treated as a substitute for Full Court deliberation, nor could responses to this letter be used to formulate policy in isolation.
“A matter of jurisprudential weight was reduced to a secretive tick-box exercise and the court was denied the richness of open deliberation.
“A Full Court meeting is not merely a procedural formality — it is the bedrock of judicial collegiality. It allows all judges of this court to come together, to deliberate, to exchange ideas and, through open dialogue, to persuade or be persuaded. In such a forum, a judge may revise or refine their view after hearing their colleagues, or may help develop a collective wisdom that is far more robust than isolated responses. This essential element of judicial democracy is entirely lost when opinions are sought in writing and in silos.”
General Standing Order on leave
Justice Shah said that the GSO dated July 29, 2025, was the “first time” in the court’s history that something had dictated that judges were “whole-time” at the state’s disposal, adding that this was language “wholly alien” to a constitutional court.
“Judges are not regimented officers; their independence is constitutionally entrenched.”
The judge said the GSO had confined foreign leaves to five categories, but this was a restriction not envisaged in Presidential Order No. 2 of 1997.
“In principle, leave can, if at all, only possibly be considered for refusal where: (i) a part-heard case cannot be adjourned; (ii) urgent administrative duty demands presence; or (iii) a judge is negligent in work and seeks leave to evade it. Yet, in practice, leave is being denied even when none of these circumstances exist-apparently to enforce compliance and control, and to prevent independent judges from speaking at international forums. Such arbitrary denials betray a deep institutional insecurity.”
Justice Shah further railed that the newly introduced requirement under the GSO that a judge must disclose his residential address and contact details was “alien” to the practice of constitutional courts worldwide.
“It borrows from the ethos of civil-service bureaucracy and attempts to transplant it into the judiciary, with deeply corrosive consequences. A judge of this court is not a supervised functionary of the state but a constitutional actor whose independence is both decisional and personal. To compel disclosure of a judge’s private residence is not administration — it is surveillance. It reduces the dignity of the office to that of a monitored employee and cloaks an instrument of control in the garb of procedure.
“No constitutional court of repute — the US Supreme Court, the UK Supreme Court, or the Constitutional Court of South Africa — has ever imposed such a condition. You may not realise it, but by imposing it here, you are striking at the very independence of this court. A judiciary under watch ceases to be a judiciary; it becomes an extension of bureaucracy. Kindly note that no apex court of repute across jurisdictions mandates such disclosure, precisely because the ethos of independence demands institutional courtesy, not surveillance.”
The senior puisne judge pointed out that the GSO had been “weaponised to create a judicial ‘exit control list’”.
He noted that leave was no longer a matter of “respect and consultation but of bureaucratic obstruction”, adding that it was an “authoritarian impulse that undermines judicial independence”.
The judge further pointed out that “disturbingly, these rigid policies bear the imprint of the civil bureaucracy. The registrar — a retired civil servant — appears to be driving an agenda alien to the ethos of a constitutional court. Judges are not governed by the logic of command and control but by independence and collegiality. Judges are not mere agents of government; they are guardians of the people’s liberties.”
Supreme Court’s legitimacy
Lastly, Justice Shah said the apex court and CJP Afridi’s legitimacy “hangs in the balance” in the pending petitions challenging the 26th Amendment.
He pointed out that the petitions remained unheard for nearly a year, though they concerned the Supreme Court’s independence.
“They must be heard by the original Full Court, excluding judges elevated after the amendment. Until then, any initiative under your leadership remains institutionally fragile, for its foundation is constitutionally suspect. True leadership lies not in managing compliance but in ensuring that the court rises above suspicion as the fearless guardian of the Constitution,” the senior puisne judge concluded.",2025-09-05,Umer Mehtab,2999,0.000285
https://www.dawn.com/news/1944528/pakistan-calls-for-ai-to-be-regulated-under-un-charter-warns-against-military-application,"Pakistan calls for AI to be regulated under UN charter, warns against military application - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","Pakistan has called for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to be regulated by the United Nations charter, particularly its military use, warning that “AI must not become a tool of coercion.”
As artificial intelligence advances without meaningful checks, Pakistan’s call at the UN reflects wider concerns voiced by developing nations that powerful states will shape the rules to their advantage.
Earlier this year, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)
adopted
a resolution urging inclusive and equitable AI governance that bridges the digital divide, while countries in the Global South, from
Indonesia
to
Brazil
, have warned that unchecked deployment risks deepening inequalities.
Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, while speaking at a high-level debate on AI under the agenda item ‘Maintenance of international peace and security’ during the sidelines of the 80th UNGA session in New York, highlighted AI’s potential for misuse and called for the UN Charter and international law to “fully govern the development and use of AI applications”.
”AI must not become a tool of coercion, or technological monopoly,“ the state-run
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)
quoted him as saying.
The
APP
reported that the meeting was chaired by South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung, as the country holds the 15-member Council’s presidency for September.
Warning against AI’s military applications, the minister stressed that while AI may be the “most consequential, dual-use technology,” it also has the potential to deepen “inequalities, and destabilizing international order.”
“Applications, without meaningful human control, should be prohibited,” he added while addressing the 15-member council.
Noting the perils of unregulated AI, Asif pointed out that, “Unregulated and irresponsible use of AI enables disinformation campaigns, offensive cyber operations, and development of new types of armaments.“
“The accelerating weaponisation of AI, through autonomous weapon systems, and AI-driven command and control systems, poses a grave danger.”
He urged the states to “commit to measures that prevent destabilising use, and pre-emptive incentives.”
Referring to the four-day military
standoff
between India and Pakistan in May, Asif noted that during the conflict, “autonomous munitions and high-speed dual-capable cruise missiles were used by one nuclear-armed state against another during a military exchange,” cautioning that the instance demonstrates the “dangers that AI can pose.”
Warning against the changing future of warfare, he said, “AI lowers the threshold for use of force, making wars more politically and operationally feasible.”
AI “compresses decision-time, narrowing the window for diplomacy and de-escalation,” the minister cautioned, adding that AI also “blurs domain boundaries, merging cyber, kinetic, and informational effects in unpredictable ways.”
He called for AI use to promote “peace and development” rather than “conflict and instability.”
“Let us preserve the primacy of human judgment, in matters of war and peace, ensuring that, even in an age of intelligent machines, innovation is guided by principles of morality and humanity,“ Asif said.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who opened the debate, while highlighting the many uses of AI along the lines of food insecurity, de-mining, and violence outbreaks, cautioned that, “Without guardrails, it can also be weaponised.“
AI is “no longer a distant horizon — it is here, transforming daily life, the information space and the global economy at breathtaking speed,“ he said; however, “innovation must serve humanity — not undermine it.”
Recalling the establishment of the UN’s Independent International Scientific Panel on AI and a Global Dialogue on AI Governance, Guterres remarked, “humanity’s fate cannot be left to an algorithm” as “humans must always retain authority over life-and-death decisions”.
On that note, he called on the council and the member states to “ensure that human control and judgment are preserved in every use of force,”
APP
quoted him as saying.
Gueterres further called for “a ban on lethal autonomous weapons systems operating without human control, with a legally binding instrument by 2026,”
APP
reported.
“Similarly, any decision in nuclear weapon use must rest with humans — not machines”,
APP
quoted the UN Secretary General as saying.
“From nuclear arms control to aviation safety, the international community has risen to the challenge of technologies that could destabilise our societies —by agreeing to rules, building institutions, and insisting on human dignity,” he said.
“The window is closing to shape AI — for peace, for justice, for humanity. We must act without delay.”
Addressing the council, Yejin Choi, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence, pointed out that the “current progress in AI is too concentrated among a handful of companies and countries.”
“When only a few have the resources to build and benefit from AI, we leave the rest of the world waiting at the door,” she said.
“Let us expand what intelligence can be — and let everyone everywhere have a role in building it.”
“Ms Choi urged governments and international institutions to invest in alternative approaches beyond scaling ever-larger models, arguing that smaller, more adaptive systems could lower barriers to entry,”
APP
reported.
“She also pressed for stronger representation of linguistic and cultural diversity, noting that today’s leading AI models underperform for many non-English languages and reflect narrow cultural assumptions.”
The development comes a day after Google
announced
the rollout of its “Google AI Plus plan” in 40 more countries, including Pakistan.
“Pakistan’s digital landscape is vibrant and growing, and we’ve been inspired by the creativity Pakistanis have shown in adopting AI tools,” said the Country Director of Google Pakistan, Farhan Qureshi, in a statement.
In July, the federal cabinet
approved
the National AI Policy 2025.
The policy outlined training a million AI professionals by 2030, establishing an AI Innovation Fund and AI Venture Fund to boost private sector involvement, creating 50,000 AI-driven civic projects and 1,000 local AI products in the next five years.
“Our youth are Pakistan’s greatest asset. Providing them with education, skills, and equal opportunities in AI is a top priority,” PM Shehbaz said while chairing the July meeting.",2025-09-25,APP,1614,0.000181

• Targets Rs500bn annual revenue; Rs50bn increase recorded last year
ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan is planning to lease out precious right-of-way (RoW) of motorways and national highways to “generate funds”.
“A coordinated and uniform policy should also be implemented for the commercial use of NHA (National Highway Authority) land on both sides of motorways and national highways, which should be outsourced and reviewed every three months,” the minister was quoted as saying in an official press release issued by the NHA after he presided over a meeting on the authority’s affairs.
Several years ago, the then management of the NHA had also leased out RoW of the many motorways, including the M2 (Islamabad-Lahore Motorway), after which a mashroom growth of commercial outlets could be witnessed in rest areas along the road.
The communication minister directed the NHA to ensure an integrated audit system, improve financial discipline, and adopt fundamental reforms aimed at transforming the organisation into a profitable, self-sustaining institution with an annual revenue target of Rs500 billion.
Chairing a high-level meeting at the NHA Headquarters, the minister expressed satisfaction over an unprecedented increase of Rs50bn in NHA’s own resources within the past year, terming it a historic milestone, adding that the authority would continue to enhance revenue each year.
He said the release of funds in the name of patchwork and repair was being stopped, as such funds were often misused for corruption.
“Now, instead of repairing in pieces, new construction of the roads will be undertaken so that it can have long-term benefits and proper utilisation of funds,” he added.
The minister further said the NHA should be restructured on the pattern of the corporate sector, seek support from qualified professionals from the private sector, and offer them attractive packages.
He stated that the performance of NHA officers would have to be evaluated against assigned targets, and those who met the targets would be rewarded with cash incentives.
He also ordered the permanent removal of encroachments on NHA
land and directed officials to focus resources and attention on the implementation of new projects, ensuring their timely completion.
The federal secretary for communications and the NHA chairman briefed the meeting on progress regarding the tasks assigned by the minister and the infrastructure development work completed so far.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941216/pti-senators-resign-from-standing-committees-in-compliance-with-imrans-orders,PTI senators resign from standing committees in compliance with Imran’s orders - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Several PTI senators have resigned from their respective senate standing committees on Thursday, saying that they had made the move in line with the instructions of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
So far, seven senators have quit the Senate standing committees, including Dost Muhammad, Zeeshan Khanzada, Mirza Muhammad Afridi, Muhammad Azam Khan Swati, Mohammad Humayun Mohmand, Falak Naz and Aon Abbas Buppi.
The development comes two weeks after the PTI claimed some 30 of its lawmakers
resigned
from the membership of parliamentary committees, although the National Assembly Secretariat only confirmed the receipt of 20 resignations.
The resignation letters of all seven senators, seen by
Dawn.com
, stated that the decision was made “voluntarily” upon the orders of Imran.
They resigned from all their respective standing committees, decrying Imran’s incarceration as well as the “disintegration of democratic norms” in the wake of the recent disqualification of PTI lawmakers.
Imran,
imprisoned
since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a
£190 million
corruption case and also faces
pending
trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
“I can no longer in good conscience serve on Senate committees when the state is the foremost violator of the very rights and protections these committees are meant to safeguard,” Swati wrote in his letter.
Citing the recent disqualification of PTI lawmakers, he stated that the authorities were “systematically dismantling” the foundations of democracy, the judiciary, and basic rights of citizens.
He pointed out that the “breakdown began with a deeply flawed judgment authored by Justice Qazi Faez Isa,” stripping PTI of its symbol — the bat, followed by the “abuse of Form-47” during the 2024 general elections.
“This resignation is an act of protest not just on behalf of my party, but to faithfully follow the decision of my party leader Imran Khan, the Law of this great country and the Constitution of Pakistan, which today stands orphaned, dishonoured, and ignored.”
Swati urged parliamentarians, jurists, and citizens to speak up “before the space for dissent is completely extinguished.”
Meanwhile, both Senator Khanzada and Dost Muhammad stated in their letters: “The deliberate denial of Justice has compelled both him and myself to take this step as an expression of protest.”
Buppi, Afridi, Mohmand, and Falak Naz, in their letters, said that they were also resigning following the directions of Imran Khan.
Mohmand, in his statement, criticised the state, saying that “the lawful avenue through which we can register [our] complaint has been blocked,” citing the
26th Constitutional Amendment.
The senators resigned from the following committees:
Swati — cabinet secretariat, economic affairs, law and justice, national health services, regulation and coordination, and rules of procedure and privileges.
Dost Muhammad — government assurances, human rights, national food security & research, poverty alleviation and social safety, and railways.
Khanzada — Overseas Pakistanis & human resource department, foreign affairs, finance, commerce, and privatisation.
Afridi — commerce, federal education and professional training, inter-provincial coordination, industrial and production, and power.
Buppi — Industries & production, poverty alleviation & social safety, religious affairs and interfaith harmony, defence production, and information and broadcasting.
Mohmand — parliamentary affairs, human rights, national health services and regulation, water resources, information technology and telecommunication.
Falak Naz — federal education & professional training, economic affairs, climate change, and problems of less developed areas.
Last month, PTI lawmakers
resigned
from membership and chairmanship of all standing committees in the National Assembly as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in July and August disqualified a large number of PTI members and leaders in relation to their involvement in the

Shams ur Rehman is talking about his nine-year-old nephew Muhammad Azan, who has been staying with him and his family in Buner, a district in north-western Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Azan’s parents, as well as his three brothers, were killed when
flash floods
tore through the valley in the middle of August.
Also in Buner, 17-year-old Qadir Ahmed has to carry another burden. On 15 August, his family house collapsed in the floods. “The water carried away my mother… now, I must look after my [four] younger brothers and sisters.”
Not long ago, Ahmed passed his matriculation exams and aspired to go to college. Now, suddenly, he has to step in as the head of the family. “My education has stopped,” he says. “It is very difficult to take care of my siblings after losing our home and our mother.”
Pakistan has been experiencing unprecedented floods and landslides. The country’s National Disaster Management Authority (
NDMA
) reports that since late June, more than 1,000 people have been killed, with nearly 1,100 left injured due to monsoon-related disasters. Around half of all deaths have been in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where nearly
4,700
homes have been destroyed or damaged.
The floods have not spared other parts of the country. In Punjab, several major rivers faced large swells due to
historic
levels of rain in mid-August. Water discharges from across the Indian border have also contributed to villages and
farmlands
becoming submerged. More than two million people have been
evacuated
and
outbreaks
of skin- and water-borne diseases are expected. In the northern administrative territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, entire valleys have been
cut off
due to landslides, and more than 3,000 displaced people are staying in temporary camps. In Sindh, southern Pakistan, at least 150,000 people had been
evacuated
to safer areas as of 12 September.
Ahmed and Azan’s experiences are just two examples of how the floods in Pakistan are devastating the lives of children and causing trauma with long-lasting impacts.
Trauma without treatment
In Khalti village in Gilgit-Baltistan, Waseem Akram, a teacher, saw his private school shut down in mid-August when floods
washed away
houses and caused landslides that blocked roads. “Children are not going to school. They don’t have books, uniforms or shelter. Their behaviour has changed; they show anger, fear or silence,” he says, adding: “Many may drop out entirely.”
Muhammad Sohail, media coordinator for Rescue 1122, a government emergency service for disaster rescue, says that at present, Pakistan’s disaster response is focused only on physical rescue. “But mental health is just as important.”
He notes that systematic trauma care is practically unavailable. “Some officers are trained in Psychological First Aid, but there is no long-term counselling for children… This gap leaves scars that last for years.”
Fariha Sheikh is a social worker volunteering with the collection and distribution of food, period kits and other supplies in flood-hit villages on the outskirts of Sialkot and Narowal districts in Punjab, eastern Pakistan. She observes that children have been one of the most vulnerable groups. “Families are displaced, many of them living under open skies or in temporary shelters… kids from the villages have lost everything,” she says.
Some officers are trained in Psychological First Aid, but there is no long-term counselling for children… this gap leaves scars that last for years
“You can see the fear and uncertainty in their eyes… their normal life has just been snatched away,” she adds, noting that many are experiencing panic attacks.
Through her volunteer work, Sheikh has encountered children who have lost their parents. “It’s heartbreaking. Some kids don’t even fully realise what has happened, but they know their parents are not there anymore,” she says.
Added to these devastating upheavals are the physical dangers and changes they face. “Children are falling sick because of dirty water [from the floods] and a lack of food, and schools are either destroyed or being used as shelters,” Sheikh notes.
The trauma faced by children experiencing floods are exacerbated by the dangers they face from poverty, displacement and school closures. In Punjab alone, over 700,000 children have been affected by disruption to their education, with more than 2,900 schools forced to shut down due to the floods as of mid-September, according to
The Nation.
Unicef
warned
in the aftermath of Pakistan’s 2022 floods that the longer schools remained closed, the higher the risk of impacted children dropping out, which then increases the likelihood of them being forced into child labour and marriage.
When policies fail children
Amid the tragedy is the question of Pakistan’s lack of preparedness for such extreme weather. According to Yasir Darya, founder of environmental consultancy Darya Lab and the Karachi-based Climate Action Center, institutional failures have caused disasters to become even deadlier.
He highlights how early warning mechanisms planned after the 2022 flood did not come to fruition, and blames poor governance.
“Communities remain cut off and unprotected,” he says. “It is a societal crisis as much as a climate one.”
These failures mean greater devastation from extreme weather and climate events, which will continue to severely impact children’s mental health.
We don’t just need rations; we need proper houses, schools, hospitals, libraries and recreational spaces so children can feel normal again
Earlier this year, researchers coined the term “Environmentally driven Adverse Childhood Experiences (
E-ACEs
)” to refer to severe stressors children may face when exposed to prolonged, recurring or intense extreme weather and climate events. These can cause toxic stress similar to that seen in children experiencing abuse or neglect.
The researchers caution that repeated experiences with floods, displacement and family separation may impair their brain development and increase their vulnerability to long-term health risks. They also refer to climate-related adverse childhood experiences as a humanitarian crisis of the 21st century that particularly impact children of low- and middle-income countries such as Pakistan, where more people are being displaced.
Despite the clear need to protect children from climate change impacts, they remain largely absent from climate policies.
Analysis published this year by the Early Childhood Development Action Network (
ECDAN
) found that of the 10 countries expected to have the largest populations by 2100, only six, including Pakistan, mention children or youth in their national climate policies. And even these largely fail to address the specific needs of young children. In the case of Pakistan, references to children in its policies only focused on child mortality rates without addressing broader early childhood development needs, including the sustained provision of nutrition, education and healthcare during climate shocks.
In northern Pakistan, families such as those of Azan and Qadir see few signs of such planning. Displaced communities receive food and tents lasting just days, while education is disrupted for months, they told Dialogue Earth.
Beyond survival
Akram, the teacher, stresses that aid should not be limited to emergency tents and food, but focused on rebuilding, as young flood survivors need stability in their lives. “We don’t just need rations; we need proper houses, schools, hospitals, libraries and recreational spaces so children can feel normal again,” he says. “Otherwise, these children will lose their futures.”
Sheikh, the social worker, echoes these concerns, saying: “[Children] need food, clean water, medicines, but also safe spaces and care. Their mental and emotional state matters as much as their physical survival. For a child, losing home and safety is too much to carry.”
As the water begins to
recede
in parts of Pakistan, families returning to their homes look to the significant task of rebuilding. For many impacted children, the trauma they have experienced is evident. Azan now clings tightly to his uncle during storms.
Unless there is rapid investment in adaptation and trauma care, as well as the inclusion of children in national climate adaptation policies, Pakistan is at risk of raising a generation characterised not by its potential, but by its losses.

clashes
outside the Federal Judicial Complex (FJC).
Hours-long clashes took place between PTI workers and the Islamabad police on March 18, 2023, when former prime minister Imran Khan arrived at the FJC to attend a hearing in the first
Toshakhana case
, in which he was later
arrested
in August that year and has been behind bars since then.
The same day, the Punjab police personnel had entered Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore, which had also been the
venue
of a
chaotic stalemate
between the cops and the PTI just days before.
ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over today’s hearing. Advocate Sardar Masroof Khan, Amna Ali and others appeared as the legal team for the PTI leaders, while Advocate Sardar Muhammad Razzaq was present as former Punjab chief minister
Parvez Elahi’s
counsel.
The judge issued a bailable arrest warrant for Qaiser, ordering that he be produced before the court.
The judge accepted the applications seeking exemption from appearance for Elahi, former finance minister Asad Umar and PTI’s Shibli Faraz, who was recently
disqualified
from his role as the Senate opposition leader.
Subsequently, the judge adjourned the proceedings till October 6.
The case,
registered
at the Counter-Terrorism Department police station under Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997, had also named Imran.
A letter had been written to the law ministry about the proceedings against the ex-premier and a response was awaited.
ATA case over Federal Judicial Complex violence
As of March 22, 2023, the Islamabad Police had arrested a total of 316 PTI supporters for allegedly attacking police officers and causing chaos outside the FJC.
The case had also invoked sections 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc), 395 (punishment for dacoity), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage to amount of one hundred rupees), 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The first information report (FIR) named 18 people involved in causing damage to the FJC, 22 others involved in causing damage in the FJC’s parking area and lighting up fires, and 19 others involved in allegedly injuring police officials.

raided
17 locations to arrest lawyers nominated in a
case
registered following a clash with the president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA).
Police officials said that 70 lawyers were nominated in the case, along with 150 to 200 unidentified persons, in an FIR lodged at the Secretariat Police Station on the complaint of IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Shah Gillani.
After registration of the case, the police obtained arrest warrants. Later, separate police teams raided different places, including the residences of 11 lawyers nominated in the FIR.
By evening, 17 raids had been conducted in the capital, but all remained unsuccessful as the nominated individuals had gone into hiding to avoid arrest.
Footage from CCTV cameras installed in and around the IHC and Constitution Avenue was also being obtained and examined to identify others involved in the clash.
According to the FIR, Advocate Gillani went to the parking area outside the IHCBA office, where he spotted 60 to 70 people dressed in lawyers’ uniforms along with 150 to 200 unidentified persons. They were chanting slogans against the IHC chief justice, state institutions and the army.
Advocate Gillani asked the lawyers to refrain from such acts, but the mob ‘attacked and manhandled him’. They also allegedly ‘verbally abused’ him and threatened him with dire consequences.
Office-bearers and staff of the IHCBA rescued him, after which the group dispersed.
In a post on her X account, Shireen Mazari stated that at 1am a heavily armed police party from the Secretariat Police Station surrounded her house and asked for Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatha.
“They were not there and we informed them. Police said there was an FIR against them and they should report to the police station, and then they left,” she wrote.
In another post, Ms Mazari said that all videos of the IHC protest clearly showed the FIR charges were false, adding that eyewitness accounts also confirmed this.
“But the persecution of Imaan and Hadi has become a daily routine by the state. Ironic that PTI lawyers’ support got the IHC bar president elected,” she added.
Reportedly, lawyers had staged a protest on the IHC premises to oppose the
suspension
of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from judicial work.
However, tension flared when, after the demonstration, PTI-affiliated lawyers confronted the IHCBA president.

He said that the police had recently launched a crackdown on ‘harassment’, ‘vulgarity’ and ‘immoral’ activities, both online and on social media platforms, and had arrested many individuals. Such misleading posts, he added could be a reaction to that campaign.
“We will never allow a handful of TikTokers and social media influencers to sabotage the peaceful environment in our district through ‘immoral’ and socially unacceptable content. Our crackdown will continue without any interruption,” Mr Gandapur said.

More than 60 terrorist camps function as hubs for infiltration, targeting civilians, security forces and development projects inside Pakistan, he added.
The envoy said the threat extended to cyberspace, where nearly 70 propaganda accounts traced to Afghan IP addresses were spreading extremist messaging. “Curb­ing these networks requires full cooperation from social media platforms with governments,” he stressed.
Ambassador Ahmed said Pakistan and China had jointly asked the Security Council’s 1267 Sanctions Committee to designate the BLA and Majeed Brigade as terrorist organisations. He urged the Council to act swiftly on the request to curb their terrorist activities.
He also pointed to the TTP, describing it as the largest UN-designated group on Afghan soil with nearly 6,000 fighters. Pakistan, he said, had thwarted multiple infiltration attempts, seizing caches of sophisticated military equipment abandoned by international forces during their withdrawal from Afghanistan. “These efforts come at a heavy price … just this month,
12 Pakistani soldiers
were martyred in a single incident,” he noted.
He said that while four years of Taliban rule had ended decades of civil war, the country remained mired in sanctions, poverty, narcotics and human rights concerns.
He lamented that the UN’s 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan had received only 27pc of its required $2.42 billion.
The envoy reminded the Council that Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for over four decades, often with inadequate international assistance.

Sometimes it repeats as farce, sometimes as tragedy — and sometimes, in Pakistan, it comes back wearing the same last name.
The last time a Justice Dogar was in the news, the country was under military rule. When Musharraf imposed an emergency in November 2007, Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar
took oath
under a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) and validated his actions. After the judiciary was restored, contempt proceedings were initiated against Justice Dogar for endorsing the dictator’s actions and violating an order of the court. In
Abdul Hameed Dogar vs Federation (2011),
Justice Dogar claimed that his actions were, “under confusion, misconception and misunderstanding” He pleaded that he was “really sorry”. Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar, who had supported a military dictator, was ultimately required to place himself at the
mercy
of the post-restoration judiciary.
Nearly a decade later, the judiciary faces another crisis. This time, with Justice Sarfraz Dogar at the centre. On September 16, an Islamabad High Court (IHC) bench led by Justice Dogar
restrained
his fellow judge, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, from holding court and performing judicial functions. For context, Justice Jahangiri is a signatory to the six judges’ letter alleging executive interference in the judiciary, and was one of the petitioners challenging Justice Dogar’s transfer to the IHC.
Yesterday, five brave judges of the IHC fought back. The judges approached the highest court pleading that this was “a desperate measure of the last resort”, and that “there hangs a big question mark over whether we are being governed by rule of law or rule of men”. There is a powerful visual of the five judges entering the Supreme Court (SC) for justice. Justice Jahangiri appealed Justice Dogar’s order restraining him from holding court. The other judges challenged various administrative decisions taken by Justice Dogar, and questioned the ability of one High Court judge to restrain another from exercising judicial functions.
It bears mentioning that the present situation would not have been possible without the consent of the Chief Justice Yahya Afridi. It was CJP Afridi who gave his consent for the transfer of judges from other provinces to the IHC. There is, however, still time to reverse part of the damage that has been caused and stop further erosion of judicial independence.
Sidelining independent judges
When General Yahya Khan sought to restrain a judge from exercising judicial functions, the President’s Order No. 27 of 1970 was passed. As per Yahya Khan’s law, if the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) was inquiring into the conduct of a judge, the president could require the judge to go on leave.
When the Supreme Court was hearing Chaudhary Iftikhar’s case, it held: “Even General Yahya Khan, as the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator of the country never claimed any divine rights in the matter of suspending a Superior Court Judge or in the matter of restraining him from exercising his judicial powers and enacted a law for the purpose … whether it was during the constitutional and the democratic rule or whether it was during the days when martial law stood clamped in the country and the Constitution stood abrogated, the executive, including the head of the state never asserted any inherent powers to suspend judges or to send them on forced leave or even to restrain them from acting as such judges. Even during the martial law regimes when no constitutional security existed for the Judges guaranteeing them their tenure in office, the Presidents/the Chief Martial Law Administrators made specific legislative provisions for such a purpose.”
The law was eventually struck down.
Crucially, the SC, in Chaudhary Iftikhar’s case, went so far as to hold that a judge cannot be restrained from judicial work. Per this case, even the SJC did not have the power to order a judge to go on “leave”; the SJC can only render a report to the president that a judge be removed from office. The court ruled that even a temporary bar on a judge in the matter of discharging his constitutional duties amounts to removal, which is not permissible.
The order by Justice Dogar “restraining” Justice Jahangiri from holding court cites no legal provision in its support; he does not even attempt to explain the legal basis on which one high court judge could prevent another from exercising judicial functions, even on an interim basis. This is because there is no such authority. General Yahya Khan passed a law to shield his unconstitutional actions. Justice Dogar’s order mentions no law or authority.
The five IHC judges assert that the judges are being punished for decisions that members of the executive found disagreeable. When Justice Jahangiri was appointed head of the election tribunal for Islamabad constituencies, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) sought to replace him with a retired judge. Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani has been passing orders against the
executive
in cases of enforced disappearances. Justice Babar Sattar’s ruling that ordered the
removal
of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Chairman was suspended the very next day by a divisional bench. He was also prevented from proceeding in a case where he held that there is a mass surveillance system capable of monitoring millions of citizens.
Courageous decisions are being suspended, independent judges are being sidelined, and judicial independence itself is under siege.
Criminalising opposition
Lawyers at the IHC staged a protest on Friday against Justice Dogar’s actions. In the aftermath, Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) President Wajid Gilani registered an FIR against several lawyers. Instead of resisting executive interference in the judiciary, the IHCBA president chose to target lawyers who were standing up for judicial independence. The FIR includes provisions from anti-terrorism laws. This case joins the long list of cases in our regrettable history where terrorism laws have been misused to stifle opposition. The videos of the protest are widely available online for all to see what is being labelled as ‘terrorism’.
An independent bar association is vital to safeguard the judiciary from external pressures and to provide a collective voice for the legal community. A compromised bar association, on the other hand, enables and emboldens the executive.
Under this president, the IHCBA
withdrew
its support for the five judges who had challenged Justice Dogar’s transfer and seniority. In another remarkable
press conference
, the IHCBA president expressed his support and welcomed a 27th amendment to the Constitution; an amendment that has still not been made public was being eagerly supported. To date, the IHCBA has issued no statement condemning Justice Dogar’s recent actions. In this silence, and in the positions it has chosen instead, the association has revealed exactly where it stands.
The office of the President of the Bar carries trust, responsibility, and the duty to represent and defend the legal fraternity. By initiating criminal proceedings against fellow lawyers, those very values have been betrayed.
Approaching the Supreme Court
As the judiciary faces a moment of crisis, it falls to the SC and the chief justice to determine their course.
The independence of the courts is not an abstract principle — it is the foundation of every citizen’s right to justice. When that independence is undermined, so too is the protection of constitutional rights. An attack on independent judges is an attack on the very access to justice.
The time to act was when the 26th Amendment was passed. The Supreme Court did not. As we approach a year to the date the 26th Amendment was passed, the credibility of the judiciary has suffered considerably, and the destruction of judicial independence is evident. If the SC and the chief justice are to preserve what remains of institutional integrity, continued inaction can no longer be an option.",2025-09-20,Rida Hosain,2009,0.000211
https://www.dawn.com/news/1941763/no-end-to-hayatabad-medical-complex-visitors-misery-as-medics-continue-strike,No end to Hayatabad Medical Complex visitors’ misery as medics continue strike - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"PESHAWAR: A strike by doctors at the Hayatabad Medical Complex over a parking row with employees of the provincial tuberculosis control programme has left patients without elective services since last Thursday.
Health secretary Shahidullah Khan, who had ordered an inquiry into violence over the issue, said the matter would take a few more days to resolve as protesting doctors were unwilling to resume duties at the HMC, one of Peshawar’s three largest public hospitals.
“It [issue] will take some time to conclude,” the secretary told
Dawn.
With elective services suspended since Thursday, the doctors examine patients needing emergency care only.
Interestingly, the institution-based practice by doctors is available in the evening, with patients getting them examined after paying consultation fees.
Only emergency care available; secy says issue will take few more days to resolve
“The strike has not only benefited doctors doing IBP as private medical practitioners at HMC but the beneficiaries include private hospitals located in the nearby Phase V of Hayatabad Township as well,” a senior doctor told
Dawn.
He said he saw many patients go to private hospitals due to the strike as they couldn’t return without examination by HMC doctors as they had rented vehicles to get there from different cities.
HMC director Dr Sher Zaman said that inquiry would take one week to complete.
Only the gynaecology and paediatrics departments remained open during the strike.
On Tuesday, a trainee medical officer of the HMC had a brawl with a Class-IV employee of TCP over car parking that caused physical aggression between them.
The next day, the TMO was invited to TCP offices to resolve the issue but the situation turned violent after a heated discussion, with both sides starting assaulting each other, leaving doctors injured. Soon, HMC became a battleground as its and TCP employees had heated exchanges that led to violence.
The HMC medical director wrote a letter to the health secretary demanding closure of the TCP’s offices and action against its employees. The TCP offices, which stand on the HMC’s premises but are under the administrative control of the health department, were closed temporarily.
However, the strike, which started on Thursday, continued as doctors wanted to extend it next week.
Young Doctors Association president Dr Asfandyar Bittani demanded the termination of the TB programme’s director over “involvement” in violence against HMC doctors.
“We demand the relocation of the TCP’s offices from the HMC’s premises to allow the building to house the first-ever bone marrow transplant unit in the province,” he said.
Dr Bittani said the YDA would never make any “compromise” on its principled stand and would ensure punishment of those who tortured doctors.
Office-bearers of the Provincial Doctors Association and Insaf Doctors Forum also supported the strike and called for legal action against TCP employees.
The TCP officials demanded an impartial probe into the incident.
“Our 12 employees were illegally taken into custody from offices on Wednesday and were freed late at night as no FIRs were registered against them,” a senior official of the TB programme said.
He said the closure of TCP offices, which handled TB-related matters from across the province, hampered services.
Senior doctors said the ultimate sufferers of the situation were the patients as they continued to pay for treatment in private hospitals or under IBP at HMC instead of free or subsidised care at the hospital in the morning shift.

stripped
Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz of her powers to entertain harassment complaints when she took cognisance of a complaint against him.
Last week, Justice Dogar had
warned
Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had issued condemnatory statements and
called for the judge’s dismissal
from the post of the IHC top judge. Mazari then
filed
a complaint a day ago against the judge before the IHC’s workplace harassment committee and a reference for misconduct before the SJC.
After Justice Imtiaz took cognisance of her complaint, the IHC administration de-notified her as the “competent au­­thority” and replaced her with Justice Ina­­am Ameen Minhas, stripping Justice Imtiaz of her powers to entertain harassment complaints.
In a post on X today, Mazai said she had filed an addendum to her initial complaint lodged with the SJC against Justice Dogar following yesterday’s “alarming development”. She said Justice Imtiaz was “arbitrarily and with mala fide” removed as the competent authority just a  few hours after she had lodged her complaint and a committee was constituted to inquire into the matter.
The additional complaint, a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
, said various IHC organs — registrar office, dispatch branch and member inspection team — had refused to forward her complaint to the competent authority.
“The complaint was then taken directly to the competent authority … Her court associate confirmed receipt of the complaint by providing a receiving on a copy of the complaint in writing in the courtroom. Yesterday’s events showed absolute lack of transparency in relation to the process for registration of complaints under the 2010 act. Furthermore, it highlighted a systematic response/culture of courts, overwhelmingly occupied by men, to not even entertain a complaint of harassment by a woman under the 2010, Act. Eventually, the only female judge (being the competent authority) had to directly entertain the complaint through her staff, after all relevant male officers of the IHC, refused to even receive my complaint.”
Reiterating yesterday’s development, she said Justice Imtiaz had subsequently formed a three-member inquiry team, following which, Justice Dogar “with clear mala fide and in direct conflict of interest” had removed Justice Imtiaz as the competent authority and replaced her with Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas.
“No reason whatsoever has been provided in the removal notification. Even if the chief justice (who is a respondent in the complaint) had any objection on the assumption of jurisdiction by the competent authority or the inquiry committee, he could have raised it as an objection in his response to the complaint. Instead, the chief justice opted to exercise his administrative powers as the chief justice to influence the composition and constitution of the inquiry committee and/or competent authority to remove the only female judge, who dared to receive my complaint. Such brazen misconduct within hours after I attempted to seek appropriate remedy and justice is alarming, and reflects the degree of abuse of power prevalent under the IHC chief justice,” the additional request reads.
Mazari also pointed out that cases of hers which were previously not fixed for hearing, were suddenly fixed before Justice Dogar after she filed her complaint. She added that when a proxy counsel appeared on her behalf and requested a case transfer on the grounds of the  pending workplace harassment complaint, “not only was this request not entertained but the IHC chief justice repeatedly tried to drag the proxy counsel into discussion on the incident of harassment. The chief justice, while refusing the transfer request, simply on the basis that the principal counsel (the undersigned) had not appeared before him, then adjourned the matter.”
The lawyer also pointed out that she had additional documentation “reflecting the apparent degree of influence and abuse of authority by the IHC chief justice”, saying that soon after last week’s incident, a case was lodged against her in the National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority (NCCIA).
She said on Friday last week, a notification was issued by the Ministry of Interior nominating a special prosecution team in her case. Furthermore, she said a challan was submitted against her in a trial court yesterday and she came to know by media reports and then by a voice note sent by an NCCIA officer that she was summoned in the matter on Wednesday.
“At the time of filing this, I have yet to receive a summons/notice through formal court process. It appears to be more than a mere coincident that soon after the harassment incident and the filing of complaint, a challan in a case that involves incidents pertaining to past four years (i.e. 2021-2025) has hastily been filed in trial court and the trial court (working as subordinate judiciary under the IHC chief justice) has immediately fixed it for hearing.”
Mazari urged the SJC to read the additional complaint and documentation as part of her previous complaint against Justice Dogar. “I request the members of the SJC to take up my complaint and initiate proceedings against Mr Dogar at the earliest as such brazen misconduct and unchecked exercise of coercive power affects my legal practice and the clients I represent on a daily basis,” she concluded.
She made the following request to the SJC secretary: “Due to the dire nature of this complaint and the ensuing consequences, I urge you to convey the contents of this complaint to the honourable members of the SJC urgently upon receipt of this post.”
Reference seeking cancellation of Mazari’s licence filed in Islamabad Bar Council
Separately, a lawyer filed a reference before the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) seeking the cancellation of Mazari’s practising licence for her alleged involvement in “anti-state activities” and a “smear campaign against state functionaries”.
The reference, filed by Advocate Adnan Iqbal and a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
, stated: “The complainant has received some information from credible sources that Mst. Imaan Zainab Mazari Hazir has been involved on a number of occasions in anti-state activities like hate speeches against the state institutions and the honourable heads of government departments, negative and smear campaign against state functionaries and law enforcement agencies, and instigating hatred and rebellion against vital institutions of the state.”
It requested the IBC chairman and its disciplinary committee to initiate an inquiry against Mazari and “permanently cancel her licence to practice as an advocate”. “During the inquiry, her licence may kindly be suspended till final verdict of the worthy disciplinary committee,” it added.
The reference was filed under Section 41 of the
Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act 1973
(punishment of advocates for misconduct), read with Chapter X (disciplinary proceedings) of its
1976 rules
and the
Islamabad Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Rules 2017
.
The reference alleged there was “strong persuasive evidence” against Mazari for her “close connections with anti-state organisations”, such as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement leader Manzoor Pashteen.
“She has been supporting the cause of every movement which has the agenda of rebellion against the state and its vital institutions. She could be seen delivering speeches, chanting fiery slogans against the state and its institutions on every such stage adorned for launching anti-state campaign,” it further claimed.",2025-09-16,Tahir Naseer,1975,0.000208

Muslims around the world celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), known in Arabic as the Mawlid al-Nabawi holiday, on the 12th of Rabiul Awwal — the third month of the Islamic lunar calendar. The nation also
celebrated Defence Day
today with the two events coinciding on the same date.
State-run
Radio Pakistan
reported
that the day — a public holiday announced by the government — began with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and a 21-gun salute in all provincial capitals.
It added that special prayers were also offered after the Fajr prayer for the unity of the Muslim world and Pakistan’s progress and prosperity.
The people celebrated the day with religious fervour and devotion, as mosques, streets, and public spaces across the country were adorned with colourful lights, green flags and decorations.
Special prayers, Seerat conferences and processions were held to mark the birth anniversary of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) with citizens participating in large numbers to pay tribute.
Markets and neighbourhoods glowed with festive lighting, and vendors displayed stalls offering badges, banners, and flags to mark the occasion. Community events, including food distribution and gatherings, were also organised nationwide.
The federal and provincial governments had made special arrangements to ensure peaceful and smooth observance of the occasion, with security and facilitation measures in place for devotees.
Religious leaders, scholars and government representatives at the 50th International Seerat-un-Nabi Conference also emphasised the need for responsible use of social media in line with Islamic teachings, while reaffirming Pakistan’s solidarity with the people of Palestine and occupied Kashmir.
The conference, organised by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony at the Convention Centre, was held under the theme ‘State’s Responsibilities in Educating for the Beneficial Use of Social Media in the Light of Holy Prophet’s Life (Peace Be Upon Him)’.
PM Shehbaz vows to rebuild Pakistan on principles of Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) life
In his message for the day, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called upon the nation to renew its commitment to build Pakistan in line with the teachings of the life of the Holy Prophet, emphasising unity, justice, compassion and peace.
He noted that this year, Pakistan and Muslims around the world were celebrating the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) 1,500th birth anniversary.
“This historic milestone is being observed in accordance with the resolutions passed by both the National Assembly and the Senate, reflecting a collective national resolve to make the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) teachings an integral part of the country’s Constitution, legal framework and public life,” he added.
“The life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) is a complete and comprehensive model for all aspects of life governance, justice, economics, trade, and social values,“ the prime minister said.
He stressed that the youth must be taught to embrace the eternal values of morality, kindness and truth as taught by the Holy Prophet and become ambassadors of his message of love, peace, and brotherhood.
PM Shehbaz underscored that the real strength of Pakistan lay in unity, tolerance and inclusivity.
“To overcome the challenges facing our nation, be they economic or social, we must integrate the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) teachings into our national character,” he asserted.
PM Shehbaz also called for rejecting all forms of prejudice, sectarianism, extremism and hatred, and instead promoting empathy, solidarity, and harmony among all citizens.
The premier urged every Pakistani to reaffirm their pledge to establish Pakistan as a true Islamic welfare state based on the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) model of compassion, social justice and equality.
He said the government’s core priorities include eradicating poverty, promoting education and research, and ensuring equal opportunity for all.
Similarly, President Asif Ali Zardari greeted the entire nation and Muslim world on the day of 1212 Rabiul Awwal and urged the people to pledge to mould individual and collective lives in accordance with the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) teachings.
“This historic and memorable occasion is a source of joy and devotion for the Muslim ummah,” he said adding, “Besides this 12 Rabiul Awwal, the joy of completing the 1,500th anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) brings us the message that we should implement the Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) universal principles of justice, mercy, brotherhood and peace in our social, political and cultural structures.“
He added that the day “unites Muslims all over the world in a relationship that is based on faith and whose focus is solely and exclusively the noble personality” of the Holy Prophet (PBUH).
President Zardari said the life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) taught that justice, fairness, compassion, kindness, brotherhood, equality and respect for humanity were the foundations of a pious society.
“Today, when the world is faced with challenges such as extremism, injustice, social unrest, and uncontrolled trends of digitalisation, we need to find solutions to these problems in the light of the life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH),” he stressed.
“The solutions to the challenges that the Muslim ummah and Pakistan are facing today lie in the teachings of the Holy Prophet (PBUH). He taught us unity, love, and brotherhood, and these are the principles that can take us out of social and economic problems. Let us take this opportunity to pledge that we will put our differences behind us and work together for the development of our country and nation.
“The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) always taught us to help the weak, orphans, and the needy,” he continued, adding, “It is our responsibility to adopt the examples set by the Holy Prophet (PBUH).“
Addressing the current issues arising from the effects of climate change, he said joint efforts were being made by the government, local administration and relief organisations to ensure the safety and rehabilitation of the affected as early as possible.
“This is the time when we, while learning from Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), should help our people with open hearts and ensure their rehabilitation as soon as possible, because Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) also strived for the welfare of others in every situation,” he added.",2025-09-06,APP,1631,0.000182

The notices stated that the decision to terminate memberships was effective immediately and in line with the PTI’s policy and procedures.
“The reason for your termination is your actions in the GB Assembly, especially making a forward block and voting against the party decision, which is a clear violation of our party’s policy. Your actions have caused harm to the party’s interests and reputation,” the notices read.
The lawmakers were also asked not to use the party’s “name, designation and/or membership in any manner or whatsoever, failing which the party reserves to take action against you which may also lead to legal action”.
Moreover, the PTI also issued a show-cause notice to former GB governor Raja Jalal Hussain Maqpoon.
The show cause notice, also dated September 5 and available with

“In view of these reported activities, you are hereby called to explain yourself in writing within two days of this notice. If your reply is unsatisfactory or you do not respond, further action will be taken as per party policy and rules,” it added.
Gulbar Khan’s election as CM
Gulbar Khan — a disgruntled member of the PTI — had
replaced
party’s Khalid Khurshid as the GB chief minister in July 2023, after the latter was
disqualified
by the GB Chief Court for obtaining a licence from the GB Bar Council allegedly based on a fake education degree.
His disqualification had led several PTI lawmakers to switch sides, and ultimately, a coalition government, comprising PTI’s disgruntled members and PML-N and PPP lawmakers, was formed in the region, with Gulbar Khan as the CM.
Prior to that, a
Dawn
report
had cited sources as saying that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in consultation with the PPP, had nominated Gulbar for the coveted role.
Following Gulbar’s election, the PTI, through its Central Media Department, had issued a statement condemning the “robbery of public mandate in Gilgit-Baltistan in broad daylight”.
Later, the PTI had
issued show cause
notices to 11 of its members for voting in favour of Gulbar Khan.

According to the amendments to the Sindh Motor Vehicle Rules, notified on Tuesday, the commercial vehicles older than 20 years operating on inter-provincial routes won’t be issued road permits.
Talking to
Dawn
, Senior Sindh Minister Sharjeel Memon, who also holds the portfolio of transport department, said on Wednesday that the amendments aimed to protect lives and property, decrease accident rates, and enhance transparency in the traffic system.
He pointed out that old and poorly maintained heavy vehicles were a primary cause of
traffic accidents
in the province, including Karachi.
Sindh govt sets age limit for vehicles to improve road safety
“The new regulations mandate that heavy vehicles must have a valid fitness certificate and necessary safety devices to operate on roads,” he added.
He said that permits would not be issued for vehicles older than 20 years on inter-provincial routes. “Vehicles older than 25 years will not be allowed on inter-city routes, and the maximum age limit for vehicles operating within cities has been fixed at 35 years,” he added.
Mr Memon said that heavy commercial vehicles were now required to secure fitness certificates from the transport department-approved centres.
“Non-compliance will result in substantial penalties for vehicle owners, with all fines mandatorily paid online directly into the provincial government’s account,” he added.
The transport minister said that the law would be implemented within a one-year period, during which all vehicles must pass a roadworthiness test. “In the initial phase, minor infractions will incur petty fines, with escalating penalties for repeat offences — up to Rs200,000 for a second violation and Rs300,000 for a third,” he added.
The transport minister said that the provincial government had mandated all heavy and light commercial vehicles to install tracking and security systems. “Required features include GPS tracking, high-definition front and rear cameras, a driver monitoring camera, and a 360-degree camera system,” he added.
Mr Memon stated that underrun protection guards would be mandatory to prevent smaller vehicles and motorcycles from being crushed in accidents.
He said that the safety devices were required to be fully operational. “Vehicles won’t be registered, issued fitness certificates, granted permits, or allowed ownership transfer without verification that these systems are functioning properly,” he added.
The transport minister said that failure to install or deliberate damage to the required systems would result in substantial fines and temporary vehicle impounding. “If the issue isn’t resolved within 14 days, the vehicle’s registration will be permanently cancelled,” he added.
Mr Memon said that the amendments had been introduced to safeguard lives and property, reduce accidents, and make the traffic system more transparent through modern technology.
He said the installation of modern tracking and camera systems would not only support the enforcement of traffic laws but also help identify the causes of accidents and ensure transparent investigations. “Heavy fines will be imposed for any violations, and unsafe vehicles will not be allowed on the roads,” he made it clear.
The senior minister said that the provincial government had taken these tough decisions to protect lives and property, and they would be enforced without exception.
“Clear instructions have been issued to the traffic police, excise police, and transport authorities that no concessions are to be made in the implementation of these laws,” he added.
He said the adoption of this modern system would not only provide relief to citizens but also help develop the transport sector along modern lines.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944859/judicial-commission-of-pakistan-panel-debates-benchmarks-for-judges-performance,Judicial Commission of Pakistan panel debates benchmarks for judges’ performance - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: Members of a Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) subcommittee have forwarded several proposals to be considered while drafting
rules
for evaluating high court judges and setting criteria for their elevation.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail-led subcommittee met on Friday with Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) representative Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon, Senator Farooq H. Naek from the treasury benches and Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar from the opposition in attendance.
The JCP subcommittee decided to consolidate and circulate each suggestion among all members for discussion at the next meeting, scheduled for the coming week and postponed proceedings, with an understanding to thoroughly discuss draft suggestions on framing benchmarks to assess judicial performance of sitting judges of the high courts.
One of the proposals was to consider the time period within which a judgement is delivered after it has been reserved by a high court judge, since inordinate delays ultimately frustrate litigants.
Members put forward suggestions, to be consolidated for discussion next week
The committee also suggested making it obligatory for high court judges to pronounce judgements within three months, as held in 2015 Messrs MFMY Industries Ltd case by a three-judge Supreme Court bench.
Presided over by Justice Saqib Nisar, the apex court in its ruling had held that a reasonable time for the pronouncement of judgements should be 90 days, since the enunciation of law requires considerable research, reflection and deliberation.
Ninety days, it noted, should be adequate for composition of judgements. If judges are unable to deliver judgements within this time period, they must record sufficient reasons and may order the case to be reheard.
Number of cases
Another proposal under consideration was for the JCP to evaluate how many cases a judge decides in a month, and whether those decisions involve substantive matters that advance jurisprudence or merely routine bail matters.
The proposals also included assessing whether a judge exhausts the entire cause list for the day or merely hears a few cases and adjourns the rest.
However, questions remain about how benchmarks will account for cases withdrawn after judges point out jurisdictional flaws. A legal expert, noted that such withdrawals save judicial time by avoiding unnecessary appeals, yet they are never reported in law digests. “Should a judge be penalised for thoroughly understanding the case and prompting withdrawal?” the expert asked.
The expert further explained that performance cannot simply be measured by the number of cases heard in a day, as much depends on the type of cases assigned by the chief justice. For example, civil revision cases are time-consuming and complex, whereas other categories may involve issuing directions to departments and can be decided more quickly. Comparing judges across such different case types would be unfair, he argued.
On June 19, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi constituted the broad-based committee on judicial performance evaluation of high court judges. The committee, comprising members from the judiciary, parliament, executive, and legal fraternity, was tasked with preparing draft rules for annual judicial performance evaluations and developing criteria for the selection of judges.
The
26th Amendment
to Article 175A allows the JCP to give underperforming high court judges time to improve, and if they fail, recommend their removal to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
And after the completion of the period so granted, the performance of the judge is again found to be inefficient; the commission will send its report to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) with a recommendation to remove the judge.
Moreover, the commission will hold annual evaluations of high court judges and may set rules to define performance standards.

The sharpest blows came in the Right of Reply, with Indian representative Rentala Srinivas branding Pakistan a terrorist state, declaring: “No arguments or untruths can ever whitewash the crimes of Terroristan.”
Responding, Muhammad Rashid, Second Secretary at the Pakistan Mission, condemned the remarks as “utterly shameful,” saying India had stooped so low as to distort the name of a fellow UN member state.
Also refuting the terrorism claims made earlier by Indian External Affairs Minister Jaishankar and calling the distortion attempt “undignified”, Rashid went on to say that India itself “is not just a serial perpetrator of terrorism, but a regional bully that is holding South Asia hostage to its hegemonic designs and radical ideology.”

He called on the international community to pay attention to India’s “reckless behaviour.”
“By engaging in this kind of rhetoric, India diminishes its own credibility, showing the world that it has no substantive argument to offer—only, I am sorry to say, cheap slurs which are not worthy of serious discourse.”
Questioning the tone of the language, Rashid further said: “Such language reflects neither maturity nor responsibility. Instead, it exposes that India is frustrated and reveals its pettiness on the world stage.“
He claimed India “itself has been implicated in supporting and sponsoring terrorism beyond its borders.”
Calling it unfortunate, the Pakistani diplomat added that Indian “intelligence operatives have been accused of financing and directing groups engaged in sabotage and targeted killings across the world.”
“Undermining regional stability and violating international law is a habit for India.“
Rashid also noted that actions such as these “expose duplicity of India’s counterterrorism claims, and raise concern regarding India fuelling terrorism rather than combating it”.
He stressed that the claims made by Jaishankar were “completely devoid of facts” and an attempt to “malign” Pakistan’s name.
Earlier, the Indian minister had said that “India has confronted this challenge since independence, having a neighbour that is an epicentre of global terrorism,” without naming Pakistan.
Outlining Pakistan’s losses in the fight against terrorism, Rashid highlighted that Pakistan is “one of the strongest pillars in leading global efforts for combating terrorism.”
On the other hand, India, the diplomat pointed out, “is in the league of those who illegally occupy territories, oppress populations and violate fundamental human rights, as is the case in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
“State terrorism — in the form of: extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions, staged encounters and collective punishment under the cover of counter terrorism.”
While reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to peace in South Asia, Rashid noted that “these goals cannot be achieved through threats and intimidation.”
On that note, he invited India to “embrace” peace, stating, “True progress requires sincerity, mutual respect, dialogue and diplomacy — principles Pakistan has upheld, and which India must finally choose to embrace, if it truly seeks peace.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945402/justice-in-retreat,Justice in retreat - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE judiciary, once regarded as a source of clarity in times of political and institutional uncertainty, now appears increasingly consumed by internal discord.
Where judgements once prompted debates about their implications for citizens, the focus today has shifted to the courts’ own crises. Instead of guiding the public, the judiciary seems locked in a cycle of controversy that has steadily eroded all confidence in its ability to dispense justice.
Recent decisions have done little to inspire trust or repair their reputation. In most of the political cases, the courts have increasingly appeared unconcerned about grounding their rulings in sound reasoning, as long as the outcome serves immediate ends. At other times, they have adopted an inexplicable passivity when proactive intervention was both warranted and constitutionally mandated. This was true of both the case pertaining to the
military trial
of civilians, as well as the
petitions
concerning the
26th Amendment.
The judiciary is expected to uphold the supremacy of the law and ensure the separation of powers. Yet in case after case, this solemn responsibility seems to have been abdicated.
Worse still, judges who have sought to defend their institution appear to have paid a steep price. A troubling example is that of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri of the Islamabad High Court, who was among the judges to formally
complain
of interference by intelligence agencies in a letter addressed to the superior judiciary in 2024.
Recently, Karachi University once again
cancelled
his law degree, declaring it tainted by “unfair means” he allegedly used four decades ago. The timing of this extraordinary step, coming just days after the judge, along with four others,
petitioned
the Supreme Court regarding alleged misdoings in the IHC, raises grave questions about how internal resistance to the judiciary’s perceived capture is being dealt with by powerful quarters.
If a high court judge can be discredited and penalised in this manner, what hope can an ordinary petitioner have? If the courts themselves cannot safeguard their own, how can they protect the rights of citizens? These are questions the judiciary must confront with urgency.
Unless it can restore its independence and reassert its commitment to fairness, it risks losing not only public confidence but also its relevance as a guardian of justice. It is disturbing to contemplate what would happen in that instance.
If powerful individuals and institutions begin writing and rewriting the laws based on their whims, and if a handful of people start deciding where the law applies and where it does not, society will devolve to a Hobbesian state. The judiciary is meant to safeguard the vulnerable and check those with totalitarian instincts. It cannot and must not avoid that responsibility. Pakistan and its people must not be abandoned to a punishing fate.

“Agent Asadullah was detained along with the Afghan nationals during the operation against human smugglers,” the spokesman said, adding that key evidence was recovered from his mobile phone, including photos, messages and other records linking him to trafficking activities.
The spokesman claimed that Asadullah was in contact with other agents involved in smuggling Afghans abroad illegally. He said the interrogation of the detainees is underway, while raids are being conducted to arrest more suspects.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939078,Footprints: Good drainage makes good neighbours - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE poet Robert Frost believed that good fences make good neighbours. But for the residents of Kotli Loharan, a peri-urban community located on the outskirts of Sialkot, it is the lack of drainage — not fences — which has neighbours virtually at each other’s throats.
The town’s western side, through which the Khannay Wala Nullah flows, is slightly more elevated than the eastern side. The area has always been prone to flooding whenever the river overflows, but in the past, the water would find its course through the alleyways of the community in the form of rivulets and end up in the seasonal drain.
This time around, however, the
sheer amount
of water is staggering to behold, and it has not been able to find its natural path to drain into the nullah.
Make no mistake, both the eastern and western ends of Kotli Loharan are submerged; but while the water level to the east is around 6 feet, the west side is under half that depth.
Residents on one side want culverts dismantled so floodwater can drain into the nullah, a proposal that has faced stiff opposition from those that dwell near the seasonal drain
Over the past five to six days, residents of the eastern side have struggled to dismantle culverts in a bid to divert the water west, so it can flow into the Khannay Wala Nullah.
This plan has faced stiff resistance from those who dwell on the other side, who have blocked efforts by locals and the district administration to make any cuts that would add to their watery woes.
This post-flood situation has created internal rifts, differences and given birth to water politics in the area — which is already reeling from outbreaks of disease brought on by the deep, stagnant waters – and curtailing cooperation with the government to deal with such situations.
“We have been cut off from Sialkot since Aug 26, as floodwaters are still present in our area, inside our homes,” says Zafar Abbas Bukhari, a resident of the eastern side. “Many of our children and elderly people are ill and getting medicines from relief camps and other sources. But the issue is yet to be resolved,” he tells us.
Another youth, Inam, narrates how he would ride into town on a tractor trolley to buy groceries, and then make the perilous journey back, just so his family could eat.
Mr Bukhari says officials had brought excavators to break down the culverts to allow the water to drain out the other side. But people from western side of Kotli Loharan had the work forcefully halted, arguing that their homes would be submerged under yet more water if this were to happen.
According to Deputy Commissioner Saba Asghar Ali, the issue in Kotli Loharan stems from the subdivision of agricultural land and the development on residential zones on it.
It has become common practice; first, structures are built illegally, then residents start demanding the construction of roads, sewage and other infrastructure, she deplored.

Massive flows
On Aug 26, a flood of around 400,000 cusecs hit Head Marala — near Sialkot — during the night. The flow increased rapidly to 917,525 cusecs, causing widespread flooding.
Although relief camps were reportedly made operational, many residents did not hear the announcements and remained in bed, leading to 22 fatalities in Sialkot city and Sambrial tehsil.
The devastating collapse of the Hanji bridge at Nullah Dek only compounded the area’s problems.
Official data indicates that Sialkot tehsil was impacted by the overflowing of both nullahs, Dek and Palkhu, as they exceeded safe limits.
The damage so far include two collapse bridges, 46 culverts, 36 roads and 340,240 acres of cropland affected.
Unfortunately, Sialkot city and its suburbs still lack a modern drainage system, with domestic waste and storm water being pumped and disposed through the same sewage lines, laid decades ago.
The government also started a plan, implemented under the Punjab Intermediate Cities Improvement Investment Programme, with support from the Asian Development Bank some years ago, but it is yet to become operational due to various pending engineering issues, including the desilting of nullahs.

During a search operation under the ongoing “Zarb-e-Haider” operation in North Waziristan’s Dattakhel area, suspected militants attacked security forces near the villages of Kharkmar and Kharsin, resulting in the martyrdom of two security personnel, sources said.
The bodies of the personnel were airlifted to the regional headquarters in Miranshah, the sources said.
Following the attack, a heavy exchange of fire continued for several hours, with security forces using gunship helicopters to shell suspected militant hideouts.
Authorities gave residents of Kharkmar and Kharsin a two-hour ultimatum to evacuate, prompting an exodus of families.
Deputy Commissioner of North Waziristan Muhammad Yousuf Karim said 140 families, or about 1,500 people, had fled the area. He said accommodations were arranged in government schools, where they are being provided with food and medical aid. “We will try our best to complete this operation in two to three days so that people can return to their homes,” Mr Karim said.

• Opposition leader asks KE to withdraw MUCT increase in electricity bills
• Mayor claims City Council approved hike in its budget session
KARACHI: In a move drawing sharp criticism from the opposition for allegedly violating “defined legal limits”, the Karachi Metropolitan Corpor­ation (KMC) has increased the rates of the Municipal Utility Charges and Taxes (MUCT) for industrial and commercial users from Rs400 to Rs750.
Members of the business community complained that they were being charged nearly double the previous amount in the head of the MUCT.
The MUCT are collected via K-Electric bills from its consumers living within the jurisdiction of the KMC.
Leader of the Opposition in the City Council Advocate Saifuddin of the Jamaat-i-Islami has sent a legal notice to KE Chief Executive Officer Moonis Alvi, demanding that the power utility immediately withdraw the increase in the MUCT, which was made “unlawfully” without the approval of the elected City Council.
The notice highlighted that the KE raised MUCT rates to Rs750 per month for commercial properties, despite the last City Council resolution, which fixed the rate at Rs400 per month in June 2024. A subsequent proposal to increase the rate to Rs550 was deferred in 2025, and no new resolution has been passed since then, read the notice.
“The KE, which only acts as a collection agent on behalf of the KMC, has no legal authority to alter or enhance MUCT rates,” said Mr Saifuddin.
He said the arbitrary hike not only burdened citizens of Karachi, but also undermined the authority of the elected City Council and insulted the public mandate.
City Mayor Murtaza Wahab, however, expressed his “wonders” over “unawareness” of the opposition and its leaders about the “facts and procedures”.
“This increase has in fact been approved by the City Council in the budget session,” he told
Dawn
.“So this argument doesn’t stand that it’s a violation of the rules.”
He continued: “Secondly we only increased slab for the industrial and commercial users. The reason is this segment of the city is more prone to fire and other incidents where the municipal resources and utilities are spent more. We should not mislead people only for political point scoring.”
‘No new charges’
KMC officials claimed that no new charges were being imposed under the MUCT head.
“Historically, industrial and commercial consumers were charged up to Rs5,000 under the same category,” said an official.
The slab for industrial and commercial consumers had initially been reduced to Rs400 by the mayor, but it was being revised upward in the latest budget, he added.
“The funds collected through this municipal tax will be utilised for essential services, including the fire brigade and road maintenance,” added the official.
The KMC in August 2024 formally notified the collection of MUCT through K-Electric.
The KMC and the KE had signed an agreement in June 2022 which finally became effective from July 2024 after the City Council approved the levy.
The consumers are charged as per category, which is notified by the KMC from time to time.
Referring to different slabs of the MUCT, an official said that the KE consumers receiving bills of up to 100 units remain exempted from the taxes and those consuming units between 101 and 200 pay Rs20 every month.
Those consuming units between 201 and 300 pay Rs40 and those consuming between 301 and 400 units pay Rs100 through their KE bills.
The KE consumers consuming 401-500 units pay Rs125, the consumers of units between 501 and 600 pay Rs150, the consumers of 601 and 700 units pay Rs175 and those consuming more than 700 units pay Rs300 in their monthly bills.
All categories of commercial and industrial consumers pay Rs400 each with their electricity bills.

An official told
Dawn
that the higher education department had identified 39 disciplines, taught in 35 government colleges across the province, for discontinuation, while the rest of the subjects would remain unaffected.
“The courses with five or six enrolled students will be closed down,” he said.
The official said it was actually tantamount to the “misuse of government resources” to continue with programmes with low enrolments, while the students were reluctant to take admissions in such subjects as they didn’t have any “value” in the job market.
Official says ‘market-oriented’ subjects to be introduced
He rejected media reports about the plans to discontinue the Bachelor of Studies (BS) programme in government colleges.
The official, however, said that the department had closed down BS (Pashto) programme at Abbottabad’s Government Postgraduate College No 1, BS (Political Science) at Abbottabad’s Government Postgraduate College for Women and BS (Islmiat) at Abbottabad’s Qalandabad Government Postgraduate College.
He said the same was the case with other districts.
“After the closure of such programmes, we’ll introduce market-oriented subjects in government colleges,” he said.
The HED has also decided to introduce an associate degree programme in a couple of disciplines, replacing the BS degree programme in 128 colleges of the province.
The official told
Dawn
that an associate degree programme has been introduced in those disciplines where enrolment had decreased with the passage of time. Under the associate degree programme, the students can continue their education by taking admission in the fifth semester of the BS programme.
“In fact the course of the BS programme has been split and named as an associate degree programme,” he said.
The official said the associate degree programme was equal to the BA/BSc degrees and the holders of associate degree programmes could get jobs with it.
He said that the associate degree programme was already functioning in the government colleges located in the rural and far off areas of the province.
One of the professors of a government degree college criticised HED for taking “ill-planned” decisions regarding new subjects and degree programmes.
“The department extended the BS programme to all government colleges without ensuring required faculty and facilities,” he said.
A notification read that the directorate of HED had undertaken a comprehensive review of the Bachelor of Science (BS) and Associate Degree (AD) programmes currently offered in the government colleges to assess existing resources and align future academic offerings with strategic needs.
It added that the review identified several critical challenges, including high dropout rates and low student enrollment in certain BS programmes.
According to the notification, it has been observed that a significant number of BS disciplines, often with limited market relevance, are consuming a disproportionate share of resources. This has constrained the department’s ability to introduce new, market-aligned programmes that better serve the students’ interests.
“To optimise resource utilisation and create a more conducive and relevant academic environment, a dedicated BS Committee was constituted by the department. The committee has thoroughly reviewed the existing BS programme currently offerings, with a specific focus on creating space for market aligned disciplines.Based on the committee’s recommendations, which have been duly approved by the competent authority, it had been decided to close the selected BS programmes with immediate effect,” read the notification.
It added that selected colleges would fully or partially transition from BS programmes to Associate Degree programmes.
The notification said those colleges would initiate subject-based Associate Degree programmes after formal permission from the department.
“This strategic shift is designed to strengthen the academic foundation of our colleges and ensure the efficient and effective use of departmental resources, hence, shall be implemented in true spirit,” it said.
The notification added that BS colleges were allowed to initiate BS admissions through online portal specifically in the approved subjects.

rise
in water level at Harike and Ferozpur which will affect nine districts of Punjab, including Kasur.
This news has dashed the hopes of thousands of displaced families who had just begun to see the floodwaters recede over the past 48 hours.
The water level at Ganda Singh Headworks had dropped by nearly 100,000 cusecs in a single day, bringing the reading down to 182,188 cusecs. Although this still qualifies as an extremely high flood level, the decrease in water and monsoon rains had allowed some roads in six villages near the headworks to become passable again. However, the district administration has not yet allowed residents to return home.
During a press conference, Deputy Commissioner Imran Ali confirmed that rescue teams remain on high alert. He said the administration is continuing to evacuate people and is working to distribute food and fodder to affected communities. The DC also lamented that non-flood victims from nearby villages have been taking relief bags and other items meant for those most in need.

He said the weeks-long flooding has caused a massive loss of crops, property, and livestock. He assured that teams would be formed to assess the damage once the river returns to a normal level.
Meanwhile, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan visited the DC office on Wednesday and reviewed the arrangements. He asked the administration to leave no stone unturned in mitigating the sufferings of the flood victims. He also assured that the affected people were on top priority of the government and it was standing shoulder to shoulder with the flood-tossed, including farmers.
NAROWAL: A temporary bridge built on the river Tavi has collapsed due to passage of heavy traffic, cutting off the land connection between 85 villages in the Bajwat sector with Sialkot.
The original bridge on the River Tavi was swept away around a fortnight ago after release of floodwater by India and due to heavy rains in the occupied Kashmir.
On the instructions of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, the Sialkot district administration had constructed a temporary bridge on the River Tavi a week ago for the convenience of the residents of the 85 villages in Bajwat sector.
However, the temporary bridge collapsed on Wednesday morning when a tractor-trolley, loaded with 6,000 bricks, was crossing it.
Due to the bridge collapse, the traffic movement between these 85 villages and Sialkot has been suspended and the area has once again lost the land connection with Sialkot.
Two locals, Naeem and Arif Hussain, say that the temporary bridge built just a week ago was the only land connection between the 85 villages, including Bajwat, with Sialkot.
They deplore that the collapse of the temporary bridge has suspended the movement of thousands of people living in these villages, including government employees, traders and workers employed in different factories in Sialkot, who are facing difficulties in reaching their respective workplaces.
Sialkot Deputy Commissioner Saba Asghar Ali told
Dawn
that the temporary bridge collapsed due to heavy traffic and it would be repaired and restored by Thursday (today).
The locals have demanded that the chief minister should take immediate notice of the situation and ensure reconstruction of the Tavi bridge as soon as possible to resume the transportation of the residents of the 85 villages to Sialkot.

The decision came in a verdict by IHC’s Justice Babar Sattar in a case pertaining to the appointment of the PTA’s member (administration) filed by digital rights activist Usama Khilji in 2023.
Rehman later filed an urgent intra-court appeal against the verdict.
The order said the court had admitted the petition for hearing and directed the government not to proceed with the hiring, following which the government had filed an appeal for a stay of the court injunction, which was partially accepted, as the court had subsequently allowed the recruitment process to continue while warning that any appointment would be subject to the final determination in the case.
It added that the court was subsequently informed in later hearings that Hafeezur Rehman, a retired major general, was
appointed
as the member (administration) and then the PTA chairman.
In his verdict, Justice Sattar remarked: “The entire process of creation of the post of member (administration), prescription of qualifications and criteria for such post and the manner in which the recruitment process was carried out lacked integrity and suffered from mala fide in law. The recommendation by the selection committee of a panel of three individuals for the appointment to the post of nember (administration) was not in conformance with the requirements of Rule 4(4) of the PTA Appointment Rules, which required that only one candidate could be recommended.
“The decision of the federal government to pick the candidate listed at the bottom of panel recommended by the selection committee on the basis of merit was devoid of any reasoning or objective basis and fell afoul the obligation of the federal government under Section 24A of the General Clauses Act, 1897, to act in a just, fair and reasonable manner.”
The verdict further read: “Similarly, the appointment of respondent No.4 as chairman PTA, after being appointed as member (administration), without any objective or transparent process and without the federal government recording any reasons as to why he was so selected from amongst the members of PTA, was illegal, irrational and unsustainable in the eyes of law.”
He said the petition was allowed on the above grounds and remarked that the subsequent steps taken by the federal government in filling the post of member (administration) were not sustainable in the eyes of the law and were of no legal effect.
“The entire edifice of processes and decisions built on an illegal foundation must crumble upon such illegal foundation. As the impugned advertisement and the process of recruitment undertaken thereunder suffered from malice in law, all subsequent decisions in pursuit of such process, including the appointment of respondent No.4 as member (administration) and chairman PTA, are illegal, ultra vires the law and of no legal effect.”
Concluding his verdict, the judge said that since the entire process of Rehman’s appointment as the member (administration) and as the PTA chairman was found to “suffer from malice in law being the product of an unconstitutional and illegal recruitment process, he shall cease to hold such appointments and shall immediately relinquish charge for such offices”.
The judge ordered that the senior-most serving PTA member would temporarily assume the charge of the office of PTA chairman till the time that the federal government appointed a regular chairman.",2025-09-16,Tahir Naseer,896,0.000127
https://www.dawn.com/news/1941539/pakistan-gets-its-first-ai-driving-test-car-in-punjab,Pakistan gets its first AI driving test car in Punjab - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s first artificial intelligence-based driving test car has been launched, marking a major milestone in modernising the licensing system.
DIG Traffic Waqas Nazir has introduced the innovative vehicle, explaining that it is equipped with advanced cameras, sensors and biometric systems to ensure transparency and efficiency in the driving test process. The car features an internal facial recognition camera, four external cameras and a biometric machine for fingerprint verification.
Upon entering the vehicle, candidates will receive automated instructions related to the test.
The system also includes a countdown timer, handbrake and seatbelt configuration checks, and an AI-enabled feature that automatically fails candidates if reverse gear is used more than once.
Test results will be uploaded instantly through an automated system, reducing chances of human error or bias.
Initially, the AI-based car will be deployed in Lahore, with plans to expand it across other cities of Punjab. Notably, this breakthrough innovation has been developed by the Traffic Police on a self-help basis, without external funding.
Under the new update, cameras at every driving test centre will stay live 24/7 and no one will walk away with a licence unless the entire test is caught on video.
In previous years, driving test footage used to be deleted after just 15 days but it will now be saved forever and directly linked to the Punjab Safe Cities Authority’s high-security database.
“This step will slam the door on fraud and guarantee that only skilled drivers hit the roads,” officials said.
Test vehicles will be armed with smart cameras and sensors that automatically track every wrong turn, missed signal, and sloppy move, exposing unfit drivers instantly.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944840/why-did-hpv-vaccination-drive-fail-in-bahawalpur-region,Why did HPV vaccination drive fail in Bahawalpur region? - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"BAHAWALNAGAR: The Bahawalpur region, including districts of Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar and Rahim Yar Khan, has been unable to achieve even half of the targets set for the 13-day campaign for the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which officially ends on Saturday (today).
According to data given in a report of Special Branch, a copy available with
Dawn
, during the campaign from Sept 15 to Sept 27 in the region, the total target was 935,390, of which only 452,094 girls had been vaccinated so far, accounting for only 48pc of the target. However, it added that no district in Punjab could achieve its goal.
The vaccination targets for girl students in the three districts of Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar and Rahim Yar Khan were 299,043, 248,600 and 387,747, respectively. However, Bahawalpur achieved 52pc (156,586), Rahim Yar Khan 49pc (189,078) and Bahawalnagar achieved only 43pc (106,430) of its targets.
Propaganda and written consent
Intelligence sources told
Dawn
that the drive, which began on Sept 15 across Punjab, slowed down soon after its launch due to negative and misleading social media propaganda. Furthermore, the failure of the administration to debunk the false information available online despite intelligence agencies’ warning against it was also a contributing factor.
While requesting anonymity, some senior health and education officials said that prior to the campaign, the regional health administration was in contact with the education officials and parents were constantly informed about the benefits of this vaccination. They said that a large number of parents expressed their willingness to vaccinate their daughters before the drive was launched. However, the situation changed drastically a day before the vaccination drive started when the education department issued a letter.
Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Rahim Yar Khan dists miss the targets by half
The letter required written consent of the parents and this became the primary reason for the drive’s failure, the health and education officials said. They added that the move created many ambiguities in people’s minds about vaccination, which were further fueled by negative social media propaganda by the uneducated or semi-educated social media users and influencers from conservative sections of society.
The Special Branch report, issued on Sept 26, also said the letter issued by the education department on Sept 14, a day before the drive, had caused severe anxiety among the parents and citizens. It went on to say that parents became averse to the HPV vaccine due to the lack of awareness sessions before the start of the campaign and the letter from the education department.
School admin’s lack of interest
The officials gave another reason for the HPV vaccination campaign’s failure that was the school administrations’ lack of interest in the drive, which led to the teachers not only failing to properly brief the students and their parents about the benefits of this HPV vaccine, but in some cases, misleading the parents about the vaccine.
Endorsing the officials’ views, Bahawalnagar CEO Health Dr Shaukat Ali told
Dawn
that during the aforementioned drive, schoolteachers demonstrated the lack of interest in vaccinating girl students He claimed that instead of guiding and motivating the parents and students and obtaining written permission, the teachers informed the health department in writing that the students and their parents were not interested in getting vaccinated. He stated that, while the health department continued to hold several awareness seminars, walks and other activities about the benefits of vaccination during the aforementioned drive, social media campaigns and a lack of cooperation from private and education officials prevented the health department from reaching even half of its target in the district Bahawalnagar.
Lack of security
Judging by people’s sentiments regarding vaccination, the Special Branch and other intelligence agencies had alerted the administration through their reports that vaccination teams should be sent along with police or social mobilisers to deal with any untoward situation. However, no security was provided to the health teams across the region, including Bahawalnagar, due to which vaccination teams had to face violence at several places.
The Special Branch report said that on Sept 18 and Sept 25, at two different locations in Bahawalnagar, the health teams that were not accompanied by any security were attacked by the parents and the people at the private school at Multani Chowk and at Govt Girls Elementary School, Hussain Colony, Chishtian. The report again suggested that the administration should send the health teams under strict protection and follow security protocols.
Regarding obtaining the remaining vaccination target, a senior DHA health official told
Dawn
that while the health department had not yet issued written instructions in this aspect; however, according to verbal instructions issued by the department, the vaccine should be delivered to various health centres at the district level, and girls, whose parents give permission, should be vaccinated there.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942252/protesting-kashmiri-refugees-press-for-implementation-of-demands,Protesting Kashmiri refugees press for implementation of demands - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"MUZAFFARABAD: Hundreds of men, women and children from families of post-1989 refugees from Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir staged a protest demonstration here on Monday, pressing the authorities to implement their charter of demands, including an increase in monthly subsistence allowance and a comprehensive resettlement package.
The protesters demanded that the AJK government present a clear roadmap by Oct 15 to resolve all their issues, including resettlement.
They called on the authorities to immediately increase the subsistence allowance of refugees by Rs1,500 per person in line with promises.
They also sought a comprehensive financial package based on land, housing and employment, restoration of the six percent quota in government jobs, and full implementation of all commitments.
“The time has come to heal the wounds of the Kashmir refugees,” the speakers stressed, vowing that the Refugee Working Committee (RWC) would not abandon its oppressed brethren to fate.
The protest, organized by the RWC—a body formed in March 2024 to champion the cause of post-1989 refugees—began with a sit-in at the bustling Burhan Wani Chowk outside Press Club and culminated in a rally through the main thoroughfare to Ghari Pan Chowk.
Speakers at the gathering accused the AJK government of apathy and failure in addressing the decades-old issues of the community.
RWC chairman Uzair Ahmed Ghazali lamented that even after 36 years, post-1989 migrants remained deprived of their fundamental human, social and political rights.
“In their own country and state, the refugees remain landless and homeless, which is proof of the government’s failure,” he said.
Other RWC leaders, including Gohar Ahmed Kashmiri (general secretary), Raja Mohammad Arif (spokesperson), Irshad Ahmed Butt (chief coordinator), Riaz Ahmed Jaral, Mahmood Akhtar Qureshi, Mohammad Latif Lone (vice chairmen from Mirpur, Kotli and Bagh, respectively), Muhammad Iqbal Mir (secretary information), and Manzoor Iqbal Butt (treasurer), echoed similar views.
They demanded issuance of domiciles to grant full civic rights and allocation of separate seats in the Legislative Assembly for the post-1989 migrants from Jammu and Valley.
The RWC has held several meetings with the country’s top leadership over the past year, including President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Parliamentary Kashmir Committee chairman Mohammad Qasim Noon, and Parliamentary Committee on post-1989 Kashmiri refugees convenor Riaz Fatyana, to press its demands.
On September 9, an RWC delegation also met AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq at Kashmir House Islamabad, who had sought two days’ grace to renew his request to the federal government for funds to raise the allowance.
According to AJK Rehabilitation Department officials, each refugee is entitled to a monthly subsistence allowance of Rs3,500, which is drawn even by those running businesses or in jobs, though it ceases for individuals entering government service. Family members of such individuals, however, continue to receive the stipend.
Currently, around 46,000 people—up from an initial 10,000–12,000—constitute the post-1989 refugee community, spread across 8,601 families. Of them, 5,500 families reside in 25 camps (18 in Muzaffarabad, five in Bagh and two in Kotli), while the rest live in rented houses in different parts of AJK and Pakistan.
Speakers at Monday’s rally warned that despair was deepening among educated refugee youth due to lack of opportunities.
They stressed that the “base camp” government must shoulder its constitutional and historical responsibilities and evolve a clear strategy regarding the Kashmir freedom movement.
Expressing regret that those who had sacrificed for the liberation struggle had been awaiting their rights for nearly four decades, they urged the governments of AJK and Pakistan to take immediate and concrete measures to resolve their longstanding issues and enable them to live dignified and peaceful lives.

exceptionally high flood levels
in the Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab rivers have inundated hundreds of villages, forcing thousands of families to flee their homes with minimal assistance from the state.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has predicted the flood situation in the rivers but affected communities complain that the response on the ground is too little, too late that has left a trail of devastation in their fields.
The government had evacuated 529,938 people from Multan division, including 351,230 from district Multan, 102,645 from Khanewal, 56,763 from Vehari and 19,300 from Lodhran.
The District Muzaffargarh administration evacuated 68,043 people from its three tehsils, including Muzaffargarh, Alipur and Jatoi.
The government has established 25 flood relief camps in different areas of Multan, including Lakwala, Muhammadpur Mahota on Head Muhammadwala, Sher Shah, Bund Bosan and Sikandri Nala.
A flood relief camp has been established at Head Muhammadwala where over 250 families are residing.
The flood-affected persons said they were living in the open for the last two days and did not receive any help from the government. They said they were forced to leave their houses without picking their belongings, which could be destroyed in water or get stolen.
Replying to a query about the commissioner and district administration’s claims to have served the food and fodder for cattle, the people said they received rice two times in the last two days and no one provided them with fodder for their animals. They complained about the absence of clean water to drink, medical help and washroom facility, saying that children and women were facing problems due to non-availability of washrooms.
Flood-affected people living at a BHU said there were two washrooms for more than 2,000 people and that they were receiving only one-time meal while their children were contracting diseases due to contaminated water.
In tehsil Shujaabad and Jalalpur, people living in low-lying areas complained about the police and district administration for issuing them threats of dire consequences for not leaving their homes. They said that there was no electricity in the flood relief centres and there were a lot of mosquitoes.
Sajjad from Shujaabad said that assistant commissioner office employees and police officials ordered him to leave the house but he refused.
“The officials asked me to leave the house or they would set it on fire. I had to leave my belongings and now I am living without a roof, food and washrooms under the sky.” He said there were several families living in the camp and some were provided with cloth tents and it did not stop rainwater.
Multan Commissioner Amir Kareem Khan visited flood-prone areas, including Basti Muhammadpur Ghota, Jhok Venus, Sher Shah, Lukwala Bund, Hajipur and Basti Langrial, to review ongoing relief operations. The number of flood relief camps across the division was increased to 90.
In Burewala, Sahoka and surrounding settlements were submerged after a breach in the Sahoka-Chishtian Road which resulted in disconnecting hundreds of villages from the city.
“Our village is now an island,” explained Ayesha Bibi from Sahoka.
“The main road is under water. We are using makeshift boats to get to safety but where do we go? We have heard about relief camps but we have not seen any.”
In Manchanabad, temporary protective embankments at Mauza Rateeka, Lala Amar Singh, and several other villages were washed away, submerging thousands of acres of agricultural land and rice, cotton and maize crops. The floodwaters also cut off road access to multiple settlements.
In the Arifwala area, Basti Saboka, Yasin Kay, Balara Dilawar, and Balara Arjan were submerged. Several villages have lost road connectivity due to broken roads.
In Vehari, rescue teams relocated people and their livestock from the affected villages, including Lakhha Saldira, Sahooka, Farooqabad, Jamlera.
More than 80 villages were submerged and rural link roads eroded after high flood in the Ravi River at Kamalia. Officials said over 60,000 people were evacuated and 890 of them were given first aid. Their 61,999 animals were also evacuated. The road leading to Chichawatni, Faisalabad and M-3 interchange was submerged with floodwater near Kalaira Adda at Kamalia.

Addressing a conference on strong communities and combating extremism through poverty reduction programmes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa held here on Friday, he said a prosperous and peaceful future was directly linked to economic and social development.
Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) in collaboration with the KP Centre of Excellence on Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) and Paigham-i-Pakistan organised the conference at the Governor’s House.
Mr Kundi said unemployment, poverty and lack of opportunities bred despair and exploitation.
“Empowering communities economically and socially would serve as the strongest shield against extremism,” he stressed.
MNA and Prime Minister’s Youth Programme’s focal person Syeda Aamna Batool, KP Assembly members, secretary National Commission on Status of Women (NCSW) Humera Zia Mufti, PPAF chief executive officer Nadir Gul Bareech, KP Red Crescent Society chairman Farzand Ali Wazir, representatives of civil society organisations and a large number of women attended the function.
Governor Kundi visited stalls showcasing the province’s culture, distributed certificates among youth, and handed out interest-free loan cheques to skilled women. He also inaugurated two PPAF projects, an infrastructure scheme and an olive project.
In his remarks, the governor highlighted that positive image of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should be further promoted through a system based on equality and justice.
He emphasised narrowing the gap between the federation and provinces, ensuring fair distribution of resources, and extending development benefits to every corner of KP as key government priorities.
Appreciating PPAF’s efforts, Governor Kundi said the organisation had made it its mission to serve the most vulnerable segments of society.
“Projecting the province’s soft image is our priority, and together we must work for a developed and prosperous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said.
At the end of the event, the governor presented shields to MNA Aamna Batool, Humera Zia, and PPAF CEO Nadir Gul.

flood relief
under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP)  for flood-affected people and the other demanding tehsil status for Aghberg, a suburban area of provincial capital.
The assembly session also witnessed heated debates on governance, health, and development issues, before being adjourned until Sept 23 due to a lack of quorum.
The session began with question hour, where Opposition Leader Mir Younus Aziz Zehri protested against the rising costs of dam construction projects in the province.
He claimed that cost escalations were straining the provincial budget and delaying vital infrastructure. Following his protest, the matter was referred to the relevant committee for further review.
Zmarak Khan Achakzai of the Awami National Party (ANP) protested that the House was not proceeding according to its agenda, warning he would stage a walkout if official business was not taken seriously. He lamented the disorderly conduct of the assembly session, urging members to wait for their turn to speak.
Later, PML-N lawmaker Nawabzada Zareen Magsi moved a motion for permission to present a joint resolution, which was granted.
Presenting the resolution, Engineer Zmarak Khan Achakzai welcomed the federal government’s decision to
impose
a climate and agricultural emergency.
He demanded that flood victims in Balochistan should also be provided relief through the BISP.
Mr Achakzai highlighted that while Punjab and Sindh had already been hit by floods, Balochistan’s economy also depended on agriculture and faced similar
risks
. He called on the government to seek support from international organisations to ensure aid reached the province. Other lawmakers complained that while aid was announced for Balochistan, it often did not reach affected communities.
Supporting the resolution, Provincial Minister Mir Zahoor Buledi said floods had wreaked havoc in the country, adding that the full impact of the floods would emerge in the coming months. The resolution was unanimously adopted.
The House also approved the amended draft law for the Balochistan Institute of Nephro-Urology, following the committee report presented by Dr Nawaz Kibzai.
Another significant resolution came from ANP’s Malik Naeem Bazai, who called for granting tehsil status to Aghberg, located 35 km from Quetta and home to around 60,000 people.
Minister Mir Asim Kurd Gello raised no objection to Aghberg’s proposal, but said it must be reviewed by the Board of Revenue to confirm whether all requirements were fulfilled. The Assembly later passed the resolution.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940647/flood-devastation-prompts-food-inflation-fears,Flood devastation prompts food inflation fears - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: Floods in Punjab, which have submerged more than 1.3 million acres of farmland along the eastern rivers, have caused
significant damage
to the Kharif crops, particularly cotton,
prompting
fears of food inflation.
Floods have displaced two million people, submerged 2,000 villages, and led to the relocation of 760,000 residents and 516,000 heads of cattle from the affected areas.
The satellite imagery of 24 Punjab districts in the command areas of the Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab rivers shows that arou­nd 3,661 square kilometres, or 4.7 per cent of the total area, remained under floodwaters.
The floods have devastated key crops, including rice, sugarcane, corn, vegetables, and cotton. According to the Pakistan Business Forum, approximately 35pc of the cotton crop in central and southern Punjab has been destroyed, with losses reaching as high as 40-50pc in Bahawalnagar, the province’s largest cotton-producing district.
Kissan Board leader claims losses to tune of Rs500bn; over 1.3m acres of farmland submerged
Akhtar Farooq Meo of the Kissan Board Pakistan claimed that farmers sustained losses to the tune of Rs536 billion due to damage to the cotton, rice, sesame, maize, and fodder crops. Mr Meo claimed that many towns were facing shortages of perishable items and the situation could transform into a food crisis.
Meanwhile, there were conflicting reports about damage to the rice crop. The Pakistan Business Forum claimed that 60pc of the rice crop in central and southern Punjab had been destroyed — a claim contested by the exporters.
They said the Basmati crop region, with the exception of Pasrur in Sialkot, remained largely undamaged, adding that the non-Basmati crop, particularly along the Sutlej River, had already been harvested in late July and early August, with only hybrid varieties in some areas sustaining damage.
However, floods created a severe shortage of fodder, threatening the livestock industry, which was a major contributor to the national GDP.
Meanwhile, experts feared a sharp rise in domestic grain prices that could make Pakistani rice uncompetitive on the global market. Similarly, the loss of the cotton crop was also alarming for the textile industry, accounting for over half of Pakistan’s export revenues.
Ihsanul Haq, the chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, said the crop was under severe stress.
Major cotton-producing regions in Punjab and Sindh, including Bahawalnagar, Multan, Bahawalpur, and Rahim Yar Khan, were either currently submerged or were bracing for more heavy rainfall. The reduced supply of raw cotton reportedly forced several ginning factories and mills to cease operations. Furthermore, there were early reports of a virus affecting various cotton varieties, which could further reduce per-acre yields.

meeting
, raising serious concern among the relevant authorities.
According to the Punjab Additional Inspector General (AIG) of Police Investigation Branch, only 26 per cent of the in-charge investigators in Punjab, who conducted or oversaw investigations of blind murder cases of women, responded to the conference, held a week ago to discuss the status of unknown murder cases of women from 2010 to September 15, 2025.
The cases included unknown women’s bodies recovered from canals or other places, and proceedings under Section 173 CrPC regarding attempted suicides of women or FIRs registered in such cases.
In a reminder to all regional police officers (RPOs), city police officers (CPOs) and district police officers (DPOs), the AIG Investigation Punjab said in-charge investigators across Punjab, who carried out or supervised investigations of blind murder cases of women between 2019 and September 15, 2025, had been directed to bring along the progress reports of these cases.
However, only 64 out of 240 investigators attended the meeting, raising serious concerns among the authorities.
In his memo, the AIG investigation directed RPOs and CPOs to ensure that the remaining in-charge investigators are strictly instructed to attend his office with the required documents. He also said that police stations where no blind murder case was reported should submit a clearance certificate.
Earlier, the Punjab Police Monitoring Cell had sought a complete record of all cases of blind murders of women, unidentified women’s bodies discovered in canals or elsewhere, attempted suicides or suicides of women, and cases investigated under Section 174 CrPC that occurred across Punjab between 2019 and September 2025.
According to sources, the in-charge investigators of all Punjab police, including Rawalpindi, have been asked to appear before the Additional Inspector General Monitoring Punjab with the records of all registered cases.
The Additional IG Monitoring Punjab also issued a letter titled, “Appearance of In-charge Investigation” to the district police officers of all Punjab, including Lahore and Rawalpindi.
The letter said the competent authority had ordered all in-charge investigators to appear with complete records and details of blind murder cases of women or murders where the deceased women were unidentified, including incidents where women’s bodies were found in canals or other places.
Details were also sought about unidentified women’s bodies and cases involving attempted or committed suicides of women, or cases registered under Section 174 CrPC that remained under investigation.
In addition, all FIRs and related reports, along with the complete district records, were to be presented at the office of the Additional IG Monitoring Punjab in Lahore.
Police sources said the purpose of summoning the records and investigators was to review progress in such cases involving women and to formulate a strategy for investigating these untraced cases, including improving the overall investigation system.
According to law experts, Section 174 CrPC mandates police inquiries into unnatural deaths such as suicides or accidental deaths, to investigate and report the apparent cause of death.
The inquiry covers suicides, deaths by animals or machinery, accidental deaths, or deaths under circumstances that raise suspicion of an offence.
The Rawalpindi police have already submitted details of blind murder cases of women registered between 2019 and September 15, 2025.
Four such cases, registered with Saddar Beroni, Rawat and Jatli police stations, remain untraced.
Similarly, two cases of unidentified women’s bodies recovered from canals or other places were reported at Rawat Police Station, Rawalpindi, during this period. These cases also remain untraced.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945499/sindh-to-launch-govt-run-e-taxi-service-by-year-end,Sindh to launch govt-run e-taxi service by year-end - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: The Sindh government is fast-tracking efforts to launch Pakistan’s first government-run electric vehicle (EV) taxi service, with a formal rollout planned for December this year.
The “landmark initiative”, officials believe, will not only mark a major shift towards eco-friendly urban transport but also advance the province’s broader agenda of modernising public mobility.
The decision was made during a meeting on Monday, chaired by Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon. Senior officials including Secretary Transport Asad Zamin and Managing Director Sindh Mass Transit Authority Kanwal Nizam Bhutto were also present to provide updates on ongoing and upcoming transport projects.
A statement issued after the meeting said that Mr Memon, who also holds the portfolio of information and transport departments, announced that the Sindh government would become the “first” in Pakistan to launch a
state-run
taxi service, starting with a fleet of EV taxis.
Sharjeel says move marks shift towards eco-friendly urban transport
“This project is a personal priority for Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who wants to ensure the public has access to modern, safe and environmentally sustainable transport options,” the statement quoted the minister as saying.
Though the statement did not specify the city from which the EV taxi service will be launched, sources claim that Karachi has been selected as the starting point for its operation.
In the first phase, the statement noted, a portion of the EV taxi fleet will be designated exclusively for women, continuing the government’s focus on gender-sensitive transportation solutions.
The phase also includes the expansion of the “popular” Pink Bus Service, launched earlier to cater solely to female commuters, as well as the
Pink Scooty
scheme, which supports mobility for women and female students, the statement added.
The new EV taxi project is part of a broader transport transformation led by the Sindh government over the past few years. Among the most successful initiatives is the
Peoples Bus Service
, which has become a vital component of daily commuting in urban centres such as Karachi, Hyderabad and Larkana.
With a growing fleet of modern, air-conditioned buses and affordable fares, the Peoples Bus Service has improved accessibility and reliability in the province’s public transport system.
The government has also introduced eco-friendly EV buses and is planning to launch double-decker buses for high-traffic urban routes. These steps form part of Sindh’s commitment to reducing urban pollution while improving transportation infrastructure.
Mr Memon also said that work is under way to develop dedicated infrastructure such as EV
charging stations
to support the sustainability of electric public transport.

LAHORE: Deputy Prime Mini­s­ter Ishaq Dar is spearheading the launch of a new comprehensive str­ategy, the Pakistan Cotton Plan 2026, aimed at aggressively revivi­ng the country’s
declining
cotton production.
The plan, which consolidates various earlier proposals from the Ministry of Food Security and the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA), is expected to be presented to the deputy prime minister shortly, it has been learnt.
Implementation of the strategy is anticipated to significantly boost cotton yields, which would lead to a substantial reduction in the national
import
bill for cotton and edible oils.
The initiative comes amid inc­r­easing alarm over the continued decline in both the quantity and quality of Pakistan’s cotton output, despite multiple earlier efforts, sources say. Stakeholders, including the Cotton Ginners Forum, identify the failure to enforce crop zoning laws as the primary cause of the persistent decline.
Forum Chairman Ihsanul Haq stresses that cotton production and quality cannot improve unless there is a complete ban on sugarcane cultivation in designated cotton zones. Sugarcane cultivation in these areas is known to be detrimental to cotton crops.
He highlighted the superior quality of cotton grown in less-cultivated areas like Balochistan and Cholistan. Despite minimal use of fertilisers and micronutrients, the cotton produced there yields fiber with greater length and strength than conventional varieties.
This premium quality earns prices at least Rs500 per 40kg higher for raw cotton (phutti), while the cottonseed (banola) sells for at least Rs1,200 per 40kg more due to its higher oil content.

The FIR, a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
,  was registered at Moutra police station on behalf of Sub-Inspector Amir Ali Sindhu.
It invokes Sections 395 (punishment for dacoity), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy a house), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 324 (attempt to commit murder), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of a common object) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
In the FIR, the complainant said he, along with other policemen, was patrolling and checking security arrangements at Bhalowali Chowk on Sunday when they received reports around 8pm of some people having riled others up against the Ahmadi community and gathering them in large numbers at Piro Chak village. There were also reports of them looting and setting properties on fire.
“When I reached the spot, around 200-250 people armed with weapons and sticks were present there,” he said, adding that upon seeing the police, they lunged toward them and snatched weapons from two of the policemen.
According to the FIR, it was not possible for the police to immediately control the mob as law enforcement personnel were few in number. “So, I contacted the control room after which more personnel were sent,” the FIR quoted the complainant as saying.
He added that there was commotion at the site of the incident as residents were “terrorised”.
The complainant said the initial probe revealed that on September 21, a woman from the Ahmadi community had died in the village whose burial was not allowed. Meanwhile, he continued, “hatred on basis of religion and enmity” was promoted against the community, causing the law and order situation to deteriorate.
Five people were injured during this, the complainant said, adding that they were sent to the hospital.
The FIR said further facts of the incidents would become clear after the injured and affected people would be included in the inquiry.
It alleged the suspects of “deliberately promoting enmity against the Ahmadi community”, hurting their sentiments, setting their properties on fire, looting them, opening fire on them with the intention to kill, attacking a police party and snatching weapons from them and spreading fear among the residents of the area where the incident took place.
The complainant asked for an investigating officer to be assigned to probe the incident.
Meanwhile, Sialkot District Police Officer (DPO) Faisal Shehzad told
Dawn.com
on Sunday night that eight people were injured in the incident, “five of whom are from the Ahmadi community and three from the TLP (Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan)”.
He said among the injured from the Ahmadi community, one person was shot at, adding that condition of all the injured was stable.
The DPO also said the issue began when the burial of an Ahmadi woman was not allowed at a graveyard established in 1945. Later, some members of the Ahmadi community tortured some others. Two cases were registered — one against the members of the Ahmadi community and another against their adversaries, he added.
On Saturday, he continued, some members of the Ahmadi community “beat another person, following which TLP members set two to three of their farm houses and a shop on fire”. The official said they also “tortured” members of the Ahmadi community.
“Anti-riot police were called and situation is now normal,” he said, adding that “a case will be registered against (members of) the TLP”.
Sunday’s incident comes less than a months after
300 people were booked
on terrorism charges in two cases for setting two worship places of the Ahmadi community on fire in Faisalabad.
According to the FIRs, TLP ticket-holder Hafiz Rafaqat led the mob, which was armed with rods and bricks. Members of the community who tried to resist were severely beaten, leaving several injured.
Previously in July, 51 people were
arrested
and 142 booked for attacking police and an Ahmadi place of worship in Daska.
In April, a 46-year-old businessman was
lynched
when a few hundred supporters of the TLP had stormed a place of worship belonging to the Ahmadi community in Karachi’s Saddar area to prevent it from observing religious rituals.",2025-09-29,Imran Gabol,1185,0.000149

A meeting chaired by Price Control Department Secretary Dr Kiran Khurshid on Friday was told that wheat stocks in flour mills had increased by 165,000 metric tonnes this month. Additionally, the grinding of 360,000 metric tonnes of wheat has ensured the steady supply of flour.
The meeting was told that as Section 144 had been imposed against hoarders, the department was monitoring stored wheat stocks. Furthermore, the Punjab food directorate, district administrations, and Punjab enforcement and regulatory authority (Pera) had conducted operations at 2,095 locations across the province.
Dr Khurshid said the wheat price, which reached Rs3,800 per 40kg, had now fallen to Rs3,000 in the open market. The secretary instructed the Food DG to continue the crackdown against illegal hoarders across Punjab.
Strategic management wing also established to report demand and supply, availability and prices in local and international markets
The Punjab government has also established a strategic management wing (SMW) under the price control department. The secretary assigned Price Control Additional Director General (ADG) Azooba Azeem to supervise the SMW. Initiatially, eight research officers have been appointed in the wing. The wing will provide information regarding demand and supply of commodities, their availability and prices in both local and international markets.
Dr Khurshid said the purpose of the wing would be to integrate dashboards and portals of all subsidiary institutions of the department. It would also provide updates about the ongoing field operations and other initiatives of all relevant departments.
She said the SMW would also prepare recommendations for policy planning and the department’s new priorities. It would monitor departmental performance, track compliance, and key performance indicators (KPIs), she added.
Meanwhile, an operation was carried out against hoarders in Dera Ghazi Khan and Taunsa.
As much as 75,000 maunds of hoarded wheat was seized from two cotton factories in DG Khan.
Assistant Commissioner (Headquarters) Nazar Hussain Korai said that, as per the directives of the Punjab government, dealers and business owners had been instructed to declare their stock and register it with relevant authorities.
In Taunsa Sharif tehsil, under the supervision of Assistant Commissioner Nadeem Hashmi, a police squad also recovered large quantities of hoarded wheat and sealed 21 warehouses and shops.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943511/sikh-panel-flays-india-for-visa-denial-to-pilgrims,Sikh panel flays India for visa denial to pilgrims - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) has condemned the Indian government’s
repeated denial
of permission to Sikh pilgrims to visit Pakistan for their religious rituals and unanimously passed a resolution against this action.
The 9th meeting of the PSGPC was held at the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) head office under the chairmanship of PSGPC President and Punjab Minorities Minister Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora here on Saturday.
Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora said this act of the Indian government was a blatant violation of religious freedom and fundamental human rights, which had deeply hurt the sentiments of Sikhs around the world.
He said Pakistan had always welcomed Sikh pilgrims to sacred sites such as Nankana Sahib, Kartarpur, and Panja Sahib, yet the Indian government continued to deprive its own citizens of this basic right.
Following the Pahalgam terror attack in April last, the Indian government had
imposed a ban
on its citizens from travelling to Pakistan.
Mr Arora said Pakistan had introduced an online visa facility for pilgrims from around the world, especially from the UK, Canada, and the USA, to make it easier for them to visit Pakistan, whereas India was denying this very right to its own citizens.
ETPB Chairman Dr. Sajid Mahmood Chauhan said the government of Pakistan had always given top priority to the preservation and maintenance of gurdwaras and other sacred sites. Despite the recent floods, Kartarpur and other gurdwaras were reopened for pilgrims within 24 hours, which demonstrates Pakistan’s seriousness and commitment, he added.
Additional Secretary Shrines Nasser Mushtaq stated that PSGPC and ETPB were continuously working to enhance facilities for Sikh pilgrims and ensure complete religious freedom for those visiting Pakistan.
He said Pakistan was fully prepared to host Sikh pilgrims from India and across the world. “This is why pilgrims, upon returning home, chant ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ and carry messages of love and peace.”
The meeting also called upon the international community and the United Nations to take effective measures to stop India from violating religious freedom.
Those present at the meeting included PSGPC General Secretary Satwant Kaur, Vice President Sardar Mahesh Singh, Dr. Sardar Mimpal Singh, Sardar Tara Singh, Sardar Gyan Singh, Sardar Satwant Singh, Sardar Hameet Singh, Sardar Sahib Singh, and Sardar Bhagat Singh.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941113,Regional climate risks - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"WE in South Asia are the children of the monsoon, as described by David Jiménez in his 2008 book.
While governments may not always recognise it, we are bound by an ecosystem that inextricably links our resilience through shared climate realities from one end of South Asia to the other.
Shared ecosystems
1) Rivers:
The
Indus River system
serves as a central artery for India and Pakistan, comprising six major tributaries: eastern (Beas, Ravi, Sutlej) and western (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab).
These sha­red waters account for over 90 per cent of Pakis­tan’s agricultural use and support seven Indian states and territories: Punjab, Haryana, Chandi­garh, Indian-occupied Jammu & Kashmir, Rajas­than, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi. Heavy monsoons and poor transboundary management are increasingly causing deadly flooding in the Punjab and Sindh floodplains.
2) Mountains:
The Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalayan ranges have interconnected geological features. The Himalayan watershed exte­nds across northern India through occupied J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Ar­­u­nachal Pradesh, extending westward from Pak­is­­tan.
The Karakoram lies primarily in Gilgit-Bal­tistan and extends into disputed Ladakh and Aksai Chin. The Hindukush runs through Afghanistan into northwestern Pakistan, merging with the Karakoram at its eastern end.
These three ranges converge near Jaglot in northern Pakistan, where the Gilgit and Indus rivers meet. This complex system houses some of the world’s largest glaciers and has become a hotspot for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), creating a geologically volatile landscape.
Only coordinated Indo-Pakistani climate governance can prevent downstream disasters.
3) Deserts:
The Thar desert spans India and Pakistan, spreading desertification and drought in both countries.
This arid subtropical desert ex­­p­­eriences low irregular rainfall, soil erosion and water scarcity, driving demand for inter-basin tra­nsfers like the Beas–Bikaner and Indira Gandhi canals. Most of this desert lies in India, primarily Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana. The remainder extends into Pakistan’s drought-prone districts in Sindh and Punjab. The Pakistani Punjab portion is known as the
Cholistan desert
.
4) Coasts:
This maritime climate zone affects monsoon patterns, cyclones and ocean currents impacting India and Pakistan’s coastal weather.
Pakistan faces
transboundary threats
from powerful Arabian Sea tropical cyclones along India’s 2,500-kilometre western coastline.
Recent years have seen increased storm frequency and intensity, creating growing shared risks.
5) Delta:
The vast Indus delta mangroves are also divided. From Thatta, Badin, Sajawal and Karachi to India’s Gujarat coast, these mangroves depend on the Arabian Sea’s tidal waters and freshwater flows of the Indus that regulate salt levels, sediment and nutrients essential for growth.
The Rann of Kutch also straddles the border, with the larger portion in Gujarat and a smaller part in Sindh. It serves as a seasonal flooding basin during the monsoons, transforming itself from desert to marsh.
6) Interconnectedness:
Climate disasters create predictable chain reactions: upstream heatwaves trigger downstream flooding, mountain glacial bursts cause delta flooding, and Arabian Sea storms affect the entire coastal ecosystem.
Almost all climate-triggered events when originating in Indian states or held territory, cascade downstream to Pakistan. This upstream-downstream dynamic creates disaster chains that demand anticipatory joint management as the following three case studies demonstrate:
a) Kashmir floods:
In September 2014, unprecedented floods caused by heavy post-monsoon rains devastated the Kashmir region and downstream areas on both sides.
The disaster originated from Indian-held Kashmir’s meteorological conditions, with the Jhelum and Chenab swelling beyond danger levels, submerging Srinagar and numerous villages. The floods then followed the natural downstream flow into Pakistani Punjab, affecting over 1.1 million people and inundating more than 700 villages. Floodwaters breached riverbanks, displacing millions and causing deaths. This disaster demonstrated Pakistan’s vulnerability to upstream water management decisions and underscored the urgent need for shared early warning systems.
b) Transboundary heatwave:
The spring
2022 heatwave
originated in India’s northern plains before sweeping into Pakistan, breaking temperature records and reaching over 49 degrees Celsius in parts of Pakistan.
In India
, the heatwave severely damaged the wheat crop, reducing yields and spiking global wheat prices. As the heatwave moved downstream to Pakistan, it triggered accelerated glacier melt leading to Glofs and intensified rains that worsened the floods, submerging a third of the country and displacing millions. This event exemplified how atmospheric extremes originating upstream create compounding climate impacts downstream.
c) Arabian Sea cyclones:
Tropical cyclones for­ming in the Arabian Sea develop closer to India’s longer coastline before affecting Pakistan, following weather pattern movements. Cyclone Kyarr (2019), while not making landfall, caused coastal flooding and tidal surges in Maharashtra and Gujarat before impacting Sindh and Balochistan.
Cyclone Tauktae
(2021), one of the deadliest cyc­lones in the Arabian Sea, devastated India’s west coast before bringing destructive rain and ferocious winds, forcing evacuations and causing infrastructure disruptions. These events show how climate threats move from upstream origins to downstream impacts.
Global lessons
Despite having no diplomatic relations since 1993, Armenia and Türkiye demonstrate that shared dam management is possible even amid hostile political tensions, operating the Arpaçay Dam through monthly meetings that maintain equitable water-sharing based on agreements of 1927.
Conversely, Ethiopia’s unilateral construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam without downstream consent created permanent regional tensions with Egypt and Sudan, demonstrating precisely the type of conflict that cooperative management could prevent.
These shared ecological realities demand im­­mediate joint climate management between India and Pakistan. Each case study demonstrates how disasters originating in India cascade downstream to Pakistan, making collaborative early warning systems and shared water infrastructure management essential for Pakistan’s resilience. Without joint management of upstream barrages and da­­ms, Pakistan remains dangerously vulnerable to decisions made by upstream floodgate controllers.
A major lesson from the 2025 floods emerges: only coordinated Indo-Pakistani climate governance can prevent downstream disasters and eliminate suspicions of water terrorism. Joint management of upstream water infrastructure would ensure transparent, cooperative responses to extreme weather events, protecting both nations while building trust. The alternative is a continuation of cascading disasters that neither country can manage by itself.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942243/wheat-hoarding-scam-unearthed-in-sargodha,Wheat hoarding scam unearthed in Sargodha - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"SARGODHA: Abogus report claiming “no wheat stock” was submitted to the administration by the food department and a local feed/flour mills in Sargodha.
This misinformation was even shared with the Punjab director general (food) via a WhatsApp group, completely contradicting the reality on the ground.
The fraud came to light when the Shahpur assistant commissioner conducted a surprise raid and recovered over 60,000 bags (6,000 metric tonnes) of wheat stored at Sultan Feed Mills, contradicting the written report submitted by Grain Food Inspector Muhammad Aslam, who had falsely stated that not a single sack of wheat was present.
Following the raid, the Sargodha deputy commissionerreprimanded District Food Controller Mudassar Javed, labeling the submission of fake data as a criminal act and gross misuse of authority.
Bogus report shows ‘no stock’
According to sources, under a province-wide directive to register wheat stocks to stabilise prices, flour mill owners and food department officers in Sargodha colluded to misreport or conceal actual stock levels. Many stockists secretly shifted wheat to undisclosed locations, while others declared significantly reduced inventories or submitted entirely fake reports through food officers.
The assistant commissioners were independently tasked with verifying these stock declarations. During these checks, it was discovered that multiple officers knowingly submitted false data, with clear indications of collusion.
In Sargodha alone, more than 100,000 metric tonnes of wheat is suspected to have been hidden, raising concerns about intentional hoarding to manipulate market prices, which experts consider a criminal conspiracy against national interest.
While a show cause notice has been issued to Inspector Muhammad Aslam under the Peeda Act, sources claim this is only a formality and no substantive action has yet been taken against the mill owners or key facilitators within the food department.
Both the district food controller and the inspector were reluctant to respond.
ENCOUNTER: A notorious criminal identified as Javed, aresident of 96 SB, was killed in a police ‘encounter’ while his accomplices managed to escape during an attempted robbery near Chak 92-SB.
According to police sources, a 15 emergency call was received around, reporting that armed individuals were committing a robbery in the area. When police arrived at the scene, they were met with gunfire from the suspects.
An exchange of fire ensued between the robbers and the police. During the encounter, Javed was fatally shot. His accomplices, however, managed to flee under the cover of darkness.
Police are conducting raids to arrest the remaining suspects. The body of the deceased robber has been shifted to the local hospital for autopsy. A case has been registered.
RAPE: A 45-year-old resident of Chak 129 NB was booked for allegedly raping a fourth-grade student for six months.
When the girl developed abdominal pain, it was revealed that the girl had conceived. Salanwali police have registered a case on the complaint of the girl’s father.

• Water levels at Panjnad drop, but dykes still overflowing
• PDMA issues alert for fresh spell of heavy monsoon rains; PMD warns of dengue outbreak
LAHORE/Islamabad: Flood­waters from the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers
continued
to inundate vast areas of Multan, Baha­walpur, Lodhran, Muzaffargarh and Khanewal districts on Monday,
displacing
thousands of people and damaging infrastructure.
Controlled breaches meant to divert the rivers’ flow have failed to contain the deluge, submerging dozens of villages and crippling major transport routes.
Authorities carried out a controlled breach at Noraja Bhutta Bund in Jalalpur Pirwala to ease pressure from the swelling Sutlej. However, the water surged towards Gillani Road, prompting a second breach that ultimately flooded both urban localities and rural settlements.
Floodwaters reached Sukkur-Multan Motorway, forcing its closure for the past two days. The Jalalpur Pirwala Interchange and surrounding areas are now underwater. Villages, including Noraja Bhutta, Mouza Kanu, Wasti Sardar Mir Chakar Khan, Sardarabad, Tar­anda Basharat and Rasoolpur, have been submerged. Union councils such as Chenab Rasoolpur and Khair­­pur Jadeed are also severely affected.
Rescue teams recovered the body of a 65-year-old man from Bahadar­pur, near the Jalalpur Interchange. In Alipur tehsil, the Azmatpur dyke continues to cause flooding in low-lying areas despite a significant drop in water levels at Panjnad Headworks from 700,000 to 296,000 cusecs.
Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said traffic was completely suspended from Multan to Uch Sharif due to the motorway being inundated. He added that the district administration was working to protect the Jalalpur Pirwala section of the motorway amid the worsening flood situation.
During his visit to the Jalalpur Interchange, National Highway Au­­thority and motorway officials brie­fed him on the condition of the rou­te. DC Sindhu said floodwater from the Gillani Road breach ent­e­red the motorway, leading to its complete closure between Multan and Uch Sharif. He added that urgent efforts were underway to seal the breach to prevent further damage.
He said water levels were receding at the flood embankments of Basti Inayatpur and Mauza Dhondhu, while flood relief camps had been established to provide necessary facilities to the displaced. According to him, water levels are expected to return to normal within the next 24 hours.
11th monsoon spell
Meanwhile, the Punjab Provin­cial Disaster Management Auth­ority (PDMA) issued an alert for the 11th spell of monsoon rains beginning today (Tuesday).
On Sept 18 and 19, an increase in water flow is expected in streams and nullahs of Rawalpindi, Murree and Galiyat. The PDMA has direc­ted all commissioners and deputy commissioners to remain alert as flooding risks persist in major cities.
The PDMA also released a flood damage report, with Relief Com­missioner Nabil Javaid saying that over 4,700 villages have been affected due to severe flooding in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers.
He said 2,484 villages have been inundated by the Chenab, 719 by the Sutlej and 1,458 by the Ravi. In total, 4.72 million people have been affected, with 2.564m evacuated to safe locations.
He added that 372 relief camps, 454 medical camps and 385 veterinary camps have been established in severely affected districts. About 2.07m animals have also been relocated during the rescue and relief operations.

Dengue warning
Keeping in view past trends, the current and future climate outlook and the extensive flooding across the country, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has warned of a favourable environment for a dengue outbreak.
Dengue fever has become a persistent threat to public health in Pakistan over the last decade, with major outbreaks reported during the post-monsoon season (Sept 20 to Dec 5).
In its dengue alert, the PMD stated that the combined impact of favourable weather thresholds and flood-related waterlogging has created conducive conditions for the onset of dengue from Sept 20.
Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Sukkur, Hyderabad and Multan, as well as flood-affected areas across the country, are at high risk of a severe dengue outbreak.
The PMD advised all stakeholders, including district administrations, health departments, and the general public, to immediately adopt pre-emptive measures to counter the risk of a dengue outbreak in vulnerable areas.

travel ban
on Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) chief Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal illegal, directing authorities to immediately lift the restriction.
The division bench, comprising Chief Justice Rozi Khan Bareech and Justice Sardar Ahmed Halimi, delivered the verdict during a hearing of a constitutional petition filed by senior lawyer Sajid Tareen Advocate.
After hearing arguments from the petitioner and BNP’s Central Secretary Information Agha Hassan Baloch Advocate, the bench ordered the removal of Mengal’s name from the no-fly list.
Officials’ absence irks bench
At a separate hearing, the same bench expressed dissatisfaction over prolonged power outages and the absence of senior officials the court had earlier summoned.

The court had ordered the chief secretary of Balochistan, the CEO of the Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco), and the principal secretary to the CM to appear in person with a report on electrifying solar tube wells and reducing loadshedding.
Qesco’s legal adviser Barrister Muzaffar Azam informed the court that the CEO was “busy in Islamabad” and could not attend the hearing. No report was submitted on behalf of the Additional Advocate General.
The court noted that Qesco officials were disconnecting household connections attached to tube wells without notice, causing severe hardship for farmers. It observed that widespread power loadshedding was disrupting education, office and business activities.
Detailed report sought
Subsequently, the court directed the three officials to appear in person at the next hearing on Oct 7 and submit detailed replies.
Additionally, the bench expressed strong displeasure over traffic disruptions at Lakpass Tunnel and sought a detailed report from relevant authorities.
The court declared a report from the Deputy Commissioner of Mastung “unsatisfactory” and ordered him to appear at the next hearing with a comprehensive plan to improve traffic flow.
The bench remarked that criminal activities and public problems around the tunnel have been rising for the past year.
Despite repeated calls, the petitioner’s lawyer did not appear, however, according to the petition, Levies, Customs, and FC North posts at the tunnel, which connects Quetta with several districts, often cause vehicles to be “stuck for hours”.
The court directed the Deputy Attorney General and FC North’s counsel to explain at the next hearing why the check points had not been shifted to a more suitable location.

According to Suparco, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are completely safe to observe with the naked eye, binoculars or telescopes.
In a press release on Saturday, the space agency said that the eclipse will be visible in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe, with clear visibility expected in most regions of Pakistan if the weather permits.
“The event will start at 8:30pm and reach its maximum at 11:57pm,” the press release read, stating that the eclipse will conclude at 1:55am.
“This is a great chance for people, especially students and astronomy enthusiasts, to connect with science and explore the wonders of our universe,” a Suparco spokesperson was quoted as saying.
Sunday’s eclipse is also known as a “
blood moon
”, due to its red hue during the event. When the Sun, Earth and Moon line up, the shadow cast by the planet on its satellite makes it appear an eerie, deep red colour that has astounded humans for millennia.
The Moon appears red during lunar eclipses because the only sunlight reaching it is “reflected and scattered through the Earth’s atmosphere”, said Ryan Milligan, an astrophysicist at Northern Ireland’s Queen’s University Belfast.
The last total lunar eclipse was in March this year, while the one before that was in 2022. A rare total solar eclipse, when the Moon blocks out the light from the Sun, will be visible in a sliver of Europe on August 12, 2026.",2025-09-06,Umaid Ali,422,9.2e-05

A first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Sukkur’s Kandhra police station under sections 114 (abettor present), 428 (mischief by killing or maiming animal with value of Rs10 or more), 429 (killing or maiming cattle, etc, of any value), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on the complaint of Ghulam Mustafa.
The incident took place at 2pm yesterday, according to the FIR, wherein three suspects were nominated.
According to the complainant, when his camels were returning after drinking water from a pond on the land, one of the suspects hit one of them with an axe, breaking its leg. Then he dragged the camel with his tractor.
The complainant said he kept pleading with the suspects to spare the camel, but they did not listen.
According to the FIR, the suspects reacted angrily, saying that the camel had destroyed crops.
Sukkur Senior Superintendent of Police Azhar Mughal said while speaking to the media that police had arrested two of the suspects.
This was also confirmed in a post on X by the  Sindh Chief Minister House’s official account. It said that police had so far arrested two suspects and the hunt for a third suspect was under way.
The statement also condemned the “the gruesome” attack, adding that the CM had ordered strict action against the culprits.
On the CM Murad Ali Shah’s directive, Sukkur District Council Chairman Syed Kumail Hyder Shah was “supervising” the injured camel’s treatment, it added.
Kumail Shah also posted about the incident on X, saying: “Heartbreaking to witness such cruelty against a helpless camel in Rohri.
“I’ve personally spoken to the owner, the wounded camel has been shifted to Karachi for immediate treatment. No animal should ever suffer such cruelty, every life, human or voiceless, deserves compassion and care.”
Separately, Sukkur Commissioner Abid Saleem told
Dawn.com
on the phone that the camel was shifted to Karachi after coordination with a private sector organisation that deals with such cases of injuries.
He said the camel would undergo surgery on its leg, adding that she had also sustained injuries on her jaw.
Meanwhile, the Comprehensive Disaster Response Services (CDRS) Benji Project for Animal Welfare in Karachi, which had helped
another mutilated camel
stand back with a prosthetic leg, said earlier today that its veterinary doctors would examine the camel.
“On Friday, September 19, a two-year-old female camel suffered unspeakable abuse in Sukkur. She had wandered onto land in search of water, where the landowner viciously broke her leg and then dragged her with a tractor,” the CDRS project wrote in a post on Instagram.
The organisation said it “immediately began coordinating with the Government of Sindh to rescue her”, adding that it was extremely grateful to Faryal Talpur, Sukkur MPA Awaiz Shah and MPA Sumeta Syed “for their efforts in helping us secure this camel […] and for so vehemently taking action”.
“Once our vets have examined her properly, we will share an update,” CDRS said, affirming that its team will try its “very best to give her love, comfort, and some semblance of peace”.

“There are no words left to explain the cruelty we continue to see. It is unimaginably painful to witness these beautiful, voiceless beings — created in such perfection and innocence — suffering at the hands of humans who were meant to protect them. All we can do is keep standing up for them and take one day at a time,” CDRS wrote.
A statement from CM Shah’s office said the camel was
moved
to the CDRS shelter and
named
“Sumi”.
It added that as per the shelter administration, her leg was crushed, jaw was broken, tongue was burnt and there were serious injuries on her body. The chief minister was told that she could not eat and was being administered intravenous fluids.
“On the instructions of the Sindh CM, Livestock Secretary Kazim Jatoi has been entrusted with the responsibility of providing the best treatment for Sumi,” the statement said.
The shelter posted various videos on its Facebook page of the
treatment
being provided to her.
The recent incident bears similarity to that of Cammie, a camel who had her front leg
chopped off
allegedly by a landlord in June 2024 as punishment for foraging in his field for fodder. She was taken in by the CDRS Benji Project, where she got her prosthetic leg in July and is still
in care

• Meets CPC leader Li Shulei; conveys commitment to political, economic, and cultural cooperation.
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness to work with China and other natio­­ns to expand cultural exchanges, strengthen creative industries and promote understanding and a culture of tolerance.
He said culture remained a vital bridge to peace, prosperity, and a shared future for humanity.
The president addressed the Second Golden Panda Awards International Culture Forum in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China, where he highlighted the power of art and culture in uniting people and connecting civilisations.
The forum was attended by senior Chinese leaders, cultural representatives, artists and international delegates, President Secretariat Press Wing said in a press release.
President Zardari underlined that the enduring Pakistan-China friendship stood as a model of mutual respect and cooperation.
As the two countries prepare to celebrate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year, he recalled that this partnership remained not only strategic but also a living testimony of the deep bonds of friendship between their peoples.
He reiterated Pakistan’s full support for China’s vision of civilisational exchange and mutual learning. He also emphasised the significance of the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), and the Global Governance Initiative (GGI), noting their focus on sustainable development, regional stability, and inclusive international cooperation.
The president underscored the importance of the GGI, which promotes respect for the diversity of civilisations, equality among cultures, people-to-people exchan­ges, and cultural dialogue as a counter to narratives of a clash of civilisations.
He observed that the world was undergoing dramatic changes, and praised China under President Xi Jinping for offering a path of cooperation and win-win solutions instead of confrontation.
He said that he was immensely impressed by how these initiatives served the common values of humanity.
President Zardari congratulated the award winners and appreciated their creativity, noting that such artistic endeavours transcend borders and bring people together through shared human values.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari held a meeting with Li Shulei, member of the Political Bureau and Secretariat of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, and Minister of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee in Chengdu, China.
During the meeting, the president emphasised the importance of expanding cooperation betw­een Pakistan and China in political, economic and cultural fields, underlining Pakistan’s commitment to deepening people-to-people contacts and public diplomacy.
He thanked the CPC leader for hosting him in Sichuan and felicitated him and the organisers on the successful holding of the Second Golden Panda Awards International Culture Forum.
Mr Shulei said that President Xi Jinping had sent his best wishes and greetings to President Zardari and recalled their meeting during the president’s visit in February this year.
He also appreciated President Zardari’s recent article in
China Daily
, underlining the high regard in which Pakistan’s perspectives were held in China.
He further observed that both he and President Xi highly valued the leadership shown by President Zardari in strengthening the Pakistan-China partnership.
The world is changing, but China and Pakistan will remain iron-clad brothers.
“Today, the world needs and deserves the fragrance of books rather than the smell of gunpowder,” he said.

White House visit
, former ambassadors have hailed the remarkable turnaround in Pakistan-US ties following the ebb during the Biden administration.
But diplomatic observers are quick to add a warning: the roller coaster nature of relations in the past, which saw several highs and many lows, warrants caution.
Maleeha Lodhi, who previously served as Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations and is a former ambassador to the US, termed the continuing warming of relations between the US and Pakistan a “remarkable turnaround” after ties had plunged to a low in the wake of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.
“The meeting has injected greater momentum to the reset of Pakistan-US ties,” she said, adding that inviting a Pakistani premier to the White House after six years reflected “renewed US recognition of Pakistan’s geopolitical importance in the region and the Middle East at a time of changing international dynamics”.
Lodhi terms post-Biden thaw ‘remarkable turnaround’; Masood Khan welcomes revival of intelligence cooperation
“But an assessment of the significance of the White House meeting has to wait for details of what was discussed and which areas the two countries have agreed to cooperate in,” Ms Lodhi added.
“Caution is warranted by the roller coaster nature of relations in the past, which saw several highs and many lows,” she said.
Sardar Masood Khan, a former ambassador to the US, UN and China, described the White House me­­eting as a “new strategic mom­ent” in Islamabad-Washington relations.
In a statement, he said that while the optics of the meeting were encouraging, the real substance lay in new frameworks of cooperation on peace, security and economic transformation.
“Pakistan and Saudi Arabia’s unity has been pivotal in persuading President Trump and his team to avoid escalation in Gaza and to work instead toward a sustainable solution for Palestine. The roadmap presented by US Special Envoy Steven Witkoff is evidence that our diplomacy is being recognised,” he added.
On bilateral matters, he said the meeting produced significant economic openings, including reduced tariffs on Pakistani exports and agreements on critical minerals, renewable energy, cryptocurrency and oil exploration.
Mr Khan also welcomed the rev­ival of intelligence cooperation be­­tween the two countries, recalling Pakistan’s past collaboration with US agencies in counterterrorism.
“The renewed focus will address threats emanating from Afgha­nis­tan, Daesh and the Tehreek-i-Tali­b­­an Pakistan (TTP), while also spotlighting India’s extensive terror networks in the region,” he said.
He claimed that India had established operational and financial infrastructures targeting Pakistan and said both Islamabad and Washington had now agreed to dismantle these threats together.

• Speakers urge restoration of drainage channels, adoption of long-term, people-friendly strategy
KARACHI: The Urban Resource Centre (URC) on Tuesday organised talks by experts, architect and town planner Arif Hasan and NED Professor Dr Noman Ahmed, about the current
flooding situation
in big cities such as Karachi during the
monsoon rains
.
In his talk, titled ‘Understanding the impacts of monsoon rains and flooding in Pakistan’, professor Ahmed pointed out that the usual monsoon pattern has now changed, as the average rainfall recorded this year in major cities such as Karachi, Lahore, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Sargodha and Kasur was higher than usual.
“The low-lying areas are flooded almost as soon as it rains and citizens find themselves surrounded by water, wondering how to save their belongings,” said Professor Ahmed.
“Ironically, while the roads are inundated, the rainwater drains do not receive rainwater,” he pointed out. “It is because while building roads we left no margin or option for the water to flow out. New development projects have also blocked all drainage, as no one thinks about such things while planning construction,” he said.
“During the heavy rain on August 19, even the vehicles brought in to clean or pump out the water from Sharea Faisal themselves stopped working as the water went into their engines,” he added.
He said that normally all the rainwater should channel out to the river or sea through storm-water drains, which does not happen. He showed, with the help of maps, how rivers such as the Sutlej and Ravi in Punjab overflowed into nearby settlements.
Professor Ahmed said that the government needs to have a comprehensive strategy to manage exceptional rain and flooding events. He also suggested that they restore natural drainage channels in and around the cities, and train, equip and mobilise a volunteer force for emergency services.
Meanwhile, Mr Hasan said that water naturally flows down from the north or hilly areas to the sea in the south, but the areas it is supposed to flow through have townships now. One good example of this is Saadi Town and the other townships around it.
“You don’t meddle with nature like that. The first thing before building a settlement somewhere is to see if it is not in the way of the flow of water,” he said. “Then even the roads here are built higher and higher, while not allowing the water to flow down,” he added.
“The URC carried out a detailed survey of drains in 2020 and found that some 30 of the 34 smaller drains flowing into the big Mahmoodabad drain were blocked. The Mahmoodabad drain, too, has 18 points from where the water should flow out, though there only four happened to be open, as the remaining 14 were blocked. So the outflow is weak,” he said.
He also said that during the rains, water on the roofs of around 2.7 million houses and buildings in Karachi flows down onto the roads. But there has been no research or study carried out to see how to get this water to the Lyari or Malir rivers.
“All one needs is some common sense here to come up with long-term solutions. Here we have rendered people homeless to clean the Gujjar, Orangi or Mahmoodabad nullahs and still the flooding issue could not be resolved,” he said.
“When coming up with solutions, we should not ignore or lose sight of the people,” he reminded. “Come up with people-friendly solutions because with global warming the temperature in the mountains is rising, which means more water will flow down into the rivers while we here are senselessly settling down on floodplains,” he added.
Earlier, Zahid Farooq, one of the organisers, mentioned the rain on August 19, which affected every citizen of Karachi, rich or poor, in the same way.
Many people attending the talk also shared their bad experiences due to the urban flooding on that day.
A one-minute latest video of flooding at main NIPA Chowrangi on Tuesday was also shared with the audience to show that the water has still not cleared in several areas.

auctioned
permits for 118 animals, including four Astore markhors, 100 Himalayan ibex, and 14 blue sheep — for the 2025–26 hunting season.
GB’s trophy hunting programme involves local communities, who receive about 80 per cent of hunting revenues for conservation and development projects. While it has been credited with protecting endangered species, stakeholders fear the latest price hikes could jeopardise its sustainability.
The bidding ceremony was held today at the Forest, Parks and Wildlife Complex in Gilgit, where a large number of outfitters and hunters participated in an auction.
Shikar Safari’s owner, Raja Farhad Maqpoon, placed the highest bid of $370,000 and won the Astore markhor hunting permit at the Nanga Parbat conservancy area in Astore, while the second bidder won the Astore markhor hunting permit for $286,000, the third for $270,000 and the fourth permit for $240,000, respectively.
The highest bid of $40,000 was placed by Muhammad Ali Nagri from Markhor Safaris for a Blue sheep permit, and the same bidder also placed $13,000 for a Himalayan ibex and won both.
GB conservator for Parks and Wildlife, Khadim Abbas, told
Dawn.com
that for the upcoming season, the base price of an Astore markhor permit was raised to $200,000, while blue sheep and Himalayan ibex permits are set at $30,000 and $10,000, respectively.
Last year, the base rates were lower: $150,000 for markhor, $9,000 for blue sheep and $5,500 for ibex. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa wildlife department had auctioned the highest rate Markhor hunting permit in Chitral for
$271,000
.
In the 2024-25 season, the highest bid for a markhor reached $161,000, earning the GB government more than Rs30 million.
Separately, local outfitters and tour operators argued that the sharp fee hikes were damaging their businesses and discouraging international clients.
They warned of losses for both outfitters and the local communities that relied on trophy hunting revenue.
Ikram Beg, a Gilgit-based outfitter, said participation in the programme had dropped due to inflated rates, causing “devastating” impacts on livelihoods.
“Trophy hunting can either remain a success story in GB or fade into history as a failed experiment. The choice lies in the wisdom and vision of the communities that are its true custodians,” he said.
He added that such decisions changed the objectives of the programme as the trophy hunting programme was not supposed to be a commercial endeavour.

The country was
placed
on Wada’s watchlist in September 2024 over outstanding non-conformities to the agency’s updated anti-doping code.
According to the spokesperson, WADA confirmed that the compliance procedure against Pakistan’s Anti-Doping Organisation (Adop) was closed after all pending corrective actions were completed.
“A follow-up confirmation from Wada in September reiterated that Pakistan was no longer under enhanced monitoring, ending speculation over possible sanctions,” the statement said.
PSB Deputy Director General (DG) Shahid Islam was informed of the decision by Wada via email, the PSB spokesperson told
Dawn.com
.
The statement also said that corrective measures were put under PSB DG Yasir Pirzada’s leadership, including policy alignment and procedural reforms, ensuring that Pakistan met the stringent global standards in time.
“This is not just a bureaucratic victory; it is a lifeline for Pakistani athletes and sports federations,” Pirzada was quoted as saying.
“For a country preparing to showcase itself on major sporting platforms, this clearance from Wada marks a vital step forward,” the statement added.
It also highlighted that the failure to meet critical anti-doping requirements by January would trigger automatic non-compliance, which “could have barred Pakistani athletes from competing under the national flag and risked international isolation in sport”.
Last year, Wada placed seven national anti-doping organisations on a watchlist, giving them four more months “to correct outstanding non-conformities” to a new anti-doping code. The countries included Namibia, Pakistan, Panama, Samoa, Senegal, Uganda and Uruguay.
In May, the body’s president Witold Banka
pushed back
against what he called the growing politicisation of efforts to stem the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. “The politicisation of anti-doping is something which is very concerning,” he said.
“We see more and more attempts to politicise the anti-doping environment. There is no place for politics or turf wars in the fight for clean sport,” he added.",2025-09-12,Umaid Ali,557,0.000102
https://www.dawn.com/news/1945294/tribal-journalists-resent-lack-of-access-to-information,Tribal journalists resent ‘lack of access’ to information - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"KHYBER: Khyber journalists said on Sunday that ‘lack’ of access to information and official verification of news stories were the main hindrances in performance of their professional duties.
Speaking on the occasion of World News Day and the International Day for Universal Access to Information, the journalists’ fraternity said most government departments and institutions were not cooperating with them in ascertaining factual official versions on a certain issue pertaining to their performance.
They said instead of furnishing verified information, the so-called ‘official sources’ were constantly involved in exploitation of the tribal journalists.
Khadim Khan Afridi, a senior journalist from Bara, said though access to information was a fundamental human right, it was denied to them despite the existence of the right to information department in the province, which provided very limited and mutilated information to tribal journalists whenever it was approached.
He said in the current environment of information technology and social media, false news was rapidly shared and spread in a very limited period of time while factual stories were denied space in the mainstream media due to the mad race for ‘breaking news’.
He said in most cases local journalists were denied permission to official functions or ceremonies.
Aman Ali, president of District Press Club, Landi Kotal, said alongside the limited access to official information, the so-called tribal customs and traditions too prevented them from digging out stories, which were in conflict with these traditions.
He lamented that the poor salary structure of tribal journalists was also a reason, affecting their profession.
He said lack of required facilities and absence of a well-equipped press club was also a major factor in their failure to cope with the actual requirements of journalism. “We still are working in a rented building with no official assistance,” he lamented.
Khoyal Mat Shah Afridi, another journalist, said the district administration, the police department and other law enforcement agencies were not cooperating in furnishing the required information on time.
He said the government departments and the district administration were yet to acquire the services of a capable and qualified focal person, who could professionally handle their media affairs.

In a statement issued on Sunday, the COG said it was aware that a version of its report on the 2024 Pakistan general elections was circulating online, adding that they did not comment on leaked documents as a matter of policy.
C’wealth says report shared with govt, ECP; will be released this month
“The government and the Election Commission of Pakis­tan have already received the report. The full report, as we had communicated earlier,  will be released later this month, along with a number of COG reports currently in the publication pipeline,” the statement said.
The COG also maintained that its work is “carried out free from any interference”.
While announcing its preliminary findings on Feb 10, 2024, the COG had said that its findings and recommendations would be submitted to the Commonwealth secretary general, before being shared with the Pakistani government, and shared publicly.
The mission’s report has faced an inordinate delay, as most observation missions compile their findings and publish them within days or weeks of their compilation.
According to an excerpt from the leaked copy — whose authenticity could not be independently verified by
Dawn
— the report stated that: “Despite the fact that early vote counts indicated a landslide victory for candidates aligned with… the banned PTI… saw their polling leads rapidly reversed…”
In a statement issued on Sunday, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram said the leaked report validated PTI’s longstanding reservations about widespread pre- and post-poll rigging.
Zulfi Bukhari, a former aide to ex-PM Imran Khan, also raised questions about why the report was never released.
“Tomorrow, I will be consulting legal counsel to initiate proceedings aimed at securing disclosure, both of the report itself in full and of the decision-making processes that led to its suppression,” he
wrote
on X.

•  Says any project in Karachi should be executed through local agencies
KARACHI: The municipal leadership of Karachi has challenged the authority of the federal government by questioning the role of its Pakistan Infrastructure Development Company Ltd (PIDCL) in the urban development projects, insisting that all such initiatives in Karachi should fall under the city’s municipal jurisdiction.
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), backed by the PPP-led Sindh government, has halted the federally funded Rs6 billion project of the Green Line Bus extension, citing the PIDCL’s failure to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from municipal authorities before restarting the work.
After the abolition of the Pakistan Works Department, the federal government assigns uplift works to the PIDCL, established under the
Companies Act
, 2017, in different parts of the country.
The work on the Green Line extension was
restarted
more than nine years after its ground-breaking around two weeks ago.
However, the construction between the Numaish intersection and the Municipal Park near Jama Cloth Market was stopped by Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab last week, citing “procedural violations”.
KMC officials said that an NOC was not issued “in perpetuity”, and the PIDCL was required to secure a fresh approval for the work on the BRT extension phase.
In a statement, the mayor also presented a demand of rehabilitation of infrastructure, which was damaged during the construction work of the first phase of the project completed more than three years ago.
He said due to the negligence and mismanagement of “other institutions”, citizens of Karachi and the KMC continued to bear the brunt of criticism and inconvenience.
However, the situation is far more complex. In a conversation with
Dawn
, Karachi Mayor Wahab spoke openly, expressing his desire to completely exclude the PIDCL from the city’s infrastructure development works.
“Yes, absolutely,” he responded without hesitation when asked if he wished to “minus” the PIDCL from Karachi’s development projects.
“Any project in Karachi — regardless of whether it’s funded by the federal government — should be executed through local agencies,” Mayor Wahab asserted.
“If a project pertains to a town, then the respective of town administration should handle it. If it concerns the city as a whole, we [KMC] will take responsibility. We are the ones answerable to the people — they come to us with questions. Most of them don’t even know who the head of PIDCL is.”
The mayor said he had the full backing of the Sindh government in perusing this policy.
He added that he had even raised concerns over the slow progress of the
Red Line
BRT project, which is being executed by the provincial administration.
“But there’s a difference,” he explained. “I’m part of the advisory body overseeing the execution of the Red Line BRT. I raise questions in meetings, I demand explanations, and I get a clear picture of what’s happening. But when it comes to the PIDCL-led Green Line project, I’m completely in the dark — yet I’m still held accountable and face public criticism.”
As the city administration sticks firm to its demands, the federal government appears to be little impressed over the objections raised by the mayor on the extension of the Green Line BRT project. It has not formally responded to the KMC’s concerns despite passage of several days after suspension of the work.
A source privy to the situation said that the PIDCL officials made an immediate contact with the mayor when the work was stopped.
It was decided between the two sides that they would sit together on Friday last to sort out issues.
“But since then no meeting has been held,” said the sources. “The federal authorities now believe that the matter lies between the Karachi mayor and the contractor. As for the NOC, the PIDCL is already in possession of one issued by the KMC in October 2017, rendering the current argument over the NOC irrelevant,” they added.

A notification has been issued in this regard on the directions of Housing Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal.
According to a spokesperson for the housing department, development authorities, horticulture agencies, and Wasa agencies would provide resources for relief operations in the affected districts.
The notification said that development authorities and horticulture agencies would extend all possible support to the districts.
Uninterrupted supply of clean drinking water in flood relief camps would be ensured, while officers had been directed to remain present in the relief camps of the affected districts round-the-clock.
The spokesperson said that officers and employees of development authorities and horticulture agencies would work under Wasa’s disposal so that relief operation could be made faster and more effective.

Her statement comes a day after Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari
said
that the provincial government would issue relief cards to the flood victims in their personal names using its own resources instead of using BISP to assist them. Over the past month, the PPP has repeatedly
urged
the Centre to disburse stipends among displaced citizens via the “efficient and proven” BISP.
BISP is a national safety net programme in Pakistan that provides cash assistance to poor and vulnerable families, particularly targeting women.
In a post on X, Aseefa said that over four million people had been impacted by the “unprecedented floods” in Punjab. She termed the BISP as the “fastest and most effective way” to distribute aid to those affected.
“Not utilising one of the state’s key organisations, which has both the data and the capacity to deliver assistance, would be irresponsible,” she said.
Over the past weeks, the PPP chairman and senior leaders have encouraged the use of the flagship income support initiative to provide relief to thousands of citizens affected by the monsoon
floods.
PPP Vice President Sherry Rehman had “strongly and repeatedly” advocated the use of BISP for the purpose in a Senate committee meeting.
In yesterday’s press conference, Azma Bukhari had said that the relief cards would ensure that help reaches the right people, adding that the government was focused on “serving, not politicising” the issue.
The minister, taking a jibe at PPP’s insistence over BISP use, remarked, “Should we take advice from those who have turned Sindh into archaeological ruins?”
At present, the Punjab government has announced a compensation package for the flood-hit families, which includes Rs20,000 per acre for crop loss, Rs1 million for completely destroyed homes, Rs500,000 for partially damaged homes, and Rs500,000 for the loss of cattle.
On September 18, PML-N leader and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah had
ruled out
the use of BISP in helping flood-affected people, calling it unviable for a cash-strapped government. Rana Sana said the BISP could not be continued in its current form — it either needed to be wrapped up or be completely revamped.",2025-09-24,Dawn.com,613,0.000106

However, flood victims have alleged discriminatory behaviour in relief efforts. They claim that
Ganda Singh Talwar post
has received undue attention due to visits by ministers and prominent political figures, while other severely affected areas like Kanganpur, Mandi Usmanwala, and Balloki, where relief camps were officially set up are being neglected.
During a provincial assembly session on Saturday, PML-N MPA Ahsan Raza openly criticised his own government for the allegedly biased distribution of aid. He accused the administration of favouritism in distributing food and fodder, particularly at politically significant points.
Flood victims across multiple areas continue to face severe hardships due to a shortage of boats. This shortage has not only hampered evacuation efforts but also delayed the supply of essential food, fodder, and medicines. Welfare organisations and stranded villagers seeking transport have reported waiting for hours, as boats were allegedly diverted for VIP movement and political visits.
DC denies charges of discrimination in distribution
An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, lamented the scene at Ganda Singh Talwar, describing it as a recreational park for some people while it was a ray of hope for the stranded people waiting for food, fodder and medicines.At Kothi Fateh Muhammad, downstream from Sutlej, the water level has reached 15 feet, damaging dozens of villages.
The Ravi at Head Baloki is also experiencing a high flood, with 125,000 cusecs of water discharge, slightly reduced from a peak of 148,000 cusecs over the past 24 hours.
At Ganda Singh Headworks, the flood situation remains critical, with a discharge of 319,295 cusecs recorded on Monday. The region has been grappling with this emergency for nearly a week. Over 70 villages have been submerged and thousands of acres of crops have been destroyed.
Local residents reported that only five boats were available in the Mandi Usmanwala area on Monday. One boat broke down, and the remaining four were preoccupied with searching for the body of a youth who drowned while filming a TikTok video. As a result, no aid official or private could reach around a dozen villages due to the unavailability of boats.
In Kanganpur and Kothi Fateh Muhammad, a similar shortage persists. In case of medical emergencies, residents of villages like Doana, Shahbazkay, Rukanpura, Muradkay, Khanay Peer, and Sher Kot reportedly have to wait several hours for a boat.
In Phoolnagar’s Kamogil village, the revenue department declined to repair a broken embankment, citing the lack of machinery. Villagers later restored the dyke through self-help efforts.
Private welfare organisations remain active in delivering aid to remote villages, including Kamogil, Nathay Jageer, Jaja Kalan, Chatri, Wazirpur, Thama Kamyana, and Dalu Multani. Residents say official relief from the district or provincial government in these areas is rare.
Tensions also arose earlier when the district administration reportedly dismantled a relief camp run by a political party merely because it had banners displaying the party leader’s picture even though it was operating during a medium flood phase.
Speaking to
Dawn
, Deputy Commissioner Imran Ali said the administration had deployed 85 boats across the district.He said the boats had been distributed as per the population proportion so that all could be helped.He denied allegations of discrimination and claimed that on Monday alone, 2,000 food boxes and ration bags were delivered.
The DC added that 250,000 people from 72 villages and hamlets have been displaced by the floods. So far, 95,000 people have been transported to safer areas, while 113,000 remain stranded in submerged zones. He emphasised that food and fodder are being provided without bias, in accordance with the vision of the Punjab chief minister.

According to a copy of the petition dated June 16, available with
Dawn.com
, a writ petition filed in December last year sought the conclusion of an inquiry against former Punjab finance minister Makhdoom Hashim Jawan Bakht. However, the anti-graft body neither responded to nor disposed of the plea, in violation of the law.
“This honourable court directed … respondent number one (Lt [retired] Gen Butt) to decide the pending application expeditiously within one month and strictly in accordance with law under intimation to DR (Judicial) of this honourable court vide order dated May 6,” the petition read.
“Neither the petitioner was summoned by the respondent nor [was] provided any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. Besides that, more than one month has lapsed, and the] petitioner has become [a] rolling stone at the hands of the respondents.”
The petition requested the court to summon the NAB chairman and read a charge under Article 204 (power to punish contempt of court) of the Constitution, in addition to other charges framed against him for failing to comply with the May 6 order.
The hearing
A two-member LHC bench, headed by Chief Justice Aalia Neelum, heard the contempt of court petition, where the petitioner argued that the anti-graft body did not follow the court order.
“I applied for NAB to probe [former federal minister for industries] Khusro Bakhtiar and Hashim Jawan Bakht’s unauthorised assets, but they did not decide on or respond to it, despite a court order,” he argued. “A court order against the chairman of the NAB should be made for contempt of court.”
When the Chief Justice asked who from NAB was present at the previous hearing, a government lawyer stated nobody was present. The court then ordered that Lt Gen (retired) Butt appear in court on September 15.

The new judicial year began in the IHC on Tuesday with Justice Dogar convening a full court meeting attended by all judges. Officials said the chief justice scheduled another full court session for 2pm today (Wednesday), issuing formal notices directing all IHC judges to attend.
Although the detailed agenda was not made public, such meetings are generally convened at the start of the judicial year to review the court’s performance, discuss administrative affairs, and set priorities for the coming months.
The full court meeting, to be chaired by Justice Dogar, will bring together all serving judges of the IHC for collective deliberations on judicial and administrative matters.
Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq also wrote a letter addressed to the IHC top judge, with copies sent to others, wherein he alleged that all his “brethren Judges have submissively reconciled to the concept of a Judiciary kowtowing to the executive”.
Sources said
the judges sought a revision of the full court’s agenda, expressing strong reservations about the IHC’s state of affairs and suggesting remedial measures. The letters were also shared with other judges.
Justice Sattar’s letter, seen by
Dawn.com
, said the full court meeting was “long overdue but welcome step towards correcting the illegalities that have seeped into the administration of Islamabad High Court”, pointing out that the process had begun during the term of the previous top judge.
“I am writing to you in request inclusion of the matters listed below for discussion in the full court meeting. I have only included here brief explanations or questions to articulate their relevance, but I am sure you’ll get my drift.
“Some might counsel that this is an exercise in futility in view of the egregious disregard for judicial independence, institutional norms and the principle of comity amongst judges that has been witnessed in our midst since your transfer to Islamabad High Court. But one must never lose hope in the innate capacity of human beings to assume control of their agency and do the right and decent thing,” Justice Sattar wrote.
IHC’s diminishing role as a guardian of fundamental rights
: Justice Sattar said the primary responsibility of the judiciary in a rule of law polity was to protect constitutionally-guaranteed fundamental rights against the abuse of power by the state.
He questioned whether IHC judges truly believed that the court was discharging that “pivotal constitutional duty” today and whether they believed that citizens perceived them as protectors and defenders of fundamental rights.
Failure to exercise supervision and control over subordinate judiciary
: On this issue, Justice Sattar asked if the IHC was discharging its obligation to supervise and control courts subordinate to it in a manner so that judges manning such courts could discharge their judicial functions without fear, as required by Article 203 of the Constitution.
“Should the Islamabad District judiciary continue to look like a game of musical chairs played predominantly by deputationists or does IHC have the responsibility to develop district judiciary as an independent institution possessed of integrity and efficiency?”
Lack of transparency and logic in fixation of cases and preparation of rosters
: About this issue, Justice Sattar said that as opposed to respecting institutional norms, Justice Dogar had created rosters excluding senior judges, including the senior puisne judge, from heading divisional benches.
“Should fixation of cases rest on the whims of the CJ or should there be transparency in who hears what case, while matching expertise of judges to the work they are asked to do? We write in our judgments every day that public officials aren’t kings and their administrative powers are neither unfettered nor should be exercised in a colorable manner. The cause lists issued under your watch reflect that cases are mostly marked to transferred judges and additional judges, leaving out permanent judges of IHC who found your transfer to IHC disagreeable. While exercising the administrative powers of IHC should one not remember that judges, including the CJ, are public officials too and not kings?”
Use of administrative powers to undermine judicial independence
: Justice Sattar lamented that under Justice Dogar’s leadership and watch, “we have seen the office refusing to issue cause lists in breach of judicial orders, we have seen cases being transferred from the docket of one court to another despite the lack of any power in the office of the CJ to do so, and most recently we have seen issuance of rosters to deprive two judges (including me) of their dockets in a move to render them dysfunctional vis-à-vis their single-bench dockets”.
The judge said that the above might be successful manoeuvres in “rendering some judges irrelevant” and the country’s judicial history was replete with “similar malevolent practices that spread during authoritarian times”. He, however, questioned whether such “subversion of judicial independence” was justifiable.
Composition of committees to undermine high court’s collegiate character
: On this issue, Justice Sattar said Justice Dogar had constituted committees “such that they exclude most of the senior judges of IHC from participating in its administrative functions.
“You’ve excluded the two senior-most judges of IHC from the Administration Committee in breach of IHC rules and entrenched institutional norms abided by all high courts, including the LHC from where you’ve come.
“Do you think manning IHC committees with additional judges appointed earlier this year and judges transferred from other provinces along with you strengthen IHC as an Institution and promote collegiality amongst judges?”
Assumption of powers to transform chief justice’s office into a monocracy
: The judge said the IHC chief justice had “assumed powers to issue a circular requiring judges to seek an NOC (no-objection certificate) from you to travel out of the country, essentially placing judges on the Exit Control List”.
Justice Sattar said neither the Constitution nor the law vested such rule-making power in the office of the chief justice to “lord over his peers”.
“The draft rules circulated for consideration during the full court meeting also seek to concentrate all administrative powers in the office of the chief justice. You might have read Lord Acton’s words that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Will transforming the office of chief justice into an autocracy, in an effort to reduce the judiciary to a regiment, bolster judicial independence essential for the discharge of our adjudicatory duties?” Justice Sattar pondered.
Performance evaluation of judges and reporting of judgments
: Regarding this issue, Justice Sattar said judges were the highest-paid public officials and should be strenuously held to account for their performance by the public.
However, he questioned whether there should not be an agreed objective framework for their performance evaluation.
“Under your watch IHC has issued skewed statistics regarding discharge of judicial work at IHC. These statistics are designed to cultivate an impression that some judges work super efficiently, while others don’t work at all. What if a curious researcher were to investigate the nature (and number) of cases marked to the ‘performing’ judges versus others, and the nature, quality and length of orders that make up their disposal figures? Should we not put together a consensual performance-evaluation criteria as well as guidance for which judgments are to be reported, to earnestly seek to enhance our performance and hold ourselves to account, instead of engaging in deceptive advertising?”
Concluding his letter, Justice Sattar said: “You will appreciate that it takes decades to build institutions, but they can be destroyed exponentially.  We have seen this happen to Islamabad High Court in the last couple of years.
“While I may be accused of letting hope trump experience in writing to you to encourage and facilitate intra-institutional debate to stem the rot that is reducing this judicial organ into nothingness, I am partial to Rousseau’s opinion regarding the capacity of human beings for virtue. History doesn’t remember kindly those who only make hay while the sun shines. And history also reminds us that all good (and bad) times come to an end sooner rather than later.”
Justice Sattar expressed hope that the IHC chief justice would read the letter to “appreciate the spirit in which it is written”.
He added: “I apologise in advance if the content causes any offence, for that is not the intent. We are all grown adults who should be able to speak candidly about the state of our institution’s disrepair. Without honest identification and admission of our failings, there can be no corrective action.”
It may be mentioned that Justice Sattar previously wrote letters to Justice Dogar on multiple issues, including amendments in the IHC Rules and formation of administrative committees, among others.
Judiciary kowtowing to the executive: Justice Ishaq
In his separate letter, an incomplete copy of which was seen by
Dawn.com
, Justice Ishaq alleged that his fellow judges had “submissively reconciled to the concept of a judiciary kowtowing to the executive”.
Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan of the Islamabad High Court. — IHC website/File
A “third” point in the letter mentioned “recent instructions by the office of the chief justice for the Judges to take NOC (no-objection certificate) from him for travel abroad”.
Justice Ishaq objected that it was “backed neither by any law nor by the common norms of CJ whether a judge spends his vacations in Pakistan or abroad”.
“This is a blatant impingement of the Fundamental Right of movement of a judge and, by extension, a below-the-belt strike on the independence of the judiciary. It is tantamount to a de facto placement of Judges on the
Exit Control List
. It is a mighty blow to the independence of the Judiciary.”
Justice Ishaq further noted: “There are orders passed by some judges of this court highlighting the clear distinction between the initial constitution of the benches and any later transfer of part-heard cases; the latter concept is beyond the pale of the ‘master of the roster’.
“A full and frank discussion (if it is allowed to take place) will necessitate that the Office be directed to annex with the Working Paper all judicial orders on this point passed by various judges of this court.”
The matter, Justice Ishaq said, “requires a frank discussion in the full court, for I am curious to know why my brethren judges have submissively reconciled to the concept of a judiciary kowtowing to the executive, regardless of the miscarriage of justice it can (and has already in some cases) resulted in, and which at least to me is tantamount to a perpetual violation of innumerable injunctions in the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of our beloved Prophet (PBUH) to do justice come what may, as also the oath of a judge under the Constitution to do justice without ‘fear, favour, or ill will’.”
He also took exception to the IHC Practice and Procedure Rules (PPR) being shared with the judges “only a day-and-a-half” before the full court meeting.
“I received yesterday the note for the full court meeting. Following the adage ‘better late than never’, I welcome this step, noting nonetheless that the full court meeting is an institutional convention to be followed each time any material decision impacting the functioning of the Islamabad High Court is to be taken, and not only when the idea catches the fancy of the IHC chief justice,” Justice Ishaq wrote.
He added that the notice was accompanied by a “voluminous compendium” of the new PPR, which apparently had already been notified in the official Gazette.
“I take strong exception to the PPR being shared with the Judges only a day-and-a-half before the full court meeting, as if we were possessed with some magical powers to read, analyse, and comment usefully on such a voluminous treatise that will regulate the functioning of the IHC and its subordinate judiciary.”
Justice Ishaq demanded a “proper presentation to the judges on the changes made to the existing framework under the Lahore High Court Rules adopted by the IHC”.
“As it stands now, it seems the full court meeting will only be a formality, or in any event devoid of any meaningful discussion on the PPR,” he said, adding that he was “unable to give any meaningful input on the PPR for being excluded during the process of their conception and drafting”.
Recently, the IHC chief justice constituted a division bench exclusively for clearing the backlog of nearly 2,000 tax references. Both Justice Sattar and Justice Ishaq are members of this special bench. The IHC administration had

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939625/pakistan-is-flooded-again-should-we-really-give-a-dam,Pakistan is flooded again. Should we really give a dam? - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Pakistan is flooded, again. A large part of Punjab is
under water
, while Sindh
braces for torrents
from the Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab to converge at the Panjnad — where all of the country’s five rivers unite — and move south. All of this has created a never-before-seen situation: three of Pakistan’s five rivers are in super floods, all at the same time.
Entire communities have been
displaced
, and millions of acres of farmland that sustain much of our economy are now in ruins. Disaster management authorities continue to issue
fresh warnings
after urban flooding overwhelmed major cities — from up north to down south — during the monsoon season.
The headlines are grim, the warnings frequent, and the patterns familiar. The reflex is familiar too: build more storage. But a dam-first playbook cannot carry a 21st-century river system through climate volatility, geopolitical shocks and decades of misaligned land use. We need to change the way we decide, before we decide what to build.
Here, we are less interested in winning an argument for or against dams and more interested in asking better questions before building one. And, the record already urges us to do so.
A systems lens
The season’s death toll has climbed, and tens of thousands have been told to move to higher ground as flood waves roll down the eastern rivers. If this year feels like déjà vu, it is. The
2010 super floods
affected around 20 million people. The
2022 deluge
caused roughly $30-$40 billion in economic losses. These were not freak events; they were warnings from a changing river system.
The changing climate makes this warning harder to ignore. As the
Hindu Kush–Himalaya warms
, studies project substantial glacier loss this century, even under lower-warming scenarios. The shift will alter when the Indus delivers water and how reliably it does so, which is the pattern much of our infrastructure was built around.
Downstream, the delta is already
straining
from less freshwater and less silt. Research and field reports document chronic shortfalls in environmental flows below Kotri and the steady advance of seawater. None of this is theoretical. It is visible on the coast, on farms, and in the lives of people who depend on the river reaching the sea.
This year’s floods have also arrived in a tense transboundary moment. India has
suspended participation
in the Indus Waters Treaty process, which adds uncertainty to how and when water information and releases move across the border. In moments like this, the argument returns almost by muscle memory: build more dams.
The instinct is understandable, but it is incomplete. If the aim is genuine security in water, food, power and livelihoods, the question is no longer simply about how much storage. It is about the kind of storage and its operation in a river system that is fast-changing.
A systems approach starts from that reality. A dam is never just a dam. It sits inside a moving network of rivers and glaciers, power grids and crop calendars, cities and ecosystems, budgets and borders. Change one piece and the whole machine responds. A systems lens does not mean no dams. It means testing choices against the system we actually have, not the averages we wish we still had.
A volatile Indus system
Pakistan will keep needing storage. The question is what kind, where, and with what operating rules, given climate physics, silt, winter dryness, power demand, crop calendars and downstream ecosystems. The Indus system is already volatile. In a single season, our reservoirs faced opposite problems.
After a dry winter, Mangla hit dead level and Tarbela hovered near it earlier in March, which cut hydropower and
squeezed irrigation releases
. By mid-July, Tarbela’s
spillways were opened
to pass flood peaks. One season, we cannot store enough. Next, we cannot release fast enough. This swing should make us pause before assuming that more of the same automatically buys security.
Layer onto this the retreat of the Himalayan ice. Even if total annual water holds for a time, the meltwater memory that steadies the shoulder seasons fades. More of the year’s water can arrive in shorter bursts. Storage planned around historical timing can sit underfilled in dry winters and overwhelmed in short, intense monsoons.
None of this is an argument against dams. It is an argument for widening the lens. A project that looks elegant in a single hydrology scenario can stumble in the real Pakistan, where
sediment rides the summer flood
and eats live storage, where
evaporation
quietly taxes open water in hotter summers, and where operating rules must juggle three competing goals: monsoon flood cushion, reliable Rabi releases and summer megawatts.
In a systems view, the task is to build a balanced storage portfolio with operating rules that can flex as conditions change.
Reading the notes
So where does that leave us in the middle of another unrelenting monsoon?
With a change in the order of operations. Start by accepting that the Indus basin today is defined by timing and variability. Then judge any new dam by whether it adds flexibility rather than rigidity, whether its design and operating rules can adapt when winters run dry, summers arrive in pulses, and diplomacy turns noisy.
Be honest about the downstream coast that needs freshwater to hold the line against salt. Keep investing in complementary ways of holding water, including off-channel storage and managed aquifer recharge, so big reservoirs are not asked to do every job alone. If we do that, the debate shifts from concrete as a reflex to concrete as part of a system. That is a conversation that, hopefully, our decision-makers are having.
None of this is as exciting as a groundbreaking ceremony. It is, however, more honest about what the river is telling us. We cannot outbuild volatility with one instrument. We can make the Indus steadier by matching decisions to its dynamics and by admitting that infrastructure and policy are part of the same machine. A systems lens is, at heart, humility in planning. Test projects as parts of a whole. Price their fragilities alongside their benefits. Prefer flexibility in an age when timing, not just totals, is shifting.
Pakistan can still build great things. But the river has been leaving us notes —
dead levels
in March and spillways in July, encroached floodplains
reclaimed
by the rivers, glaciers shedding their memory of winter. Reading these notes is not anti-development. It is the way development stands.",2025-09-04,Musab Waqar,1622,0.000182

anchorperson Imtiaz Mir in Karachi’s Malir area that injured him.
According to a statement issued by the Saudabad police station late last night, Mir was shot and injured by unknown gunmen in Malir district’s Kala Board area. “It seems to be targeted,” said the statement, adding that further investigation was under way.
CM Shah took notice of the “murderous attack on senior journalist Imtiaz Mir”, said a statement issued by the CM’s spokesperson, Abdur Rasheed Channa.
Expressing deep regret over the incident, the chief minister sought a report on the incident from Sindh Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon.
Saudabad Station House Officer (SHO) Atiqur Rehman told
Dawn.com
, “The journalist is admitted at the intensive care unit of [a] private hospital.”
He added that Mir sustained two bullet wounds, including one on the mouth. “He was travelling in a car, which his brother was driving, when armed pillion riders targeted him at Malir’s Kala Board,” SHO Rehman said.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, in a statement earlier today, condemned the attack and ordered the immediate arrest of the perpetrators. He also sought a report from the East district’s deputy IG.
“Protection of journalists and media workers should be ensured at all costs,” Lanjar was quoted as saying.
“Protection of the lives and property of citizens is the top priority of the government. The suspects should be brought to justice,” he asserted.
The police were also directed to reveal the motives behind the attack, the statement added.

surged through Lahore
in August 2025 after years of near-silence, it did more than flood plains and submerge roads; it reopened a chapter of the city’s soul long thought closed. For people who had grown up with the river as playground, lifeline, and legend, its sudden return was less catastrophe than reunion, a reminder that Lahore’s history is inseparable from the waters that once defined it.
Rooted in myths, epics and legends
From its earliest myths, Lahore has been inseparable from the Ravi. The river doesn’t just flow past the city — it flows through its memory and identity.
Foundational folklore locates the city’s origins in
Lava
or
Loh
, son of Rama and Sita, casting the river as both guardian and witness, flowing by the fort’s walls. In fact, Ravi’s banks were the stage for one of the earliest remembered battles: the
Dasarajna
, or Battle of Ten Kings.
In an
archival compilation on Lahore’s antiquities
, the
Deshwa Bhaga
— a traditional account naming Lahore as Lavpor or ‘City of Lava’ — reportedly speaks of a duel between the Raja of Lahore [ruler of the ancient Hindu principality of Lahore before its conquest] and the Pandava Bhim [a central heroic figure in the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata] at a forest by the Ravi’s edge. Punjabi ballads, too, place Lahore’s jungles, then called
Udinagar
, as the site where folk-hero Raja Rasalu slew a man-eating
rakshas
, casting the Ravi as a theatre of defiance and courage.
Together, these texts and oral traditions present Lahore not as a city beside a river but as a city forged through it: a civic identity built on epic landscapes of struggle and survival.
According to an
article
in
Dawn
, the Ravi, known in the Vedas [a body of religious scriptures originating in India] as
Iravati
, was part of
Saptasindu
, the land of seven rivers that defined the earliest cultural imagination of Punjab. The same piece recalls how the Battle of the Ten Kings, one of the most celebrated episodes of the
Rig Veda
(an ancient Sanskrit collection of hymns), was fought “on the banks of the River Ravi surrounding Lahore.” In that clash, King Bharata’s tribe defeated a powerful confederation of rulers.
Thus, from the very outset of South Asia’s mythic consciousness, Lahore and the Ravi are intertwined: the city emerges not just as a settlement on water but as a battlefield, a site of identity forged through conflict and survival.
This cultural symbolism extended into Lahore’s religious imagination. The 16th-century mystic Shah Hussain, better known as Madho Lal Hussain, was first buried on the Ravi’s bank. When the river flooded, his grave was swept to higher ground near Shalimar, far from the current river course, an act his devotees interpreted as the Ravi’s own homage, carrying its lover to safety. Lahore’s famous
Mela Chiraghan
(‘Festival of Lights’) grew up around this shrine, once involving lamps floated on the Ravi’s waters in his memory. Through this story, the Ravi itself becomes a character in Lahore’s Sufi history — a vehicle of divine will and protector of saints.
In Sikh tradition, Ravi and Lahore are immortalised as a site of martyrdom and faith. It was along the fort’s Ravi-wall in 1606 that the 5th Sikh Guru, Arjan Dev,
met his end.
Sikh scriptures recount that after days of torture in Lahore, Guru Arjan was permitted to bathe in the Ravi, which then flowed just outside the city walls. According to legend, Guru Arjan’s soul merged with the Ravi’s waters — a serene acceptance of God’s will.
This poignant event is commemorated at Gurdwara Dera Sahib in Lahore (on the old Ravi bank), and the river itself is revered as a witness to the Guru’s sacrifice.
These are not idle fictions, rather collective myths: narratives through which communities stabilise identity and transmit values across generations. For Lahoris, the Ravi functioned as a symbolic reservoir, embodying both beauty and defiance, and each retelling on the bridges or in the gardens reinforced their social frameworks of memory. In this way, folklore was less about individual imagination and more about a shared cultural memory that allowed the city to see itself reflected in the river, century after century.
That inheritance began to fade as the river itself receded. By the late 20th century, upstream diversions and unchecked pollution left the Ravi a blackened trickle. Experts
noted
a 36pc decline in annual flow and more than 40pc in summer months, transforming what was once a gold-bearing artery of Punjab into an open sewer.
For Lahoris, the sight of a dry bed beneath the bridges was more than ecological loss; it was cultural bereavement. A city once defined by its river was left with nothing but dust and memory.
The reunion of August 2025
This August, unprecedented
monsoon rains
and dam releases forced the
Ravi back into Lahore
. Alongside the Sutlej and Chenab, it produced one of the largest floods in Punjab’s history, displacing
over two million people
. Yet amid danger, Lahoris flocked to the bridges not in fear but in awe. Families gathered to watch the river swell, stretched their hands towards the water, and the two long-lost lovers had met again.
So what does it mean when a community celebrates the very flood that endangers it? The answer lies not in irrationality but in collective memory.
In Lahore, the Ravi has long functioned as what sociologist Maurice Halbwachs might call a “social framework of memory” — a living symbol through which people situate themselves in history and culture. The river is not merely water; it is a repository of myth, identity, and continuity. Its disappearance hollowed out not only Lahore’s landscape but also its cultural self-understanding. Its sudden return, how ever destructive, activated what French historian Pierre Nora describes as a
lieu de mémoire
: a site where memory condenses, reviving an ancient rhythm in the civic imagination.
Yet nostalgia must be distinguished from material conditions. The flood did not simply return romance to the city; it also exposed the structural vulnerabilities of Lahore’s urban planning, the weakness of its embankments, and the absence of a coherent ecological strategy. Schemes like the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project as well as the myriad of other real estate projects dotting the riverbanks are framed as progress, but without critical attention to ecology and equity, they risk repeating the very extractive logic that once killed the river.
The paradox
When Lahore expanded toward the Ravi, it wasn’t simply a cartographic shift; it was an urban philosophy that treated a living floodplain as a real estate frontier. For some Lahoris, this August’s flood was a moment of dread as their homes swept away, their lives upended. For others, it was a bittersweet reunion with a river they had long cherished as memory. Yet what returned was not nostalgia alone but the Ravi itself, in its own course, at its own speed, with the force of disaster. And the truth that must be faced is this: it is not only the river that has returned to its place, but human construction that has trespassed into it now stands exposed and precariously at risk.
Entire swathes of land, formerly declared “prone to floods” by the Punjab Irrigation Department are now
filled with private housing schemes,
many of which have seen considerable damage in the recent floods. Supported by regulators applying rules unevenly and even approving projects inside the flood-influence zone, many of these housing schemes are located in the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project. The irony here is that the “river training works” and construction of flood protection embankments, which were supposed to be carried out by the Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda), lagged far behind in approvals.
Moreover, the Human Rights Watch too
reported
that the scheme spans over 100,000 acres, with around 85pc of the land under cultivation before its acquisition. At the time, the HRW documented how farmers were pressured off their land even as environmental groups warned of the risks posed by the channelisation and paving of the floodplain.
Together, these findings expose how Lahore’s expansion into the Ravi was less development than denial; a refusal to respect the ecological logic of the river, and a gamble that was always going to end up in catastrophe.
Today, the river’s return denotes the paradox of affective attachment in contexts of risk: people are drawn to it because it anchors identity, even as it threatens material survival. Lahoris are interpreting the river both as symbol of who they are and as hazard to what they have built.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939778,Talk of ‘hybrid system’ admission of dictatorship: Justice Minallah - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: Expressing his
disappointment
with Pakistan’s judicial history since independence, Supreme Court Justice Athar Min­allah on Thursday said that
talk
of a “hybrid system” in the country actually amou­nted to an admission to the presence of a dictatorship.
Speaking to the Karachi Bar Association (KBA), the SC judge observed that the only way forward is through the Constitution, adding that every authority had taken an oath to abide by it.
He argued that the foundation of the Constitution is the people’s right to rule, and set out a simple test: “No institution or government officer should engage in political engineering. Public representatives must come through free and fair elections. But till today this has only remained our dream.”
In a post on his X account, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — who had famously spoken about the ‘hybrid system’ in glowing terms — responded to the Supreme Court judge’s remarks later in the day.
Praises those who stuck to their principles despite all odds; says judges ‘allowed themselves to be used’ in Z.A. Bhutto case
Asif pointed out that Mr Minallah had himself served as a provincial minister in the former NWFP government under Gen Musharraf, saying that this was also a “declared martial law”, and called for self-reflection.
It should be recalled that subsequently, Mr Minallah became one of the leading figures of the lawyers’ movement for the restoration of the judiciary.
In his remarks at ‘Independence of the Judiciary, Constitutional Governance and Access to Justice: The Way Forward’, a seminar held at the City Courts, Justice Minallah lamented the judiciary’s past failures, while praising those who upheld principles, even at great personal cost.
He singled out as his heroes five judges of the then-Sindh Chief Court who, in the landmark Maulvi Tamizuddin case, moved to restore the country’s first Constituent Assembly after it was dissolved in 1954 by governor-general Ghulam Muhammad.
“Had those five judges been taken as role models, and had that decision been upheld by the Federal Court at the time, Pakistan would not have seen 77 years of dictatorship; instead, the rule of law would have prevailed,” Justice Minallah said, lamenting that today “people hesitate even to name those judges as their role models”.
The Sindh Chief Court’s decision in favour of Maulvi Tamizuddin — the assembly’s speaker — was eventually overturned on technical grounds by the Federal Court.
Justice Minallah linked that early  precedent to subsequent episodes in which courts, in his view, failed to stand firm.
Musharraf vs SC judges
He recalled that when Gen Pervez Mus­harraf suspended the Constitution in 1999 and issued a Provisional Constitutional Order, some Supr­eme Court judges refused to take fresh oath.
“Out of those six judges, five belonged to Sindh,” he said. “Some were in line to become chief justice, but they made a principled decision in light of their oath.”
His remarks come amid strains within the Islam­abad High Court, where judges are split over the new Establ­ishment (Ap­­­p­­ointment and Con­ditions of Service) Rules, 2025. Despite resistance from senior judges, the rules were approved by a narrow majority, while a bid by Justices Babar Sattar and Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan to alter the meeting’s agenda was vetoed.
“The 77-year judicial history is not a matter of pride for me,” the judge told the audience, adding that his leaders were those who led the lawyers’ movement,” referring to the nationwide mobilisation that followed the 2007 sacking of the chief justice by Musharraf.
“For the past 77 years, there has been no constitutional governance here,” he said. “In many of my high court judgements, I wrote that there is no rule of law.”
Revisiting Bhutto’s trial
Justice Minallah also revisited one of Pakistan’s most contentious judicial episodes: the 1979 execution of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
Referring to an interview by General Ziaul Haq, Justice Minallah said the army chief was asked whether judges would be under pressure during the trial of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He added that the general replied, “No, that is not the case.” However, Justice Minallah said those very judges later admitted that they had “sent him to the gallows under pressure.”
“But even after 40 years, though the Supreme Court admitted it, no one was held accountable,” he said.
He further said that in the entire episode, judges were used because they willingly allowed themselves to be used. “Yet even then, three judges dissented,” two of whom belonged to this bar, he said, including Justice Dorab Patel.
Senior lawyer Munir A. Malik, who also spoke at the event, noted that he had the chance to share a platform with Justice Minallah after 18 years.
“I consider Athar Minallah and some judges from Islamabad as an endangered species,” he said, tongue-in-cheek.

“The prime minister will also participate in a meeting of select Islamic leaders with US President Trump to exchange views on issues pertaining to regional and international peace and security,” a statement issued by the FO said.
The meeting of Muslim leaders with Trump could be the first instance of PM Shehbaz directly interacting with the US president since the latter assumed the top office in his country in January. Earlier, he
met
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal General Syed Asim Munir in June, marking the first time a US president has hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House unaccompanied by senior civilian officials.
On his visit to New York, the PM would be leading Pakistan’s delegation to the “high-level segment” of the UNGA from 22 September 2025, the FO said, adding that he would be accompanied by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other ministers and senior officials.
At the UNGA session, PM Shehbaz “will urge the international community to resolve the situations of prolonged occupation and denial of the right to self-determination,” particularly in India-occupied Kashmir and Palestine.
“He will draw attention of the international community towards the grave crisis in Gaza and call for decisive action to end the suffering of the Palestinian people,” the FO stated.
“He will also highlight Pakistan’s perspective on the regional security situation, as well as other issues of international concern, including climate change, terrorism, Islamophobia, and sustainable development.”
The FO, in its statement, said PM Shehbaz would attend several “high-level events” on the sidelines of the UNGA session, including important meetings of the UN Security Council, a high-level Meeting of the Global Development Initiative (GDI), and a special high-level event on Climate Action, among others.
Further, during his visit, he will meet several world leaders and senior UN officials to exchange views on issues of mutual interest.
“He will also underline Pakistan’s resolve to work with all UN member states to uphold the UN Charter, prevent conflict, foster peace and promote global prosperity in Pakistan’s current role as a member of the Security Council,” the FO added.
FO highlighted that the PM’s participation in “this biggest annual gathering of global leaders” would showcase Pakistan’s “strong commitment to multilateralism and the United Nations”. It would also reaffirm “Pakistan’s longstanding contribution towards the shared objectives of peace and development,” it said.
Trump’s upcoming meeting with Muslim leaders, including PM Shehbaz, follows significant developments in the Middle East.
Earlier this month, Israel, a US ally,
targeted
top Hamas officials in Doha, Qatar, killing five of the group’s members and a Qatari security officer.
The attack drew widespread international condemnation, including from Gulf monarchies allied with the United States, which is also an ally of Qatar.
Subsequently, Arab and Muslim leaders called for a
review
of ties with Israel at an emergency Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation joint session held in the Qatari capital. The event was co-sponsored by Pakistan. A joint
statement
from the summit also urged “all states to take all possible legal and effective measures to prevent Israel from continuing its actions against the Palestinian people”.
For his part, Trump — who had a dinner with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in New York following the Israeli attack in Qatar — made careful remarks before the Arab gathering as Washington’s two powerful Middle Eastern allies faced a worsening rift.
The US president had initially rebuked Israel over the attack, saying he was “very unhappy” about it. However, later US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was “not going to change the nature of our relationship with the Israelis”.
Some analysts are of the
view
that Israeli aggression against Qatar has cast a shadow on US credibility in the Middle East as Arab nations look elsewhere for protection from Israel.

to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
In a press release, the ISPR said security forces conducted the IBO on the night of 14/15 September on the “reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan”.
“During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the military’s media wing added.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” the ISPR noted.
Sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, according to the ISPR.
“Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the military reaffirmed.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943756/cda-fails-to-prevent-sandaymar-dams-sewage-contamination,CDA fails to prevent Sandaymar Dam’s sewage contamination - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: Despite conducting a survey of the Punjab government’s small dam in Dhoke Sandaymar, Sector D-17, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has so far failed to prevent contamination of the dam’s water, which has virtually turned into sludge due to the mixing of sewage from unregulated housing schemes nearby.
Recently, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed a task force to protect small dams within the vicinity of the federal capital from contamination.
However, residents of Dhoke Sandaymar have received no relief regarding the protection of Sandaymar Dam.
“The dam has turned into sludge with a green layer on it and a stinking smell all around. This has made life in the nearby neighbourhood miserable,” said Akhtar Shah, a resident of Dhoke Sandaymar.
Despite PM’s task force, water reservoir in Sector D-17 has turned into sludge, posing risks to residents and environment
An aerial survey conducted by the Punjab government a few years ago showed that large drains originating from Tarnol, some five kilometres away, along with sewage from two main housing societies, flow into the dam’s water.
“A couple of years ago there was a large quantity of fish in the dam and it was auctioned every two years to private contractors, who caught and sold the fish in the market. However, now there is no fish in the dam as its water has become badly polluted,” said Asad Abbas, another resident.
The dam, located in Sector D-17 about four kilometres from Sangjani, was built by the Punjab government in the mid-1990s primarily to supply water for irrigation. It also supported fish farming.
It has been learnt that not only Sandaymar Dam, but other dams in the jurisdiction of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, including Rawal Dam, are also being contaminated due to the mixing of sewage, adversely affecting people, flora, and fauna in both cities.
Following reports of contamination in Dhoke Sandaymar Dam, the Punjab Small Dams Organisation (SDO) wrote to the CDA chairman, complaining about the civic agency’s failure to protect the reservoir.
The SDO Circle-I Islamabad project director, in a letter to the CDA chief, highlighted the issue.
“Besides direct benefits like irrigation and fish production, the water pond also contributes to underground aquifer recharge in the area,” the letter read.
The catchment area of the dam extends up to Tarnol with several localities in between.
“It has been observed that untreated sewage and wastewater from these settlements is discharged into the natural drains,” the letter stated, adding that “this untreated water is contaminating the lake, making it unsuitable for irrigation as well as unhealthy for any kind of aquaculture.”
The letter further identified Tarnol, Moosa Town, Iqra Colony, Saifia Town, Pind Parian village, Ratti Kassi, Ittefaq Colony, Mohalla Farooq-i-Azam (Sarai Kharbooza), Cabinet Division Employees Cooperative Housing Society (sectors E-16, E-17) and Roshan Pakistan Cooperative Housing Society, E-16, as major contributors to the contamination.
The project director requested strict action under prevailing bylaws and environmental regulations to stop the entry of contaminated water from these settlements.
“An immediate and effective action will not only preserve the natural beauty of the lake but will also safeguard the well-being of all who depend on it.”
The matter has also been raised with the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency’s director general.
On the other hand, the CDA said in compliance with directives of the PM’s task force, the authority had conducted a preliminary survey of the area surrounding Sandaymar Dam. Localities contributing to contamination have been identified and mapped through satellite imagery.
It added that since the vicinity of Sandaymar Dam comprises both planned and unplanned settlements, various technical and logistical options were being explored for the effective collection and treatment of raw sewage, while taking into account site constraints and environmental sensitivities.
To develop a comprehensive and sustainable solution, the CDA said it had engaged qualified consultants to assess viable interventions and design sewage treatment infrastructure.

serial rapist
before a judicial magistrate while recording their statements on Thursday.
Investigating officer (IO) Muhammad Sajjad produced the suspect before Judicial Magistrate (South) Kalsoom Mustafa Sahto, while the survivor girls also appeared before the court to record their statements.
According to the prosecution, the four victims identified the suspected rapist before the magistrate while recording their statements under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
The victim girls stated that the suspect had lured them to his house, where he subjected them to a sexual assault, it added.
The statements were recorded in the judge’s chamber in both written and video form, in the presence of the state prosecutor, the suspect and the complainant’s counsel.
The prosecution added that out of the six FIRs registered against the suspect for rape, statements from the survivors have been recorded in only three cases so far.
The victim girls were produced before the judge one by one, and each narrated their ordeal. Among them was the victim who had taken a USB from the suspect’s house which contained over a hundred explicit videos.
She took that USB to a video shop for the purpose of downloading music onto it, but the shop owner detected the presence of explicit content on the drive and informed area residents, who apprehended the suspect and beat him up before handing him over to the police.
The prosecution claimed that the videos have been sent to Punjab for forensic examination, while the suspect is in police custody till Sept 19 for further interrogation.
At least six separate cases have been registered at the Defence police station under Sections 376 (iii) and 377 of the Pakistan Penal Code, while another FIR was lodged on the complaint of the state against the suspect under Section 11/3 of the Sindh Information of Temporary Residents Act.
The police said that the suspect had been residing in a rented house without any tenancy agreement, which constituted an offence under the Act.

“Let it be clear once again: we are not running a campaign against any ideology or institution, but for the bona fide rights of our people that have been denied for over seven decades under one or the other pretext,” he told a cheering crowd in Plate.
Traders vow to keep shops open
“The lockdown will send a loud and clear message that enough is enough. Either grant the rights or face the wrath of the people.”
He said the lockdown was plan A, while the alliance had also prepared plans B and C. “And plan D,” he warned, “is the harshest.”
While the government has not publicly outlined its strategy for the Sept 29 event, officials said strict security measures have been established.
On Saturday, large convoys of vehicles carrying armed police and paramilitary personnel conducted flag marches in almost all district headquarters. Heavy contingents were also deployed at city entry and exit points, with strict surveillance at sensitive sites.
Separately, traders’ associations announced they would forgo their  weekly holiday and keep shops open on Sunday to allow citizens to  purchase essential food and household items ahead of the planned  lockdown.
At the Muzaffarabad  meeting, Divisional Commissioner Chaudhry Guftar Hussain noted that  federal and AJK ministers had already held “open-hearted” dialogue with  the JKJAAC but stressed that peace must be ensured collectively.  “Disorder and lawlessness benefit no one,” he remarked.
District  Magistrate Mudasser Farooq, speaking at the same meeting, warned that no  one would be allowed to disrupt public life or free movement.
“Maintaining  peace is a shared responsibility of the administration, police, and  citizens,” he said. “We have no quarrel with anyone, but our mission of  public service will continue at all costs.” He added that safeguarding state property, including vehicles and machinery, was the “foremost duty of all employees.”

As per police sources, Qari Abdul Hafeez, a resident of Jalawali village, a Quran teacher at a local madressah, had filed a complaint, saying that on Sept 15, his four-year-old daughter, Afifa Kainat, left home after Maghrib prayers to buy sweets, but did not return home.
He said that he and other locals looked for the girl on their own and also made announcements in local mosques about her disappearance, but to no avail. He said he later lodged a complaint with Qila Kalerwala police, which registered a kidnap FIR against unknown person(s) on his complaint under section 363 of PPC.
Sialkot district police spokesperson says DPO Faisal Shahzad formed teams headed by Pasrur DSP to recover the girl and arrest her abductor. He said three days later, the police were informed about a girl’s body lying in the fields.
He said that a police team reached the spot and identified the body as that of missing Afifa.
According to police, the body was swollen because it had been left in water in the fields.
The police teams recorded the evidence and eyewitness statements, while the forensic team collected samples from the spot and sent them to the laboratory.
The body’s postmortem examination in Pasrur THQ Hospital revealed that the girl was sexually assaulted before murder.
The DPO says the investigators are using human intelligence sources and modern technology to arrest the culprit.
Meanwhile, the victim’s family and other area residents protested against the police for failing to recover the girl alive. They said if the police had made timely efforts to recover the girl, she would have been alive.
They appealed to the chief minister to take action against the police officials concerned for showing negligence and laziness in recovering the girl alive.

sitting
on Aug 22.
The agenda relates to framing
rules
for the judicial performance evaluation of judges of all high courts and suggesting criteria for the elevation of judges to the superior judiciary.
Although the rules are yet to be framed, the
26th Constitution Amendment
had amended Article 175A of the Constitution, emphasising that if the performance of a high court judge was found lacking or inefficient, the JCP would grant the judge a certain period for improvement, as deemed appropriate.
If, after the completion of this period, the judge’s performance was still found to be inefficient, the commission would send its report to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) with a recommendation for removal.
The amendment also requires the commission to conduct an annual performance evaluation of high court judges. It further empowers the commission to make separate rules to establish effective standards for such evaluations.
Similarly, the 26th Amendment amended Article 177, which now stipulates that no one may be elevated as a judge of the Supreme Court unless he is a citizen of Pakistan and has either served as a judge of a high court for at least five years or has practiced as an advocate of a high court for not less than 15 years and is also an advocate of the Supreme Court.
On June 19, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi constituted a broad-based committee on judicial performance evaluation of high court judges. The body includes members from the judiciary, parliament, executive and the legal fraternity. It was tasked with preparing draft rules for annual judicial performance evaluations and developing criteria for the selection of judges in the superior courts.
At its last meeting, the committee had deferred the agenda of framing rules for regulating judicial performance evaluations, though it acknowledged that Article 175A(4) of the Constitution empowers it to develop such rules. The matter will now be taken up again in the near future.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942804/senate-panel-alarmed-by-reports-dam-water-unfit-for-consumption,Senate panel alarmed by reports dam water unfit for consumption - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: A Senate committee on Wednesday expressed serious concern over reports showing water in Rawal Dam is entirely unsafe for drinking while 62 per cent of water in Simli Dam has become unfit for human consumption.
The revelation was made during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change, headed by Senator Sherry Rehman, to review troubling findings on Rawal and Simli dams.
A Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources study showed that 62 per cent of water supplied after filtration was unsafe for drinking, while Rawal Dam water was 100pc unsafe for human consumption.
Despite orders of the Supreme Court, sewage contamination persisted in the water. Senator Rehman criticised attempts to hide the data, saying: “When surface water was unsafe at source, filtration becomes meaningless. We are here to audit your work, not to stay silent.”
Sherry urges govt to immediately extend BISP aid to flood-hit families
The report covered July-August 2025 period. The Supreme Court had earlier directed the Punjab government to act immediately on sewage contamination in Rawal dam, but the action was not taken, the meeting observed.
Senator Rehman demanded that transparency be ensured in water quality reporting and urgent steps should be taken to make Rawal and Simly dams safe from contamination.
“Pakistan is facing climate catastrophes every year. Relief must not be delayed, governance cannot remain this slow, and resources cannot be consumed by administration instead of frontline action. Whether it is flood relief, glacial melt, or drinking water safety, we need urgent course correction now,” she said.
Discussing the
recent floods
, she urged the government to immediately extend Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) aid to nearly three million flood-affected families across the country.
“Delays in financial transfers are causing misery among three million people. Instead of new mini-budgets, the country should mobilise international support, just as it did in 2022,” Senator Rehman said. The committee endorsed her recommendation.
The committee also directed authorities to map the country’s waterways, identify blockages along the Indus River and its tributaries, and explore affordable water storage solutions. Members of the committee expressed concern over “faulty forecasts” of the Pakistan Meteorological Department.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) told the committee that 998 people were killed and 1,062 injured in the recent floods, with three million affected in Punjab alone. Nearly 300,000 displaced people were living in tents, while 2,000 relief camps were active nationwide.
Senator Rehman directed officials concerned to share detailed data of affected people and improve relief camp standards and ensure proper water, electricity and health services in these camps.
Turning to GLOF-II project, she criticised delays, noting that only 15pc of its budget had been spent on early warning systems since 2017, while 30 per cent went to administrative costs.

Officials told this scribe that Charsadda accounted for more than 65 per cent of cases recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the current year. The department has asked medical entomologists in Mardan, Chitral Lower, Dir Lower and Torghar districts to report to district health officer of Charsadda where the outbreak of the vector-borne disease continues.
According to the directorate of vector-borne disease at directorate general health services Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the outbreak in Charsadda started in August when it recorded 714 patients, mostly from two union councils where authorities deployed lady health workers and healthcare workers to cope with the situation.
The whole province has 57 hospitalisations due to dengue. Patients have been admitted to district headquarters hospital Charsadda. They have been kept in a specially established isolated ward. Of the total infected persons, 661 have already recovered and sent home.
Two union councils of the district have been hit hard by the disease
Officials said they dispatched impregnated bed nets to Charsadda district that were distributed among the people of the infected union councils. They said that they launched awareness campaign to inform people about causative agents of the mosquitoes-borne ailment.
They said that health department in collaboration with line departments was working to eliminate pools of stagnant water in the endemic areas and deny sanctuaries to mosquitoes. They said that standing water in localities as well as in uncovered water-carrying pots inside homes were the main reason of breeding sites of mosquitoes, the carriers and transmitters of the disease.
Officials said that the 11 flood-affected districts were safe from the disease and enough equality of bed nets and insecticidal spray were sent to Buner, Swabi and other districts to put brakes on dengue. The department has mobilised its staff to scale up awareness campaign and enable people to escape mosquito-bites, not to only stay safe from dengue but also from malaria and leishmaniasis.
Other worst-hit districts by dengue are Haripur with 93 cases, Mansehra 71 cases, Swabi 43 cases, Peshawar 41 cases, Kohat 36 cases, Abbottabad 32 cases, Nowshera 22 cases, Buner 17 cases, Swat 15 and Bajaur 11 cases.
The disease is widespread but the rest of the districts hadn’t reported many cases and situation remained under control, officials said.
According to them, district headquarters hospitals across the province have established isolation wards on the directives of the director-general health services, Dr Shahid Yunis, and advisory regarding diagnosis and management of cases had also been shared with the relevant officials at district and tehsil level.
A report released by Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response System (IDSRS) of public health section at directorate general health services said that flood-hit districts had so far recorded 70,981 patients including 2,229 during the last 24 hours.
They suffer from communicable diseases. A total of 339 deaths have been documented in 11 districts so far while the tally of injured people is 357.
The number of water and food-borne and eye-related diseases has been on the downtrend with fewer cases of snake and dog bites, according to the report.
It said that people were also being examined in health facilities while medical camps were set up in those areas where hospitals had been damaged by floods. The department established 468 camps so far, it added.

With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.
Balochistan Health Department and Quetta Civil Hospital spokesperson Dr Waseem Baig told
Dawn.com
: “Three people were injured in the blast and have been shifted to the Civil Hospital Trauma Centre, while an injured child has been taken to Combined Military Hospital.”
Muhammad Kashif, Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division public relations officer, told
Dawn.com
that a railway track was blown up with explosives in the town of Spezand, derailing six bogies.
“The train was coming from Peshawar to Quetta and there were 270 passengers on board,” he said, adding that a relief train was dispatched from Quetta after the explosion, while a team of officers, rescue trucks and private cranes was also rushed to the spot for relief operations.
He said the work of repairing the railway track and removing the bogies would begin in daylight tomorrow, while an investigation into the incident was launched.
Kashif said security forces had cordoned off the area and launched a search operation.
A
similar incident
occurred last month when six bogies were derailed near the same location.
That incident had come just three days after a Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.
In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, damaging a bogie of the Bolan Mail.
A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh’s Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion — even by government-run media — but the Ministry of Railways later said a technical fault was the cause.
In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to derail in Jacobabad. No one was hurt in the incident.
In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was stopped at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.
Train services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were restored on March 27, after they were suspended due to the unprecedented hijacking of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.
The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.",2025-09-23,Abdullah Zehri,709,0.000113
https://www.dawn.com/news/1939898/the-pain-that-isnt-scanned-why-is-mental-health-missing-in-cancer-care,The pain that isn’t scanned — Why is mental health missing in cancer care? - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"At just 40, Farhat had never imagined her world would shrink to hospital corridors, infusion drips, and the sterile hush of oncology wards. A spirited schoolteacher from Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Karachi, she was known for her laughter — loud, contagious, and always a beat ahead of the room.
But after her breast cancer diagnosis, the laughter disappeared. What followed was not just the slow unraveling of her physical health, but a silent, suffocating assault on her emotional wellbeing.
Sara, another breast cancer patient, endured mastectomy, chemotherapy, and the disorienting fog of fatigue and pain. But the darkest moments weren’t marked by physical suffering; they came in the long, sleepless nights filled with fear, anxiety, and an overwhelming sense of isolation. “Everyone talks about surviving cancer,” she whispered, “but no one prepares you for surviving yourself.”
Like countless women in Pakistan, these women found themselves trapped in a blind spot of our healthcare system: psychological support.
Farhat was recommended therapy, yes — but each session cost more than her monthly utility bills, and the nearest affordable counselling centre was two crowded bus rides and a month-long waitlist away. Her oncologist had done all he could for her body, but for her mind, there was nothing.
In a country where mental health is still spoken of in hushed tones and emotional pain is dismissed as weakness, her suffering went largely unseen. Even her family, loving but bewildered, urged her to pray harder, stay positive, and avoid “overthinking.” But what happens when the mind itself becomes a battlefield no prayer alone can soothe?
Their stories are not rare. And it forces us to ask: are we truly treating cancer or only the parts of it we can see?
The missing half of cancer care
Globally, the prevalence of anxiety and depression is 30 per cent and 33pc, respectively,
according
to an umbrella review carried out by Addisu et al. Some researches show the percentages to be even higher.
A Karachi-based
study
of 402 breast cancer patients found 59.7pc suffered anxiety, 69.4pc depression, and 47.5pc reported suicidal ideation. That said, what are the options a cancer patient has? A handful of psychotherapy centres exist, but most operate privately, and for the average patient, the cost of care remains far beyond reach.
Integrating mental health care into oncology remains one of the field’s greatest challenges. Despite the overwhelming prevalence of psychological distress, many cancer patients are left with unmet mental health needs.
The reasons are layered: limited time for distress screening, inadequate training of healthcare professionals, and insufficient resources to follow through when mental health concerns are identified. What is crucial to note here is that mental health support is often delivered separately from cancer treatment, leading to a disjointed and fragmented approach that leaves patients to piece together their own care.
We don’t have to look far for examples. In Sri Lanka, psychotherapy is being
woven into
cancer care, with the Ministry of Health recognising psychological support for patients and survivors as essential. Survivorship care, including counselling, has been
formally built
into the country’s National Strategic Plan for Cancer Prevention and Control.
Alongside this, Sri Lanka is
strengthening
palliative care services that incorporate psychosocial support, while also exploring ways to integrate complementary medicine with conventional cancer treatment.
Emotional healing has a price tag
This vision of holistic care stands in sharp contrast to Pakistan, where the prohibitive cost of therapy alone keeps psychological support out of reach for most patients.
A single session with a qualified therapist in Karachi can range from Rs3,000 to Rs8,000 — an amount far beyond what many middle income families can afford, especially when they’re already struggling to pay for diagnostic tests, medications, chemotherapy or even surgery. Unlike physical treatments, therapy is rarely a one-time intervention. It is ongoing, often requiring weekly or biweekly sessions — costs that quickly multiply into an overwhelming financial burden.
Yes, there are peer-led support groups in Pakistan that provide emotional comfort through shared stories, mutual encouragement, and a sense of community. However, they are not a substitute for professional mental health care.
Psychotherapy, especially when delivered by psychologists experienced in trauma and chronic illness, offers evidence-based interventions tailored to each patient’s psychological needs. It can address clinical depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and adjustment disorders, issues that often go beyond the scope of peer support.
Treating the body and the mind
It is time for Pakistan’s healthcare system to recognise that cancer treatment cannot stop at surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Emotional wellbeing must be treated as an essential part of recovery, not an afterthought. Psychological screening and counselling need to be built into routine oncology care, particularly in public hospitals where most patients turn for treatment.
Provincial governments must invest in training psycho-oncology professionals, subsidise mental health services for cancer patients, and expand teletherapy to bridge the urban–rural divide. At the same time, civil society and health institutions must lead awareness efforts so that emotional suffering is no longer dismissed as weakness, but understood as a valid, treatable consequence of illness.
Because in the fight against cancer, emotional wellbeing is not a luxury, it is survival.
Training oncology staff to recognise depression in cancer patients is crucial for improving both care and outcomes. Simple tools like the
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)
can be used in clinical settings to screen patients and ensure no one slips through unnoticed.
Farhat survived the surgeries, the chemotherapy, the physical pain, but the emotional wounds lingered, unspoken and untreated. And her story is far from unique. Across Pakistan, countless patients endure the same silent suffering, their mental health sacrificed in a system that sees only the tumour, not the trauma.
Until cancer is treated as a disease of both body and mind, true healing will remain out of reach. It is not enough to save lives; we must fight to save what makes them worth living.

Local residents immediately rushed to the spot and managed to put out the fire after several hours of effort as no firefighting arrangements were available in the area at that time.
Witnesses said valuable goods, furniture, and other items worth millions of rupees were reduced to ashes. The incident caused a severe financial setback to the affected traders, many of whom depended solely on their shops for livelihood.
Residents complained that the absence of firefighting facilities in Dog Dara and nearby areas forced them to battle the flames with limited resources. They demanded the government establish a fire brigade system in Sheringal and other remote areas to prevent similar losses in the future.
Police said the exact cause of the fire could not be immediately determined. An investigation has been launched.
DPO VISITS CHECKPOSTS: The newly-posted Lower Dir district police officer Taimur Khan visited Zaimdara police station on Monday.
He inspected the daily diary record, armoury, storehouse, lockups, residential barracks, and investigation files at the police station.
Later, the DPO visited Kalpani checkpost, Gal and Suri Pao police posts, where he met with the officials and examined security arrangements. He inspected the CCTV cameras, and instructed the policemen to further tighten and streamline security checks to monitor suspicious individuals and vehicles effectively.
He directed policemen to treat citizens with courtesy, resolve their issues on priority, and turn police stations and checkposts into facilitation centres for the public.
RECOVERED:
A car stolen from Malakabad, Balambat in Lower Dir on Sept 22, was recovered four days later in Swat after police tracked it through CCTV footage from multiple locations.
Investigation officer Tariq Amin examined camera footages from Balambat, Timergara, and along the Chakdara-Shamozo Road. The car was traced to Mingora, where it was last seen taking a U-turn in Rahimabad area.
After an extensive search of parking lots and vacant plots, the vehicle was finally recovered from an empty plot on Monday. Police said the suspects had been arrested and further investigation was under way.

chair
of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s Reg­ional Anti-Terrorist Structure (SCO-RATS).
“Pakistan today assumed the chair of the Shanghai Coope­ra­tion Organisation’s Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure for 2025-26,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a
statement
after the 44th meeting of the RATS council in Cholpon-Ata, Kyrgyz Republic, decided to pass the chairmanship to Islamabad.
Pakistan welcomed the decision, calling it “a reflection of the confidence of SCO member states in Pakistan’s dedicated efforts and contribution towards regio­nal peace and security, particularly in combating terrorism”.
The FO said Islamabad would work to foster regional cooperation “guided by the Shanghai spirit of mutual trust, equality, and shared responsibility”.
The Tashkent-based RATS was created to coordinate counter-te­r­rorism, counter-separatism, and counter-extremism efforts amo­ng SCO members. Its mandate includes intelligence sharing, bu­­ilding databases of banned grou­­ps, joint drills, extradition arran­gements and coordinated operations.
But progress has often been constrained by political tensions, particularly between Pakistan and India as the
Kashmir dispute
and
terrorism allegations
have repeatedly undermined RATS initiatives.
During India’s 2022 chairmanship, efforts to expand a shared intelligence database stalled over disagreements, while participation in RATS-led drills and events has been inconsistent.
Meetings in 2023 and 2025 also saw public exchanges of accusations between the two countries, leaving China and Russia to play balancing roles.
Analysts say such disputes have eroded RATS’s neutrality and limited its ability to function as a seamless multilateral platform.
Despite these challenges, Pakistan pledged to work with SCO partners, international organisations and the United Nations to advance collective counter-terrorism efforts.
The Foreign Office said Pakistan would host events on cyber counterterrorism, information operations, border security, terrorist financing and capacity-building during its tenure.
“In order to develop cooperation, it is planned to hold expert events on the territory of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, including a practical seminar in the area of countering the use of the internet for terrorist, separatist and extremist purposes,” RATS Council said in an information note on the meeting in Kyrgyzstan.
The RATS Council, in its meeting, also approved plans for an executive cxommittee and expert groups, including measures to curb terrorist financing and prevent extremist movements across SCO states.
Members agreed to hold joint information campaigns against international terrorist organisations next year.
In a statement, the council condemned terrorist attacks committed this year on SCO territories, as well as military strikes on civilian facilities and Iran’s nuclear energy infrastructure, echoing language in the Tianjin Declaration of SCO heads of state.

Justice Jawad Hassan issued the order while disposing of a constitutional petition filed by the housing society against the Ministry of Water and Power, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), and other respondents.
The petition challenged the repeated power outages carried out under the pretext of ‘maintenance’, which according to the residents had become a routine, depriving them of their fundamental rights.
Represented by Advocate Tahir Jamil Butt, the society argued that electricity is a basic necessity of life and its denial amounts to a violation of Article 9 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life.
He submitted that “life seems impossible without electricity,” and that frequent load shedding not only disrupts household activities but also hampers education, businesses, healthcare, and public safety.
The counsel relied on earlier judgments of the
Supreme Court
and High Courts, including Engineer Iqbal Zafar Jhagra vs Federation of Pakistan, where electricity was explicitly recognized as a component of the right to life.
Another cited precedent, Haji Mohammad Latif vs GEPCO, declared that denial of electricity was a violation of fundamental rights in the modern technological era.
On behalf of the Federation, Barrister Zain Mansoor, Assistant Attorney General, and provincial law officers objected to the maintainability of the petition. They argued that the matter was already pending before the relevant authority and that the writ petition was therefore premature.
Justice Hassan, however, underscored that load shedding directly impacts the standard of living of citizens. “It disturbs daily life by stopping routine household works, study schedules, and business activities,” the judge noted, adding that hospitals and other essential services particularly become vulnerable during prolonged outages.
He observed that residents are forced to rely on expensive alternatives such as generators and UPS systems, pushing many into financial strain.
The court recalled multiple judgments where Pakistan’s superior judiciary held that electricity is integral to fundamental rights. In Naimatullah Khan Advocate vs Federation of Pakistan (2020 SCMR 622), the Supreme Court clarified that the right to life extends beyond mere existence to ensuring a “meaningful life” that includes access to electricity, water, health, and civic infrastructure.
Justice Hassan also quoted earlier remarks by Justice Umar Ata Bandial (later Chief Justice of Pakistan) in Judicial Activism Panel vs Government of Pakistan, which emphasized that unchecked load shedding requires not only long-term generation solutions but also short-term rationing measures based on fairness and efficiency.
In light of these principles, the court directed that the petition be treated as a formal representation. A copy of the petition and annexures will be forwarded to the Ministry of Energy, which has been ordered to provide a fair hearing to all stakeholders, including the housing society, and issue a reasoned, written decision within four weeks.
“The State bears the sole responsibility to provide basic necessities of life to citizens under Article 38(d) of the Constitution, which includes electricity,” the order stated.

The petitions, available with
Dawn.com
, named the IHC, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and the Federation of Pakistan as respondents and were filed under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
Article 184(3) sets out the SC’s original jurisdiction and enables it to assume jurisdiction in matters involving a question of “public importance” with reference to the “enforcement of any of the fundamental rights” of Pakistan’s citizens.
In their petitions, the judges moved the SC to declare that administrative powers could not be “deployed to undermine or trump the judicial powers” of the high court judges.
They further asked the apex court to declare that a chief justice of the high court was “not authorised to constitute benches or transfer cases” once a high court bench had been assigned a case.
Moreover, the petitions sought the declaration that the chief justice of a high court “cannot exclude available judges from the roster, at will, and use the power to issue a roster to oust judges from performing judicial functions”.
The SC was also urged to declare “that the constitution of benches, transfer of cases and issuance of roster can only be done in accordance with the rules adopted by the entirety of the High Court under Article 202 (rules of procedure), read with Article 192(1) (constitution of high court) of the Constitution”.
The petitioners also asked the apex court to declare that the “decision-making” with respect to the constitution of benches, issuance of roster and transfer of cases could not “solely rest in the hands of the chief justice”.
“Declare that the ‘Doctrine of the Master of the Roster’ has definitely been set aside in Supreme Court decisions,” the petitions read.
The petitions further sought the declaration that formation of IHC’s administration committees through notifications dated February 3  and July 15 and all the actions taken by them “suffer from mala fide in law and are illegal”. They asked the court to set aside these notifications and all actions taken by the administration committees constituted under them for “being illegal and coram non judice”.
Moreover, they stated: “Declare that the adoption and approval of Islamabad High Court Practice and Procedure Rules, 2025, by the illegally constituted administration committee, and its notification without prior approval of the high court is in breach of Article 192(1) and Article 202 of the Constitution, and its subsequent endorsement in September, are illegal and of no legal effect.”
The judges further stated in their prayers that the SC “direct the IHC to provide effective supervision and oversight” over the functioning of the district judiciary, as mandated by the Constitution under Article 203, which states that each high court shall supervise and control all courts subordinate to it.
The petitioner asked the SC to “declare that a high court cannot issue a writ under Article 199 of the Constitution to itself.” Article 199 pertains to the jurisdiction of a high court.
They continued: “A Division Bench of high court is neither vested with jurisdiction to sit in appeal over interlocutory orders of a single bench nor can assume control over the proceedings of a single bench as if it is an inferior court or tribunal.”
An interlocutory order refers to a temporary judgment passed in an ongoing case.
The petitioners requested the SC to declare that a high court judge can only be “restrained from working from performing judicial duties under Article 209 and a writ of quo warranto seeking the removal of a judge from office is not maintainable.”
Article 209 of the Constitution empowers the Supreme Judicial Council to carry out inquiries into the capacity and conduct of Supreme Court and high court judges.
The petitioners concluded their statement by asking the SC to “grant any other relief deemed appropriate in the circumstances of this case.”
Rift within IHC
Today’s development has once again highlighted deep fissures within the IHC, which gained prominence when Justice Dogar was appointed as the high court’s chief justice.
The fissures in the high court can be traced back to March last year, when in a
startling letter
written to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) members, the five IHC judges, along with Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir had accused the country’s intelligence apparatus of interference in judicial affairs, including attempts to pressure judges through abduction and torture of their relatives and secret surveillance inside their homes.
Widespread calls subsequently emerged from various quarters for a probe into the investigation, amid which former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa summoned a full court meeting of the Supreme Court’s judges. After a meeting between CJP Isa and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on March 28, the duo decided to form a commission to investigate the concerns of interference in judicial affairs following the cabinet’s approval. However, former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, who was appointed to head the commission, subsequently recused himself from the matter, leading to the apex court taking a suo motu notice of the issue.
In November 2024, the Supreme Judicial Council, chaired by incumbent CJP Yahya Afridi, who also heads the council, had considered different options concerning the letter and
agreed to expand consultations
, noting that the code of conduct of judges applies to heads of different institutions as well as judges.
Meanwhile, the 26th Constitutional Amendment was passed in October 2024, bringing many changes, most of which pertain to the judiciary.
Rumours began circulating in December 2024 that the judicial bureaucracy was reportedly planning to bring a judge from the Lahore High Court (LHC) to lead the IHC after the elevation of the then-IHC chief justice.
Traditionally, the senior puisne judge of a high court was appointed as the chief justice, but the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) had introduced new rules to bypass the seniority criterion in light of the 26th Amendment. The JCP had proposed that the chief justice of a high court could be appointed from among the panel of five senior-most judges.
In February 2025, the five IHC judges had
formally opposed
the then-potential transfer of then-LHC Justice Dogar, warning that his elevation as the IHC chief justice would violate constitutional procedures and judicial norms.
The letter was addressed to CJP Afridi, then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq, LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Sindh High Court Chief Justice Mohammad Shafi Siddiqui and raised serious concerns over the possible transfer.
However, Justice Dogar, who was sworn in as a LHC judge in June 2015, was formally transferred to the IHC on February 1. His transfer, along with those of two other judges, to the IHC had also impacted its seniority list and led to
many changes
as  Justice Kayani, who was senior puisne jud­ge before Justice Dogar’s transfer, has been removed from the top decision-making committee. Justice Kayani was also stripped of the position of inspection judge of the special courts.
The IHC administration had formally notified Jus­t­ice Dogar as the senior puisne IHC judge of the Islam­abad High Court and also revi­sed its seniority list.
The seniority list is as follows: Justice Dogar, Justice Kayani, Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, Justice Jahangiri, Jus­tice Sattar, Justice Ishaq Khan, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, Justice Saman Imtiaz, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro, Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, Justice Mohammad Asif and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas.
The five IHC judges had then
sent a representation
to the IHC chief justice and CJP Afridi against placing them down on the seniority list but this was
rejected
.
Justice Dogar was
appointed
as the acting IHC chief justice on Feb 13. The next day, he took the oath in a ceremony. All IHC judges were invited, but five of them — the same ones who filed petitions in the SC today —
did not attend
the ceremony and boycotted it.
Following the development, the IHC went through a
major administrative restructuring
, which notably reduced the authority of senior puisne judge Justice Kayani — who previously held key decision-making roles — following amendments to the high court rules.
The IHC Administration Com­mittee, previously comprising the chief justice, the senior puisne judge and a senior judge, was restructured to include CJ Dogar and two of his nominees. This reconstitution significantly altered the court’s decision-making authority.
On Feb 20, the five judges had petitioned the SC to
restrain
Justice Dogar from carrying out his duties as the acting IHC chief justice.
In March, Justice Sattar and Justice Imtiaz had
expressed concerns
over the demanding of gratuity by the court staff and changes to the rules that stripped the senior puisne judge of his powers.
A subsequent consolidation of all petitions related to ex-PM Imran Khan’s jail conditions apparently widened the gulf among the IHC judges as Justice Ishaq had
raised
critical questions about the transfer of a case pending before his court.
The tensions simmering among the IHC judges seemingly
boiled over
on March 21, when three members of the IHC Tribunal — who were replaced earlier this month when the tribunal was reconstituted — declared that neither the acting chief justice nor the president had the authority to dissolve or reconstitute the tribunal without legal justification.
Around the end of March, Justice Sattar had
questioned
the chief justice’s authority to administratively reassign cases, emphasising that such decisions fell within the jurisdiction of judges and the deputy registrar.
A
fresh controversy
emerged within the IHC in April over the acting chief justice’s authority to unilaterally transfer cases from single benches to division benches. The move reportedly spar­ked concerns about judicial procedure and administrative transparency.
A division bench comprising Justice Kayani and Justice Ishaq, while upholding an order previously issued by Justice Sattar, had expressed surprise at the recent transfer of several cases without clear legal justification.
The two judges subsequently ruled that the acting chief justice had
exceeded his authority
by transferring cases from one bench to another, calling for the ambiguity in judicial rules to be addressed through a full court meeting.
Meanwhile, amid the growing concerns among senior IHC judges over the shifting of cases between benches, Justice Minhas had issued a judicial verdict
reinforcing the authority
of the chief justice to assign and reassign cases, backing the top judge’s ex­­clusive role as the “Master of the Ros­ter”.
Ten­sions within the IHC
escalated sharply
on April 28, as two separate but interlinked proceedings exposed a deepening ‘institutional rift’ over judicial authority, procedural conduct and internal accountability.
Justice Sattar had issued a strongly worded order criticising the registrar’s office for not listing a case related to the removal of the former director general of Malir Development Authority from the no-fly list. The judge had issued the contempt notices to the heads of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Immi­gration and Passport.
However, a division bench comprising Justice Dogar had already suspended the contempt notices after the penalised government officials filed an intra-court appeal. The bench also merged the case with another identical matter. Subsequently, the case was not fixed before Justice Sattar on April 28 as was scheduled.
Justice Sattar had lambasted the deputy registrar (judicial) for what he described as “prima facie defiance” of court orders. He had summoned court officials to explain why the case was not listed before him and also the removal of his prior orders from the high court’s public database.
The case listing controversy escalated in May as two judges
accused
Justice Sattar of conducting unauthorised proceedings in a stay matter. However, in a dramatic courtroom episode, Justice Sattar had
openly challenged
the authority of a division bench, rejecting its order suspending his previous directive to remove a citizen’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL).
During the proceedings, the assistant attorney general had presented a copy of the division bench’s interim order, stating that Justice Sattar’s directive had been suspended. However, Justice Sattar had responded that he would continue hearing the case and issue a comprehensive judgement, arguing that the division bench could not lawfully suspend a single bench’s order in such a manner.
The simmering tensions among the high court judges had touched new heights around the end of May after a three-member tribunal declared another three-member tribunal comprising Justices Sattar, Ishaq and Jahangiri as “defunct” and
scrapped the order
regarding the repatriation of the judges.
On June 19, the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench (CB), by a majority of 3-2, had
ruled
that the transfer of three judges from provincial high courts to the IHC was in line with the Constitution. However, the bench had left it up to the president of Pakistan to determine the seniority amongst judges, based on their service records. The decision was later
appealed
by the five IHC judges.
However, Justice Dogar later
took his oath
as the IHC CJ on July 8. The five IHC senior judges were
sidelined
in the subsequent reshuffling of key committees.
On July 16, Justice Ishaq had given the federal government 30 days to
constitute a commission
to investigate misuse of the blasphemy law. However, a division bench comprising Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan later
suspended
the order’s imp­le­mentation.
Another
controversy
subsequently emerged in the Aafia Siddiqui case. On July 21, Justice Ishaq had put on notice the prime minister and the entire federal government. However, there was a question mark on the proceedings, since Justice Ishaq was not scheduled to hear the case or any other case that week.
The roster, approved by CJ Dogar, had not listed any case before the judge in question, since he was on a five-week leave from July 20. As a result, the IHC registrar’s office didn’t issue a cause list — schedule of cases — for Justice Ishaq’s court.
A senior official from the IHC chief justice’s office had told
Dawn
the cause list of Justice Ishaq’s court was cancelled and there was no case before him. Sources had said that Justice Ishaq’s staff had asked the registrar to issue a revised cause list, since the judge intended to hear some cases on July 21, despite being on leave. How­ever, the request was declined.
Subsequently, insiders claim­­ed, the judge’s staff had “issued a cause list bypassing the chief justice”. In his order, Justice Ishaq had accused the chief justice’s office of “deliberately sabotaging his judicial authority” by refusing to amend the weekly roster.
The registrar’s office subsequently
put on hold
the processing of the contempt of court notices. Later in August, the court
reassig­ned
the case from Justice Ishaq to Justice Minhas as part of a new “Roster of Sitting” that took effect from September 1, according to a court cause list.
Instead, earlier in August, Justice Ishaq was
placed on a special division bench
with Justice Sattar to hear tax references and related commercial matters, a posting that prevents members from sitting as single-judge courts.
Sources had said the two judges would not hold single benches until a backlog of around 2,000 Commercial Litigation Corridor cases was cleared. In the meantime, petitions on their individual dockets would be taken up by other available benches. The decision was taken by CJ Dogar.
Legal experts had said that with the development, the IHC’s senior judges, including those who had challenged the transfer and subsequent seniority of the incumbent chief justice, would now be occupied with clearing the years-long backlog of financial cases.
Earlier this month, a full court IHC meeting had adopted the High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2025 despite strong resistance from senior judges. The rules were passed by a slim majority, while a proposal from two judges, seeking changes to the meeting’s agenda, was rejected.
A day before the full court meeting, Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Ishaq wrote a letter to their colleagues, expressing grave concerns that administrative powers were allegedly being misused to “sideline dissenting judges”. Later, they also objected to the way the rules were presented at the meeting, complaining that “insufficient time” had been provided for a proper review.
Justice Sattar and Justice Ishaq reportedly objected to the way case assignments were being structured, alleging that the process was “manipulated to favour” judges transferred to the IHC along with the chief justice, while sidelining permanent judges who had opposed his transfer.
Last week, the IHC
fixed
for hearing a petition challenging the appointment of Justice Jahangiri over allegations of possessing an invalid law degree. In an
extraordinary development
on Tuesday, CJ Dogar and Justice Azam restrained the senior judge from exercising his judicial powers.
The decision sparked immediate outrage among the bar associations. His degree issue surfaced last year, while he was hearing the election petitions of runners-up of all three constituencies of Islamabad.
The lawmakers of the ruling party were visibly not comfortable with the proceedings of the election tribunal and the government, in the meantime, issued an ordinance that enabled the appointment of a retired judge to head the election tribunal.
Matters came to a head when the IHC administration
stripped
Justice Imtiaz of her powers to entertain harassment complaints after she took cognisance of a complaint lodged by lawyer Imaan Mazari against CJ Dogar.
A circular from her office had said that, being the competent authority under the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010, the inquiry committee comprising Justice Ishaq, Justice Tahir and Justice Imtiaz was formed to conduct an inquiry into the complaints of harassment.
However, the court administration had sw­iftly de-notified her as the competent au­­thority and replaced her with Justice Minhas.",2025-09-19,Umer Mehtab,4666,0.00041

Military Lands and Cantonment Director General Maj Gen Irfan Ahmad Malik unveiled a new initiative of Internal Audit Framework for Cantonment Boards across the country to ensure enhancing transparency, accountability and operational excellence.
According to a press release, external audits are already being conducted by the Directorate General Audit Defence Services (ADS), the need for an internal mechanism had long been felt to ensure corrective measures are taken in time and to reduce the number of audit observations during external reviews.
The newly-instituted system has been designed with clear objectives: Transparency and Uniformity in auditing practices, accountability at all levels of field offices, preventive and remedial action to identify irregularities or unwarranted practices at their earliest stage.
A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) devised by Director Headquarters Dr Saima Shah, has been formulated, providing well-defined processes for conducting inspection audits in a fair and competitive manner.
This initiative standardises practices across boards, ensures compliance and creates a strong foundation for proactive governance. This reform emphasises the institution’s commitment to strengthening internal checks.
The framework will serve not just as a set of guidelines but as a pledge to build trust, ensure financial discipline and deliver impactful results at the grassroots level.
The Internal Audit Framework is primarily preventive, remedial and curative in nature. By identifying and addressing acts of omission, commission, irregularities or illegalities at the initial stage, the system curbs unwarranted practices before they escalate.
This strengthens the financial systems of cantonment boards, ensuring optimal output through adherence to rules and procedures. The Military Lands and Cantonments Department affirms that this initiative will not only streamline audit processes but also boost the overall credibility and performance of cantonment boards, reinforcing their role in service delivery and good governance.

flooding
in the Narowal district.
As per details, the high-level floods in the river Ravi and rainwater drains Auj, Baein, Basantar and Dek wiped out farmlands and devastated the farming community.
Due to the lack of an industrial zone in Narowal district, the livelihood of locals depends on agriculture and farming is done on 355,425 acres of land. Farmers grow rice, wheat, vegetables, pulses and animal fodder on these lands.
Locals report that four to five feet of floodwater has been accumulated in their fields. Adding insult to injury, the already suffering farmers and citizens lost their homes, while roads and other infrastructure was also destroyed in the floods.
Farmers say wheat cultivation not possible without financial assistance
Narowal Deputy Commissioner Syed Hassan Raza told
Dawn
that crops cultivated on 140,250 acres of land had been lost due to the floods. He said that farmers in Shakargarh tehsil suffered the most due to the floods as 77,090 acres of land had been submerged in the area.
He said that 45,617 acres of agricultural land was under floodwater in Narowal tehsil and 17,543 acres in Zafarwal. He said that the rice crop cultivated on 84,000 acres had been lost due to the floods. He said that the floodwaters washed away fodder for animals cultivated on 8,176 acres of land.
Farmer Muhammad Yaqoob said that farmers had suffered a loss of more than 10 billion rupees due to the flood. He said that the world-famous rice of Narowal was the biggest loss as it was the most cultivated in the district.
Another farmer Muhammad Afzal said that the loss caused to farmers was unbearable and now it was not possible for them to cultivate wheat without financial assistance. He said that their houses were also damaged and livestock sheds had been washed away. Grains, wheat seeds, urea fertiliser, agricultural machinery were also affected, he added.
He said that farmers had taken loans for fertilisers, agricultural chemicals and other needs and these loans were to paid after their harvest. How would farmers meet household expenses, children’s education and start farming again for the whole year, he asked.
To a question, the DC said that teams from the revenue and agriculture departments were assessing the losses suffered by farmers. He said that financial assistance would be provided to them as per the government’s policy.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1938781/consortium-alleges-parliamentary-interference-in-adb-funded-n-55-highway-project,Consortium alleges parliamentary interference in ADB-funded N-55 highway project - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: A consortium led by a Chinese firm has appealed to Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani to intervene against what it described as the “misuse of the Senate platform” to obstruct the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded N-55 CAREC Tranche-III highway expansion
project
.
In a letter dated Aug 26, the NXCC–RA–DC Joint Venture, comprising Ningxia Communications Construction, Rustam Associates and Dynamic Constructors, alleged that sitting senators were attempting to derail the award of contracts for the dualisation of 326 kilometres of the N-55 highway between Rajanpur, D.G. Khan and D.I. Khan. The project, executed by the National Highway Authority (NHA), is seen as vital for regional connectivity and economic development.
The joint venture claimed it was lawfully declared the lowest evaluated bidder with a margin of Rs13.2 billion for all four construction lots after a transparent and ADB-approved process. However, the letter alleged that the losing bidders engaged Senator Saifullah Abro to pressure government officials into reopening the concluded bidding process.
The letter accused Senator Abro of adopting an “aggressive and dismissive” attitude in parliamentary forums, compelling officials to revisit the procurement despite the ADB’s issuance of a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) and the federal government’s sovereign commitment under its loan agreement with ADB to only engage a contractor acceptable to the lender.
Letter seeks Senate chairman’s intervention; senator vows to blacklist firm over alleged non-compliance and misrepresentation
“This misuse of parliamentary privilege and public office jeopardises a nationally significant project, unfairly maligns dedicated public servants, and risks Pakistan’s reputation with international financial partners,” the letter stated.
The consortium has urged the Senate chairman to protect the sanctity of the House from being used as a tool for “vested commercial interests” and to ensure the project moves forward without further obstruction.
The Rs146 billion N-55 project forms part of Pakistan’s commitments under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) programme, co-financed by the ADB. Any delays, observers warn, could impact Pakistan’s credibility with international lenders and slow progress on critical infrastructure aimed at boosting trade and connectivity.
Earlier this year, Mishal Pakistan, a partner institute of the World Economic Forum, also raised concerns over conflict of interest in parliamentary proceedings. In a letter to the Senate chairman, it cautioned that such practices would undermine the credibility of the Senate and create distrust among the public if not addressed transparently. When contacted by
Dawn
, Senator Saif Ullah Abro, however, said the letter was nothing but a “pressure tactic” to stop him from discussing a project worth Rs173 billion.
Mr Abro, who is also the chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, said he had called meetings of the committee to discuss the issue due to which some elements were not happy with him. He said the company may contact anyone but he was not scared of them.
“Now things have reached to a point where companies have been dictating parliament. Fact is that it has been proved that the company has been using fake documents and even National Highway Authority (NHA) has informed the committee in writing that the company is not willing to share its documents related to experience and other abilities,” he claimed.
Senator Abro said the matter was also handed over to a subcommittee headed by Senator Pervez Rasheed and it recommended cancelling the contract.
“If company managed to get one contract in Pakistan, it will be used in future as a precedent and the company will get more contracts in future. Pakistan is not a piece of cake as everyone wants to get a share. We are working for a national cause and will not allow anyone to rob Pakistan,” he said.
Senator Abro claimed that he will make all possible efforts to blacklist the company as it failed to provide documents.

KP Action (in Aid of Civil Power) Ordinance
, declaring it against basic human rights and urged the provincial government to withdraw a plea in its favour from the apex court.
The resolution, moved by treasury member Daud Shah in a session chaired by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, said that if the Constitution was examined, the KP Actions (in aid of civil power) Ordinance, 2019, and Regulations, 2011, went against the basic human rights and the Peshawar High Court had already declared it so, but the provincial government appealed the verdict in the Supreme Court.
“This house recommends to the provincial government to declare implementation of the said law in KP and merged districts against basic rights and withdraw its appeal about it from the Supreme Court,” the resolution read.
The KP Action (in Aid of Civil Power) Ordinance, 2019, which was issued by the provincial governor on Aug 5, 2019, is almost a reproduction of two regulations promulgated by the president in 2011 for the then Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) and Provincially Administered Tribal Areas (Pata), giving legal cover to several detention centres set up during military operations in different regions.
Forms special panel on security
It assigns wide-ranging powers to the authorised officers and armed forces and grants an authority to detain a suspect until the continuation of action in aid of civil power by the armed forces.
Also, the house constituted a special committee on security. It will check and decide its terms of reference in the first meeting.
The meeting of the 30-member committee will be chaired by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati and attended by members from merged districts and those with volatile law and order situation. Some stakeholders will be in attendance on special invitation.
The security committee, formed after consensus of both treasury and opposition after the conclusion of discussion on the law and order situation in the provincial assembly, will be briefed by the relevant officials involved in operations against terrorism.
Also, the data will be shared with lawmakers. The members will discuss ways to restore peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Earlier, chief whip of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Akbar Ayub Khan said that the treasury and opposition held a sitting for constituting a house committee on the law and order situation in the province.
“Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur has sent a message for you to constitute a joint committee comprising all stakeholders. He will also be part of the committee and meetings will be held with people related to institutions on law and order,” Mr Khan said.
Leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah said debate should be held. He said ToRs for the committee should be finalised and a meeting should be held for a way forward as soon as possible.
PPP member Ahmad Kundi suggested that people’s representatives from terrorism-hit areas be included.
“Either the speaker or leader of the opposition should chair the committee,” he said.
He said that the opposition’s proposals and ToRs were ready and would be shared with the speaker.
ANP member Nisar Baaz said the opposition had suggested formation of the committee and people had left their houses and accommodated in schools, which had an impact on the educational system in his constituency of Bajaur district.
“The XI corps commander and the police chief should be summoned to the house for an in-camera briefing over their claims about clearing two tehsils of Bajaur district as those areas await such clearance,” he said.
The lawmaker said lawmakers from tribal districts should be engaged to share the ground situation.
Special assistant to the chief minister on housing Dr Amjad Ali said that the opposition leader’s suggestion was discussed with the chief minister.
He said a special committee should be formed with representation from tribal districts and the other areas where military operations are ongoing.
“We want this issue to be resolved and agree to call the corps commander and police chief to the house for a briefing on the reasons for terrorism resurgence and the way-out,” he said.
Mr Kundi said the federal government had to hold at least four meetings of the Council of Common Interest annually with each held after a gap of 90 days.
He said that the province could formally seek an urgent CCI meeting. The lawmaker insisted that the federal government was not fulfilling its Constitutional obligation.
“A discussion should be held in the relevant house committee to ensure a CCI meeting is held after every 90 days,“ he said.
Minister for law and parliamentary affairs Aftab Alam Afridi said the CCI chairman was bound to call the body’s meeting but unfortunately,there were many issues including a delay in the meeting of the National Finance Commission.
“When somebody takes the province’s chief executive lightly, how do you expect them to hold a meeting on recommendations of a house committee?”
Speaker Swati observed that a house committee with members from both treasury and opposition benches holding a meeting was like parliament standing by the government.
The house passed the KP Charities Amendment Bill, 2025, and KP Legal Aid Amendment Bill, 2025. The bills were tabled by Mr Afridi.
The members also unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the health, social welfare and education departments devise a system providing free career counselling, psychological therapy and, if needed, psychiatric treatment to young people facing challenges in a remote region and that the facilities be available at UC levels and a telephone hotline be set up for suicide prevention.
The resolution moved by Fatehul Mulk Ali Nasir read that Lower and Upper Chitral districts face immense social issues, especially affecting youth women and highly-educated men.
The house also passed a resolution seeking the issuance of driving licences by the police department saying the transport department lacks trained staff and technical facilities.
The resolution was moved by treasury MPA Ubaidur Rehman.
Special assistant to the chief minister Rangez Ahmad informed the house that around 0.2 million driving licences would be issued within a month and the pendency of applications would be removed.
He also said 10,000 licences would be “available“ by tomorrow [Wednesday].
The chair later adjourned the session until 2pm today (Tuesday).

“We have cordoned off the area on our side of the boundary, while GB police have also taken similar measures to ensure the rounding up of the fleeing terrorists,” district police officer Shafiullah Khan Gandapur, who rushed to the scene after the attack, told reporters on Monday.
The armed men, positioned in the nearby mountains, fired at the patrolling van, leaving two of the five policemen on board seriously injured. A search and strike operation was launched immediately after the incident on both sides of Babusar Top, he added.
The injured policemen were first shifted to a health facility in Naran and later referred to Ayub Medical Complex Hospital, Abbottabad.
Authorities said both KP and GB police had already enforced a night travel ban on the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road in upper parts of the Kaghan Valley. Passenger coaches and other vehicles were only allowed to cross Babusar Top in police-led convoys. “The Chilas (GB) police have also sealed the artery on their side to prevent the terrorists from escaping,” Mr Gandapur said.
He said that police were fully prepared to thwart such cowardly acts carried out by armed groups sneaking into the Kaghan Valley from the neighbouring Chilas district of GB. “We are committed to ensuring the safety of our forces and passengers travelling between KP and GB via Kaghan Valley, and those behind this attack will soon be apprehended,” the DPO said.
Meanwhile, Hazara DIG Nasir Mehmood Satti visited the AMC and enquired after the injured policemen. “I have no words to praise the lofty courage and bravery you demonstrated while confronting terrorists in the line of duty,” he said.

In North Waziristan, an ongoing operation by security forces in the Datta Khel area killed eight militants in the mountainous Khursin and Doga Macha regions.
The slain militants were linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur and Jaish-i-Mehdi Karwan groups, including a bomb-making expert, sources claimed.
According to sources, some militants are still in hiding, using civilians as human shields to deter strikes on their location.
Separately in Lakki Marwat, security forces killed two militants in a clash late on Sunday night. A police official said that police and counter-terrorism units encountered terrorists near the Mangala forest during a search and strike operation.
“When the law enforcers reached near the forest, they saw eight to ten terrorists armed with advanced weapons,” he said.
The militants fired at police, triggering a half-hour gunfight. Afterward, two terrorists were found dead, while others fled into the dark forest.
The law enforcers seized arms and ammunition and shifted the bodies to the THQ Hospital in Serai Naurang town.
Also in Lakki Marwat, two relatives of a police official were wounded when terrorists attacked his home in the Mir Qalam Pull area.
Head constable Sanaullah said in a preliminary report that his family awoke to dogs barking at midnight. When his brother, Rafaqatullah, 22, and wife, Rehana Bibi, 40, went outside their rooms, gunfire erupted.
“In the meanwhile, an intense firing started and he immediately took position in the rooftop watchtower,” Sanaullah said.
He saw armed men firing, injuring his brother and wife. He returned fire for twenty minutes, causing the attackers to flee. The injured were taken to a Bannu hospital, and search for the assailants was underway.
Meanwhile, six suspected bandits injured three motorcyclists near Pasani under Serai Gambila police jurisdiction on Sunday night. Victims were riding a motorcycle when the bandits signalled them to stop with a torch. Upon not stopping, the bandits opened fire.
The injured were taken to THQ Hospital in Serai Naurang, and a case was filed against the unidentified attackers.

prone
to incidents like torrential rainfall, flashfloods and cloudburst, given its geographical locale.
On August 28, the provincial government wrote a letter and addressed federal secretaries of economic affairs division and planning, development and special initiatives.
The letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, read that the number of adverse climatic events had surged and intensified. Such incidents could take place in future as well, that too at a wider scale, it added.
“In this regard, we would request the ministry of planning, development and special initiatives and ministry of economic affairs to support the KP’s cause in seeking assistance from partners to enhance climate resilience, using cutting edge interventions,” said the letter.
Letter says details of damage should not be considered final as monsoon spell continues
The provincial government sought investments in, but not limited to, advanced early warning systems, flood resilience, watershed management, climate resilient infrastructure and communication networks, climate smart agriculture and nature-based solutions.
The letter said that following the meeting on flood damage and relief activities held on August 19, a damage assessment survey was conducted to engage with development partners for refinancing of loans to rehabilitate the affected areas. It added that following torrential rainfall, flash floods and incidents of cloudburst in eight districts, the provincial government responded immediately and deployed all available resources.
A comprehensive survey was initiated to assess the damage and special teams were deployed to verify it and compile report for perusal of competent authorities and relevant development partners.
According to data, the catastrophe left 406 dead and 248 injured. Livestock damage was 5412, crops lost on 57,892 acres, 667 house were destroyed while 2,520 were partially damaged, 1,280 shops were destroyed, 513 kilometres of roads were damaged, 47 bridges were destroyed, 41 culverts, 691 schools, 60 health facilities, 477 irrigation schemes, and 367 public health engineering schemes were also destroyed.
The letter said that the details should not be considered final as the monsoon spell had extended and affected 14 districts. Apart from infrastructure, the federal government was informed that the KP government was providing compensation of Rs2 million for each life lost and Rs5 million for each injured person.
“Interim assessments indicate restoration and rehabilitation cost of damage to government infrastructures including roads, bridges, culverts, irrigation, public health engineering, health and education structures to be around Rs20 billion,” the letter said.
It added that it was important to note that compensation being paid for damage to private structures was separate from the stated figure.
It said that the KP chief minister had approved compensation for damaged shops, previously not covered under Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) policy.
The letter said that the provincial government had so far released Rs6.5 billion for immediate relief efforts, including evacuations, rescue operations, provision of cooked food and non-food items, as well as compensation for the deceased, injured and private property damaged by the catastrophe. It added that the rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure should commence on emergency basis subsequent to the ongoing survey and technical formalities.
The provincial government extended its gratitude to the federal government for being cognisant of the damage and providing support to approach the development partners to engage them in rehabilitation works.
“The provincial government effectively undertook relief and rescue operations through own sources. It has completed considerable restoration works and is well-equipped to undertake the rehabilitation of the damaged infrastructure,” it said.
The letter said that the government had commenced an exercise to identify existing internationally financed projects with unutilised components destined for de-scoping to be repurposed for financing rehabilitation, if required.
The provincial government said it looked forward to partners to enhance capacities of provincial departments and first line responders as per international best practices to effectively cope with such disasters besides proposed financing in enhancement of anticipatory resilience of vulnerable communities.

104 new lodges
has not only multiplied the cost but also created avoidable financial burdens on the public exchequer.
The subcommittee of the Senate House Committee headed by Senator Nasir Mehmood met on Friday. The participants stressed that there was no justification for further delay.
Senators Danesh Kumar, Hidayatullah Khan and Poonjo Bheel also attended the meeting.
The committee noted with concern that although the project was approved as far back as 2009 to meet the growing accommodation needs of parliamentarians, it has remained plagued by repeated delays.
CDA says work stalled several times due to lack of funds and political gatherings near site
CDA officials said work stalled several times due to lack of funds and political disruptions near the site. In 2015, the contractor demanded a steep cost escalation, leading to prolonged litigation. The committee was told that in 2025 a revised PC-I was approved at a cost of Rs7,170 million, and the contract was awarded to Mian Usman Umer & Company.
The committee observed that the prolonged delays have multiplied costs, adding with Rs3.5 billion already available, there was no justification for further inaction. Senator Mehmood directed CDA to immediately commence work and said timely completion is essential to avoid yet another cycle of cost escalations and litigation.
The committee further directed that the ministries of interior and planning must conduct site visits and submit progress reports to ensure consistent progress and transparency and accountability in the work. The committee will also visit the site.
On the matter of renovation of existing lodges, the committee expressed dissatisfaction over the deteriorated condition of the buildings despite claims of heavy expenditures.
The members said that thorough inspections will be carried out, and CDA was tasked to provide lodge-wise details of renovation costs, materials used, and justification for excessive spending.
The head of the committee remarked that accountability in the use of public money is non-negotiable and that disproportionate spending on a few lodges will not be tolerated.
The committee directed the chairman CDA to constitute an internal committee comprising well-reputed officers to conduct the initial investigations into the quality of the work and spending of amounts on each lodge during last two years.
The convener of the subcommittee pressed for transparency, demanding that CDA submit an internal inquiry report within 21 days.
The committee also raised the issue of poor cleanliness standards at Parliament Lodges. Members noted that janitorial staffers deputed for the task were not performing their duties effectively. Details of the janitorial contract, staff deployment and associated costs were sought.
The chairman CDA highlighted the additional financial burden on the civic agency due to the absorption of PWD employees after the department’s closure.
He requested supplementary funding to meet salary obligations.
The committee directed the ministries of finance and interior to resolve the matter on priority, stressing that institutional gaps should not hinder operational efficiency.

According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted the IBO on the night between Friday and Saturday, on the “reported presence of
khwarij
belonging to Indian proxy,
Fitna al Khwarij
.”
The state uses the term
Fitna al Khwarij
to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
During the operation, “own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and resultantly, seventeen Indian sponsored
khwarij
were sent to hell,” the ISPR statement said.
It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, “who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies, as well as [in the] killing of innocent civilians”.
The statement said a sanitisation operation was being conducted to “eliminate any other Indian-sponsored
khwarji

“And for the purpose, special courts to expedite decisions on land grabbing cases with mandatory resolution within 90 days will be established in the province,” she said.

In some recent incidents, Pera officials were allegedly found involved in corruption.
Ms Nawaz said Pera was aimed at fighting inflation, hoarding and encroachment. She lauded that Pera force played a key role during the recent floods, engaging in rescue, relief and rehabilitation operations across Punjab.

“Money earned through corrupt practices brings no good to anyone,” she told Pera officials.

Registration deadline in all universities located within the flood-affected districts has been extended by 20 days, whereas deadline for applying for ‘Honhaar’ scholarship has been extended by a month, says a handout.

Speaking at a gathering of overseas Pakistanis in London, the prime minister said that Pakistan wanted to hold dialogue with India on
contentious issues
like Kashmir, terrorism, water and trade on the basis of equality.
The prime minister said that without the resolution of the Kashmir issue, which was the key to the regional peace, bilateral ties between the two countries could not be established.
“Anyone who is thinking otherwise is akin to living in a fool’s paradise,” he said, adding that Kashmiris would get their right to self-determination and freedom.
Expresses grief over 64,000 deaths, grave humanitarian situation in Gaza
“I have made this offer so many times in the past. We want to discuss Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism issues, not because of any weakness but on the basis of equal terms,” the prime minister said.
After visiting Saudi Arabia, PM Shehbaz made a stopover in London for four days and then he will proceed to the US on Monday to attend United Nations General Assembly
conference
.
He said that as the ceasefire between Pakistan and India had been achieved, Pakistan wanted peace, progress and prosperity and an end to unemployment and poverty.
Underlining the significance of unity and solidarity which led to triumph in the recent armed conflict with India, PM Shehbaz pledged to guide the country on the path of progress and prosperity.
The prime minister said that after India’s baseless allegations over Pah­algam incident, he had offered, during his visit to Kakul, a probe by an international committee into the incident in a fair, impartial and transparent manner, but India did not respond to his offer.
On May 6,
aggression
was unleashed against the innocent civilians and civilian assets were attacked inside Pakistan, leading to causalities, he said, adding that Pakistan in its right of defence, downed six enemy’s fighter jets in one go which made the enemy realise its precarious position.
Expressing his grief over 64,000 deaths and grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, he said the world had not witnessed such heart-wrenching scenes
The prime minister called upon the Islamic world and the international community to come forward and address the issue urgently.
He said that on the basis of hard work of overseas Pakistanis, in the previous year, the country received $38.5 billion in remittances, adding that without this contribution of overseas Pakistanis, the country’s economy could not move forward.
He said the country’s economic indicators were showing upward trends and at the diplomatic front, the country was strengthening its ties and position.
Speaking on the occasion, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar said that overseas Pakistanis were the country’s diplomats.
He said in the year 2022, when the incumbent government came to power, it was a difficult time as the country was at the verge of default, and the global rating agencies and institutions were setting dates in this regard.
He said the nation saluted the prime minister for his dynamic leadership that ensured economic turnaround.
Enumerating the downward trends in the inflation and interest rates, he resolved that the government was striving for the economic empowerment.
Referring to the Indian aggression, he said Pakistan defeated an enemy that boasted of its armed power and regional net security provider, adding that the myth was buried on May 10.
Referring to climate change impact, Mr Dar said that Pakistan was vulnerable to climate change and the government was devising projects so that in the coming years, the country could be able to cope with this challenge.
He said the government was also raising its voice for the equality and justice, because the climate change was a matter of justice, not only for Pakistan but for any country suffering from the emissions worldwide.

The Toshakhana record, made public by the cabinet division for the period between January and June 2025, lists high-value items such as watches, luxury vehicles, carpets, handicrafts, and traditional artefacts presented to top state functionaries, including the president, prime minister, ministers, and senior officials during foreign visits and local engagements.
The data, comprising 137 entries, records gifts received from heads of state, royal families, diplomats, and business delegations. However, the value of these gifts is still being assessed by the cabinet division.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received a total of 61 gifts, mostly decorative and traditional items. These included several high-end wristwatches. Notably, on the first day of 2025, he was presented with two luxury wristwatches — an IWC Schaffhausen and a Panerai, both with warranty cards — by Sheikh Abdul Hadi Mana Al-Hajri of Qatar.

The Shah of the State of Selangor, Malaysia, gifted PM Shehbaz a ‘Golden Kris’ — a traditional Malaysian dagger. Additionally, the president of Turkiye presented him with an electric car.
During his visit to Azerbaijan, the prime minister received a handmade silk carpet and other items. The President of Tajikistan gifted him a box containing a golden teacup with a spoon.
While in
Saudi Arabia
, PM Shehbaz received a model of Mimbar-e-Rasool from Prince Mansour Bin Muhammad Bin Saad bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, and a wooden box containing two documents — the Charter of Makkah in English and Arabic — from Dr Mohammad Abdulkareem Al-Issa, Secretary General of the Muslim World League.
From Iran
, the PM was presented with a wall hanging and a shield by the Chief of General Staff. Other gifts included handmade carpets, onyx decorations, paintings, tea sets, books, and shields.
Interestingly, while the Saudi hosts did not overwhelm the prime minister with lavish gifts, several Pakistani officials
visiting the Kingdom
— led by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi — received high-end wristwatches.
On Jan 28, Interior Minister of Saudi Arabia gifted six Rolex watches, five Tudor watches, three Black Armin watches, and nine Frank Rosha watches to Pakistani officials, primarily government officers.
The record shows that President Asif Ali Zardari received 11 gifts, including a ladies’ suit and a bedsheet from the High Commissioner of Bangladesh. The most valuable among his gifts was an electric vehicle from the president of Turkiye. He also received a carpet from the Iranian foreign minister, as well as vases, candle stands, shields, a coffee set, and onyx items.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Ishaq Dar
received several Afghan carpets and traditional bowls, while Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was presented with prayer mats and Turkish handicrafts.
Other ministers, advisers, and security officials were gifted watches, rugs, wall hangings, and porcelain items.

law and order
situation in the country, saying everyone’s life is under threat.
“There is no peace in the country. The situation has reached such an alarming level that returning home unhurt is considered a blessing,” he told the provincial general council of JUI-F here on Sunday.
He alleged that state had failed to ensure peace as it had become helpless before the terrorists, who were roaming scot-free.
He linked the current turmoil in the country with the interests of international powers.
JUI-F chief says govt failed to bring any change in policy
“The prevailing unrest has been created by these forces to achieve their goals as this situation suits their interests,” he added.
The JUI-F chief said that international interests were being preferred over Pakistan’s interest that was why the path of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor was being blocked.
He said that they had reservations about the previous government of Imran Khan, however, the current government could not bring about a change in the policy.
Commenting on increasing terrorism in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said that militants had not returned to KP and rest of the country rather they were brought back.
He said that international powers were fully involved in Pakistan’s politics and created such environment, which served their interests.
Mr Rehman also came down hard on the PTI government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for what he called its bad governance and alleged corruption. He said that establishment imposed the PTI government on Pakhtuns.
He said that those, who were patronising the PTI government, were equally responsible for destroying the province.
He said that the real owners of mineral resources in KP were the people of the province and the coming generations. “If the rights of the people at local and provincial level are usurped then JUI-F will resist it at all forums,” he added.
Earlier, the provincial general council of JUI-F expressed concerns over the deteriorating law and order situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The participants of the meeting said that people were yearning for peace.
The JUI-F leaders also criticised the provincial government for not doing well during the recent devastating floods, which severely hit several districts of the province including Buner, Swat, Dir Lower, Shangla and others.
The meeting was chaired by provincial chief of JUI-F Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman.
The meeting was attended by the members of the general council from across the province.
“People have been disappointed with the government’s role in the recent floods,” said a statement of the party issued here.
The provincial general council of JUI-F also paid tributes to district organisations of party in Buner, Swat, Shangla, Swabi and Mansehra, especially JUI-F leader Mufti Fazl Ghafoor, for their role in relief activities in the flood-hit areas.
The council also decided to hold Mufti Mahmood Conference in Dera Ismail Khan on October 16.
During the meeting, one-year performance report of the executive council of JUI-F was presented by Mohammad Rahim Haqqani while media report was presented by Abdul Jalil Jan.
The meeting also extended heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families of the people affected by the devastating floods and expressed the determination that cooperation with the affected families would continue.
The meeting also expressed concerns over announcements about outsourcing certain educational institutions and hospitals and ‘corruption’ in the province.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945406/uns-birthday-blues,UN’s birthday blues - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THE UN marks 80 years of its founding in a state of uncertainty with its credibility increasingly in question.
The General Assembly’s high-level week was dominated by Palestine and the war in Gaza. This brought into sharp focus the UN’s failure to live up to its core mission and primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. True it is big powers who are to blame for the UN’s paralysis in stopping the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. But UN inaction and lack of activist diplomacy on issues of war and peace have left its reputation damaged.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres has repeatedly warned that trust in global institutions is at a breaking point with ailing multilateral organisations in need of urgent reform. The loss of faith in multilateralism, he has said, is because people see “broken promises, unmet commitments, double standards, and vast inequalities”.
Although multilateralism has been under stress for well over a decade President Donald Trump’s conduct has accelerated this trend and magnified the pressure. US disengagement from the UN is reflected in its
exit
from WHO, Unesco, UNRWA (UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees) and decision to stop funding and withdraw from the Human Rights Council. Trump’s unilateralist actions have also shown contempt for the principles of the UN Charter.
Other big states and regional powers have also played their part by acting in defiance of international law and violating the UN Charter. In a recent essay in
The Economist
co-authored with Helen Clark, former UNSG Ban Ki-moon wrote: “The UN is slipping into dysfunction as some of its traditional champions, notably the United States, retreat from multilateral cooperation, cut funding and disregard the rule of law when it suits them.”
At the heart of UN’s dysfunction lies the Security Council’s paralysis.
The contrast could not have been sharper during UNGA’s high-level week. Kicking off the debate, Guterres said the world needed the UN’s “unique legitimacy” and convening power. To no one’s surprise, Trump
voiced
his characteristic disdain for the UN. He lashed out at the world body on several counts and falsely accused it of funding migrants to ‘invade’ Western countries.
Just before he spoke, Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said multilateralism is at a new crossroads, with the ideals that inspired the UN’s founders under unprecedented threat. He lamented the UN’s weakening authority while calling on it to revive its role as a “promoter of equality, peace, sustainable development, diversity and tolerance”.
In fact, the common refrain in speeches at the debate was the UN’s ineffectiveness at a time when it is needed most to deal with multiple challenges. Many leaders condemned the resort to unilateralism by some and stressed the need to strengthen multilateralism. They also urged the UN to reclaim and reassert its authority.
Beyond these speeches, the widespread view across the world is that the UN has become increasingly irrelevant as it acts as a bystander in wars and crises. If the UN is seen as failing to deliver on its core goal of maintaining international peace and security, the rest of what it does (some of it quite well; say, on the development pillar of its mandate and humanitarian initiatives) fades into insignificance. It is on the peace and security pillar that the UN is judged by governments and publics everywhere and seen not to be ‘fit for purpose’.
That is the Security Council’s responsibility but deadlock and rivalry between the big powers — its five veto-wielding permanent members — prevents the Council from acting. Nothing illustrates this better than the two main wars of the moment in Gaza and Ukraine.
The US has been the obstacle in ending the war Israel imposed on Gaza, exercising the veto six times in the past two years to scotch ceasefire resolutions. This marks a continuity in Washington’s policy which over decades has seen it use the veto 51 times to shield Israel. On Ukraine, Russia has used the veto several times on resolutions against its
2022 invasion
. This has left the Security Council completely logjammed.
In response to rising criticism of the UN and funding cuts, the secretary general announced the UN 80 reform initiative. This seeks to build on previous reforms in management, development and peace and security. It is aimed at streamlining mandates and making the UN leaner and more efficient. But this is unlikely to change much.
Driven by funding shortages, these reforms may be used to end mandates deemed as “inefficient” on politically motivated grounds and reflecting the priorities of big powers. This will make the reform process disputed.
In any case, what is consequential to the UN’s effectiveness and credibility is reform of the Security Council. What lies at the heart of UN dysfunction is the Council’s paralysis. As usual, calls for its reform were heard from world leaders during UNGA. Negotiations have been going on in the General Assembly for over 20 years but with little progress except agreement on expanding the Council. The veto continues to be a source of intense contention.
The principal disagreement is between countries that aspire for permanent seats for themselves and others who oppose more permanent members and, instead, propose enlarging the Council by adding more elected, non-permanent members. This has put the G4 — Germany, Japan, India and Brazil — at odds with the Uniting for Consensus (UFC) countries led by Italy and including Pakistan.
The UFC seeks a more representative, accountable and effective Council by adding elected members who can counter-balance the power of the veto-wielding P5 countries. It argues the Council’s chronic deadlocks are due to discord and clashing interests of the P5, which prevents it from playing its due role. Adding more veto-empowered permanent members will compound this dysfunction, not end it.
Even if the impasse is overcome, reform is a complicated process that requires amendment of the UN Charter. This involves the General Assembly adopting a resolution by a two-thirds majority, which then has to be ratified by at least two-thirds of the UN membership as well as the P5. This makes reform a remote possibility. It will be up to the General Assembly to mount pressure on the big powers to allow the Council to function. Unfortunately, the prospect of that too is not bright.

• IHC moved for conjugal rights of Imran Khan and his wife at Adiala Jail; security around ATC beefed up ahead of today’s hearing
RAWALPINDI: Despite repea­ted attempts by National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to interrogate PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail, officials have been unable to extract any information as he has consistently refused to meet them.
Meanwhile, a petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission for the former prime minister and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to exercise their conjugal rights while confined in the same jail.
According to sources, a three-member NCCIA team, headed by Additional Director Ayaz Khan, visited the Central Jail Adiala on Thursday for the second time during this week to question the PTI founder about his “X” handle.
However, the sources said Mr Khan told the team to bring his lawyers if they wanted to question him on any matter and refused to participate in the investigation.
The team arrived at Adiala Jail at around 3.30pm and left two hours later empty-handed amid ti­­ght security. The NCCIA launched the investigation after tweets were posted from Mr Khan’s account criticising government officials and the establishment.Earlier, on Tuesday, the same team had visited the Adiala Jail to investigate the PTI founder regarding the ope­ration of his social media account.
Plea for conjugal rights
Separately, A petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court seeking permission for the former premier Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi to exercise their conjugal rights, while confined in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi.
The petition, submitted under Article 199 of the Constitution, was filed by Shahid Yaqoob, a resident of Islamabad and a supporter of Mr Khan.
The respondents named in the petition include the Chief Commis­sioner Islamabad, the Punjab government, the Inspector General of Prisons Punjab, and the Superin­tendent of Central Jail Adiala.
The petitioner argued that denying conjugal rights violates constitutional protections, international conventions, and previous court rulings. The plea referred to the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the European Conv­e­n­­tion on Human Rights, all of which safeguard the right to family life.
It also cited a 2010 notification issued by the Sindh home department following Sup­reme Court directions, which allo­w­­ed convicted inmates conjugal visits every three months.
It furt­h­­er relied on the Federal Shariat Co­­urt’s landmark judgement that recognised conjugal rights for prisoners as a fundamental entitlement.
It requested the IHC to order the implementation of SC and Federal Shariat Court directives.
A police spokesperson said that security will be beefed up around the ATC Rawalpindi on Friday during hearing of GHQ attack case, in which the PTI founder is set to attend the proceeding via video link.

• Reiterates commitment to protecting Chinese citizens, promises ‘no red tape’ for investors
• Terms skilled workforce a ‘comparative advantage’
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and China on Thursday
vowed
to further cement bilateral trade and strategic ties, as both sides inked 21 different MoUs and joint ventures worth around $8.5 billion, besides formally launching the
second phase
of the China-Pakis­tan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.
The MoUs were signed between the two countries with regard to cooperation in the development of CPEC 2.0, science and technology, IT, media, investment, agriculture, etc.
On the last day of his
visit
to China, PM Shehbaz Sharif met his counterpart, Premier Li Qiang, and attended an investors’ conference.
According to the PM Office, PM Shehbaz and his Chinese counterpart reaffirmed to work together in a meeting that the former termed “most productive”.
“Both sides also agreed to continue working closely on the next phase of upgraded CPEC 2.0, with its five new corridors,” an official statement said.
During the meeting, the prime minister highlighted the “significant contribution” of the CPEC to  Pakistan’s socio-economic development in the past decade. He also stressed the need for early implementation of the Main Line-1 (ML-1) railway project, the Karakoram Highway realignment and operationalisation of the Gw­­adar Port.
“I also invited Chinese companies to enhance their investment footprint in Pakistan,” the PM wrote on X, adding that the leaders’ agreement on adv­ancing cooperation in information technology, agriculture, minerals, textiles and industry.
PM Shehbaz also shared Pakistan’s intent to float Panda Bonds, a type of debt security issued by foreign entities denominated in Chinese yuan (RMB), in the Chinese capital market soon.
He later met Chinese Min­ister for Information Techn­ology and Industry Li Lecheng and reiterated Pakistan’s vision of deepening bilateral cooperation with China in industries, agriculture, trade, ICT, mining and minerals.
Investors’ conference
Both countries have also agreed to deepen security and defence cooperation, and will work together to crack down on terrorism, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing a joint action plan agreed by the two countries.
PM Shehbaz later termed the security of Chinese businesses “paramount” to Pakistan, inviting investment into the country under the banner of CPEC-2.0.
Addressing Chinese business leaders at the Pak-China B2B conference, PM Shehbaz said, “I want to make it clear before this assembly of great leaders that the security of Chinese brothers and sisters in Pakistan is paramount for all of us.”
He invited them to “come forward and change the landscape of progress and welfare” for both China and Pakistan.
Noting delays in the formal launch of CPEC-2.0, PM Shehbaz assured the potential investors that “Pakistan will not tolerate even a second’s delay” in facilitating Chinese companies.
He acknowledged that there were delays, and things had not “moved forward as per Chinese standards”; however, he stressed that Pakistan’s doors remained open to Chinese investors, adding that “we will not keep them waiting even for a second”.
“I am here speaking to you first as the chief executive officer of Pakistan and then as the prime minister,” he added.
The prime minister also held a series of high-level meetings with senior executives of China’s leading enterprises in Beijing.
He also invited Chinese com­­­panies to consider Pak­i­stan as their preferred investment destination, particularly for relocating industries into special economic zones, saying that the country offered a “un­­ique comparative advantage” with a large pool of skilled and cost-effective labour, competitive input costs and strategic connectivity to regional and global markets.
After wrapping up his six-day visit, PM Shehbaz subsequently returned to Pakistan on Thursday night.

In a video statement, Gandapur said: “Imran Khan is my leader, I am loyal to him. It is my right to convey the truth to him … I made him aware of all that has been happening [during my meeting with him yesterday].”
He said that initially he was not being given the permission to meet Imran in jail and his messages were conveyed to the public only through his sisters.
“So there is a big divide in the party now,” he continued.
Gandapur said his provincial government had
presented KP’s budget
as otherwise the PTI government would have been “disqualified”. And since there were no instructions from Imran to the effect of not presenting the budget, it was presented, he added.
“But after that, campaigns that were launched declaring me and parliament traitors were highly inappropriate. And we repeatedly asked [Imran’s] sisters to bring some clarity on it but to no avail. So an impression was created that we were going against you (Imran). But it was not the case.
“And when the time came to pass the budget, the situation was same. They were not allowing us to meet (Imran). Mirza Saif was eventually able to meet him after great difficulty in which Khan
sahib
was informed of the situation …  We eventually passed the budget after making it clear to Khan
sahib
that he could make any changes he wanted.”
Gandapur also claimed that he had told Imran that he had the authority to stop them from passing the budget and they would comply.
“But my MPAs and party members were accused that we committed treachery passing this budget … They are running these campaigns.”
He said he had also been accused of applying the “minus Imran Khan” formula. “But I [told Imran] that nobody could think or have the courage to do so.”
The KP CM added that he had conveyed to the party founder that “Aleema Khan had a big role in dividing the party. Because some party members are being discredited. And the party is losing hope. That steps were not being taken for your release. Instead there is groupism in party which some people are using to serve their own interests”.
He further alleged that Aleema was in contact with “vloggers” working to create divide in the party. “And instead of stopping them … she is provoking them. And Hafeezullah Niazi
sahib
refers to Aleema Khan as the prime minister in his articles. He writes that she should become the party chairperson,” he alleged.
He alleged that campaigns were being carried out to declare Aleema the chairperson of the party. Gandapur said he told Imran that the party was being harmed by these campaigns and agendas.
“If you (Imran) want to elect a chairperson then go ahead … whoever you nominate will be acceptable but do it,” he said, referring to his conversation with Imran.
Gandapur said that petty issues were being created within the party and no work was being done on getting Imran out of jail. He alleged that instead of standing united, “our trajectory is such that complies with the objectives of the institutions and establishment, and Aleema is playing a direct role in this”.
“I clearly told him that institutions are working to weaken us … I told him that the MI was facilitating Aleema Khan in this process, according to my knowledge … It is supporting Aleema Khan in weakening us.”
Gandapur’s statement came after Aleema spoke to the media outside the Adiala Jail, where Imran is incarcerated, earlier in the day.
During the
interaction
, Aleema was asked about Gandapur’s meeting with Imran. To that, she said the KP CM had alleged during the meeting that she was working with the MI, was behind “all” the attacks directed towards Gandapur on social media and that she wanted to become the PTI chairperson.
According to Aleema Imran shared with us. “He was laughing while telling us.”
“Remember that Imran Khan is PTI’s chairman. Only he is the chairman and no one else,” she asserted. “We will do everything for Imran Khan, we will tolerate everything for him. But we will not leave him [alone] no matter what they do.”
She maintained that Imran conveyed his messages to the outside world through his family only when a party member was not available. “He also specifies what has to be told publicly and what privately.”",2025-09-30,Umar Bacha,1110,0.000143
https://www.dawn.com/news/1941414/from-jackals-to-dolphins-pakistans-wildlife-reels-under-deadly-floods,"From jackals to dolphins, Pakistan’s wildlife reels under deadly floods - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","Pakistan’s ongoing
floods
— among the deadliest in the country’s recent history — have swept away villages, submerged farmland and forced over two million people from their homes, mainly in Punjab.
The consequences, however, are not limited to humans. The catastrophic deluge has also devastated the country’s already fragile wildlife.
“Entire habitats have been submerged, encompassing everything from scrub forests and rangelands to critical wetlands that act as wildlife sanctuaries,” Rafiul Haq, a Karachi-based ecologist, told
Anadolu
.
Displaced jackals, wild boars, chinkara antelope, and even elusive jungle cats are now venturing into villages in search of food and shelter, he added.
Such encounters bring new dangers. Studies show human-wildlife conflict rises sharply after floods, and Pakistan is no exception.
“Rural areas, now burdened with displaced carnivores and omnivores, are witnessing increased attacks on livestock including goats, sheep and poultry, leading to retaliatory killings that threaten to push rare species further toward extinction,” Haq said.
Uzma Khan, a wildlife conservation specialist with the WWF-Pakistan, said fragmented habitats are weakening the resilience of local ecosystems, leaving wildlife populations more vulnerable to conflicts with humans.
“Numerous snakes have entered communities in recent days,” she said. “Many were rescued, but some, including pythons, were killed.”
She warned that floods can also spark disease outbreaks in livestock that spill over into wild populations. Stagnant water, she said, provides breeding grounds for insects that spread infections.
“This requires close monitoring and vaccination of livestock to reduce the risk of outbreaks,” she added.
Animals swept across borders
Floodwaters often carry ungulates such as sambar deer and hog deer from across the border in India into Pakistan, further straining the country’s stressed ecosystems.
“These deer, which include rare chinkara species, usually get injured after being struck by rocks and trees in the rivers, and require proper treatment before their release,” Kamran Bukhari, a senior conservator at the Punjab Wildlife Department, told
Anadolu
, adding that they are closely monitored.
So far this year, dozens of hog deer, which are classified as endangered, have been rescued, he added.
Altaf Ali Shah, a wildlife department official in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said torrential rains and glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) have displaced Himalayan ibex in Chitral district and destroyed habitats for birds, rodents, and reptiles.
Aquatic species equally hit
Experts warn that danger extends beneath the water’s surface. Fisheries and aquatic biodiversity are also under threat as floods disrupt river systems and wetlands.
Aquatic species endemic to Pakistan, including the Indus River dolphin, freshwater turtles and crocodiles, are at risk, Haq explained.
“Strong currents sweep these vulnerable creatures into irrigation canals and distributaries where chances of survival are slim,” he said. “Rescue teams often find dolphins stranded far from their river habitats — one of Pakistan’s recurring ecological tragedies.”
The Indus dolphin, locally known as “bhulan“, is found almost exclusively in Pakistan. Dwelling mainly in a 1,300-kilometre (807-mile) stretch of the Indus River, the endangered mammal is functionally blind, relying on echolocation to navigate the muddy waters.
A related species lives in the Ganges and Brahmaputra systems of India, Bangladesh and Nepal, but the Indus dolphin is genetically distinct and considered one of the world’s most endangered freshwater cetaceans.
Haq urged more coordinated rescue and conservation efforts.
Floods also bring renewal
Despite the devastation, Haq noted that the rains and floods carry a “dual nature,” sometimes boosting wildlife populations.
“Floodwaters breathe life back into arid zones,” he said. “Species like chinkara deer and wild cattle often find freshly sprouted grasses at their doorsteps after rains, potentially boosting their populations in the short term.”
Scientific studies, he added, show that periodic floods increase primary productivity in rangelands and wetlands, sparking herbivore booms and drawing migratory birds in greater numbers.
Uzma Khan of WWF-Pakistan agreed, noting that natural floods, though increasingly unpredictable under climate change, also rehabilitate habitats that support fisheries, waterfowl and endangered riverine species like hog deer.
“The most important step needed is protecting floodplains from human encroachment,” she said. “As well as linking rivers and associated lakes, which not only helps manage floods but also creates reservoirs that sustain communities as well as wildlife like waterfowl and freshwater turtles.”
She warned that unchecked leasing of land around wetlands and forests undermines natural defences.
“Protecting forests is very crucial as they shield land from the devastating impacts of cloudbursts and flash floods, which are increasing in both frequency and intensity because of climate change,” she said.
Haq said the long-term solution lies in creating wildlife corridors, restoring habitats and adopting sustainable floodplain management.
“Without that, Pakistan risks losing crucial biodiversity and the ecological safety nets that support its natural heritage and, ultimately, its people,” he said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944232/cabinet-approves-10-heavy-vehicle-inspection-facilities-across-province-to-improve-road-safety,Cabinet approves 10 heavy vehicle inspection facilities across province to improve road safety - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: The Sindh cabinet on Tuesday approved a proposal to establish 10 Heavy Vehicle Fitness Centres (HVFCs) across the province, including five in Karachi, in an effort to enhance transport safety and reduce road accidents.
The decision was taken during a cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah. It was decided that five centres would be set up in various parts of Karachi, while the remaining five would be established at divisional headquarters across Sindh.
Earlier, due to a
surge in traffic accidents
involving dumper trucks, the provincial government had made it mandatory for all heavy vehicles in Karachi to obtain a physical fitness certificate.
Senior Minister Sharjeel, who also holds the portfolio of the transport department, told Dawn that two HVFCs had already been operational in Karachi, while work was in progress to make the remaining centres operational.
He said that all commercial and private heavy vehicles, including buses, trucks, tankers, dumpers and trailers would have to obtain a physical fitness certificate.
Five centres to operate in Karachi, two of which are already functional: Sharjeel
A press statement issued by the Chief Minister House said that the facilities were set to be equipped with “advanced European testing technology, enabling thorough inspections of heavy vehicles.”
It said that the primary objectives behind this initiative were to modernise transport safety standards, decrease accident rates, and enhance adherence to existing regulations.
To bring this project to fruition, the chief minister directed the transport department to invite applications from interested and professionally capable parties.
The selection process will be merit-based, ensuring that the most suitable entity is chosen for the task.
As per the official directive, the transport department is responsible for calling for proposals from qualified entities and proceeding with the selection of a suitable partner to drive the project forward. Besides, the cabinet meeting reviewed the province’s flood situation and approved major reforms in financial management, correctional facilities, judicial processes, culture promotion, agriculture inspection, taxation reforms and road safety.
It was told that the timely mobilisation ensured control of the situation and only 17 of the 528 planned relief camps were activated, assisting 192,122 people.
The health department treated 134,240 patients at 145 medical camps, while the livestock department vaccinated 1.6 million cattle.
The cabinet also notified the newly built 200-inmate District Prison & Correctional Facility in Thatta under the Sindh Prisons & Correctional Services to reduce overcrowding.
The cabinet approved the procurement of 10 mobile testing vans worth Rs99.960m under the scheme Mobile Testing Units for Inspection, to improve calibration and spot verification of weights and measures.
To broaden the tax base, the Sindh Revenue Board was authorised to sign Memorandums of Understanding with the Federal Board of Revenue, Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited, and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for data-sharing and integration of company registration systems.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945405/ai-and-human-learning,AI and human learning - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"EDUCATIONAL institutions are grappling with the impact of Large Language Models and AI chatbots the world over.
The primary question is how does the advent of this particular technology change the way people learn, what is expected of young minds in school and universities, and what are the long-term impacts of accessing and consuming knowledge through LLMs.
The productivity impact of AI and LLMs is a separate debate and one that is already a source of much contention. Initial evaluation work shows that the technology helps raise productivity in lower level tasks, but has no discernible impact on higher-level and more complex tasks that involve multiple levels of human interface, reasoning, and analysis. It thus remains to be seen whether AI will in any way reverse the structural slowdown of growth rates that has plagued advanced capitalist economies since the late 20th century, and which the last big technological invention — the internet — failed to do in any meaningful way.
However, much like the internet, the social and cultural impact of AI is likely to be significant. I will concern myself here with its impact on one social domain: education and the fundamental task of ways and methods of learning and knowing.
From one vantage point, the early results are not encouraging. Essential aspects of learning — reading and writing — are likely to be stifled with a deepening reliance on LLMs. AI advocates frequently point out that these tools cut down the time required to do writing and reading tasks — by producing the output for you and by summarising content on particular issues. And, even as a sceptic, I have to recognise that it does this moderately well.
Merely proclaiming that devoting more time to the process of learning because of its abstract benefits isn’t necessarily a good pitch.
The problem, however, is that this approach ignores a fundamental fact about learning. Learning is not merely the quantitative production of output or the memorisation of summaries. Everything we know about it tells us that learning is a processual activity, which in turn tests and develops the ways we use our brain.
When we read text, we’re not just familiarising ourselves with the content (even if that is our primary task). The process of reading any one thing intersects with a range of thoughts, ideas, and past memories that we already have. This creates new content and new ways of understanding and thinking. The same process is in action when we sit down to write. It forces us to become clearer in our thoughts, to develop the capacity to reason and articulate, and to confront contradiction and inconsistencies that may exist in our minds. By outsourcing these tasks to an AI agent or chatbot, we remove the process part with all of its benefits, leaving behind mere output and a whole host of underutilised capacities.
Just on its own, this should be sufficient cause for scepticism and restraint, especially for children and young adults. If we equate learning with output, we run the risk of never developing essential neural capabilities in a large section of the population. But if one is looking for a more immediate reason for restraint, then the systemic hallucination problem — the creation or referencing of content that does not exist — is an important one as well. For a lot of output, AI agents may be producing passable content; but given the capacity to hallucinate, they cannot be relied on universally.
Some of these arguments that make points in general/ in the abstract are a hard sell for young people. We’re dealing with a generation that now consumes content in increasingly shorter forms (from text to video, and from video to short videos, and now finally to reels that last for a few seconds). Merely proclaiming that devoting more time to the process of learning because of its abstract benefits isn’t necessarily a good pitch.
We also don’t have the luxury of waiting for the lost value of the process to make a case for itself. The cost of the world finding out what it lost by outsourcing key aspects of the educational experience to a chatbot is far too high.
This is where institutional mechanisms and safeguards will be required. Universities and schools today are devoted to many pursuits (most of them commercial), but if they retain an interest in being organised sites of learning, they will have to place restrictions on AI use, at least in domains and stages where fundamental reading and writing skills are imparted.
At a more macroeconomic level, societies should also consider the implication of AI-reliance on two domains. The first is the obvious problem of reducing human skill and ability. Deskilled labour is replaceable, interchangeable, and ultimately discardable. It is also a fundamental erosion of the human experience.
The second domain is the prevailing quest for getting rid of human labour altogether. An obsession with AI is now the latest form of this quest. To be clear, a society where no one has to work, because of machines or technology, is a utopian ideal that remains worth pursuing. But the caveat is that this society has to be one where the gains/ outputs from such machines or technologies is shared among all.
Our societies do not feature such a model. Here the prevailing model is that any gains are appropriated by the private owners of machines and technologies. When you apply human labour-replacing technology on top of this model, you’re making humans redundant without any claim on the output (which they currently and imperfectly have in the form of a wage). The political and social implications of a large mass of redundant workers is hard to fathom at this stage, but one can assume they won’t be positive. This alone gives us a great reason to exercise restraint and rethink some key parameters of the utility and value of this technology in the long run.

graces
the calendar, commemorating the birth of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), a growing number of residents in the capital are turning to digital platforms to mark the occasion.
Across the capital, from upscale sectors to suburban communities, residents are hosting online Mahafil-i-Milad, streaming live naat sessions, and attending digital Seerat conferences.
Prominent platforms such as Zoom, Facebook Live, YouTube, and WhatsApp have become key tools for organising and participating in these spiritual events.
University students are actively conducting online naat competitions, Seerat quizzes, and live Q&A sessions with scholars — playing a proactive role in combining religious expression with modern technology.
Anam, a media student at International Islamic University Islamabad, said social media gave people the chance to make religious content more accessible, especially to younger audience.
Many mosques in Islamabad are also adapting the trend.
Some have launched daily live sessions covering Seeratun Nabi, while others have set up online donation channels to fund charitable activities during Rabiul Awwal.
Renowned Islamic scholars have taken to YouTube and Facebook to deliver special lectures, reaching thousands of viewers in real time.
Sadaf Sajid, a Qaria from Sector G-10, said Digital Milad is not a substitute but an extension of devotion.
“It allows people from different cities, even countries, to come together and celebrate the blessed month,” she said.
Joint online gatherings, where families from different cities and countries participate in collective recitations and prayers, are becoming increasingly popular.
Shireen, a resident of F-8, said her son was studying in the UK, and this was the second year they have included him in their family Milad via video call.
While physical celebrations — such as illuminating homes, distributing sweets, and attending mosque events — continue as per tradition, the rise of Digital Milad points to an evolving pattern of religious observance in Pakistan’s urban centres.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943034/two-judges-of-defunct-ihc-anti-harassment-body-express-conflicting-views,Two judges of defunct IHC anti-harassment body express conflicting views - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"• Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir argues the case fell outside workplace harassment law, should be dealt by SJC
• Justice Saman Imtiaz defends assuming jurisdiction, says courtroom is a workplace
ISLAMABAD: Two judges of the Isla­m­abad High Court (IHC) have written letters expressing conflicting views over the proceeding on the
harassment complaint
filed against the chief justice by Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, who was part of the now-defunct committee constituted to examine harassment allegations against IHC CJ Justice Sarfraz Dogar, aligned himself with the top judge, asserting that such allegations did not fall within the ambit of the workplace harassment law.
In a letter, Justice Tahir clarified that the appropriate forum to address such grievances was the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). He maintained that the competent authority had erroneously assumed jurisdiction over the matter, according to sources familiar with the development.
The letter was circulated among judges as well as the chief justice shortly after the IHC administration de-notified Justice Sa­­­­man Rafat Imtiaz as the competent authority.
In a separate letter, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz defended assuming jurisdiction and termed the courtroom a workplace.
She stated that, as the competent auth­o­r­ity under the Protection Against Haras­sment of Women at Workplace Act, she was duty-bound to entertain the complaint.
Although there was no provision for including herself in the inquiry committee constituted to probe the allegations against the chief justice—since Subsection 4 of Section 4 of the Act states: “The inquiry committee shall submit its findings and recommendations to the competent authority within thirty days of the initiation of inquiry”.
Justice Imtiaz pointed out that Subsection 2 of Section 3 states: “The committee shall consist of three members, of whom at least one member shall be a woman. One member shall be from senior management and one shall be a senior representative of the employees or a senior employee where there is no CBA.” She said that in order to meet this requirement she included herself under compelling circumstances.
The episode took a dramatic turn when the IHC administration de-notified Just­ice Imtiaz and replaced her with Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas as the competent authority.
Justice Imtiaz suggested that her successor would complete the unfinished task, reiterating her view that judges could be tried under the Act and that Article 209 did not grant them immunity from such proceedings.
Besides seeking proceedings against the top judge under the Protection Against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, Ms Mazari-Hazir had earlier also moved the Supreme Judicial Council for misconduct proceedings against Justice Dogar. She again approached the judicial council after the IHC administration removed Justice Imtiaz as the competent authority.
The complaints against CJ Dogar stem­med from a heated exchange between the lawyer and the top judge last week.
Dur­ing the hearing, Justice Dogar had warned Ms Mazari-Hazir of a contempt of court case and was reported to have made remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”.

Gulbar Khan
, lost the basic membership of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) for making a forward bloc and voting against the party policy, according to the termination letters issued to them.
Besides CM Khan, members of GB Legislative Assembly Surayya Zaman, Shamsul Haq Lone, Raja Nasir Khan Maqpoon, Raja Azam Khan Amacha, Syed Amjad Zaidi, Mushtaq Ahmad, Haji Shah Baig, Dilshad Bano, Abdul Hameed and Fazal Rahim were given formal termination notices, all containing identical wording.
“This letter serves as formal notice of termination of your membership, effective immediately. This decision has been made in accordance with party’s policy and procedures. The reason for this termination is your actions in the GB Assembly, specifically making a forward bloc and voting against the party decision, which is a clear violation of our party’s policy.
“Your actions have caused harm to the party’s interests and reputation,” stated the letters issued by Additional Secretary General of PTI Firdous Shamim Naqvi.
Party announces complete support for strike in Balochistan against lawlessness
All the 11 lawmakers were directed to “refrain from using party’s [PTI] name, designation and/or membership in any manner or whatsoever, failing which the party reserves to take action against you which may also lead to legal action,” the letters stated.
However, according to a party insider, the issuance of letters may not make any difference to them, as the “whole system” was allegedly backing them.
Also, the PTI issued a show-cause notice to former GB governor Raja Jalal Hussain Maqpoon, according to
Dawn.com
. The notice, dated Sept 5, said it had come to PTI’s notice that Mr Maqpoon had “conspired against the party and approached party members for defection”.
“In view of these reported activities, you are hereby called to explain yourself in writing within two days of this notice. If your reply is unsatisfactory or you do not respond, further action will be taken as per party policy and rules,” it added.
Backs strike in Balochistan
Meanwhile, acting on the direction of PTI founder Imran Khan, the PTI announced complete support for the wheel-jam and shutter-down
strike
in Balochistan on Monday against escalating lawlessness, rising terrorism, and the government’s failure to protect citizens.
The call for province-wide strike was given by a six-party opposition alliance comprising Balo­chistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), Pasht­unkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Awami National Party (ANP), National Party (NP), and Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen (MWM).
A statement from PTI’s central media department explained that the coalition had announced the joint protest against the recent attack at Shahwani Stadium on BNP-M rally, which claimed several precious lives and left many others injured. It emphasised that the strike was intended not only to mourn the victims of the tragedy but also to expose the government’s abject failure to provide security to its citizens.
The PTI warned that militancy and extremism were witnessing an alarming resurgence in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and other parts of the country due to government’s policies and priorities.
“PTI strongly believes that the people’s voice cannot be suppressed by terrorism, state oppression, or the use of coercive force. Our democratic struggle for peace, justice, and fundamental rights will not only continue but will be pursued with renewed determination and even greater resolve,” it stated.
On the other side, the PTI extended felicitations to the nation on Pakistan Air Force Day. It stated, “September 7 stands as a symbol of the unmatched bravery, sacrifice, and valour demonstrated by the Pakistan Air Force in the defence of our homeland.
On this day, we pay tribute to the martyrs who laid down their lives to safeguard the nation’s sovereignty.”

A first information report (FIR) was filed at the Saddar Bairooni Police Station today on the complaint of Supreme Court Press Association President Tayyab Baloch under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 382 (theft after preparation made causing death, hurt or restraint in order to committing of the theft), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Baloch said that he was present outside Adiala Jail at around 3:55pm for reporting with other journalists when Aleema and other people began a media talk after a hearing for the Toshakhana case.
“During this time, a person named Naeem Panjutha called out: ‘Teach him a lesson for questioning Aleema about properties,’” Baloch said, adding that 35-40 people there grabbed him at that, laid him down and began beating him.
“During this time, some unknown person snatched my mobile phone from me and also broke my microphone,” he said, adding that other reporters there who tried to rescue him were also beaten up.
“We barely escaped them after much pleading. The reason is that I had previously asked Aleema Khan about purchasing properties in America as a journalist, which made her uncomfortable. On which, Aleema Khan, through his workers, first posted pictures of me … [and others] on social media and spread rumours against us. Today, as per the pre-arranged plan, they attacked me, beat me up, forcibly snatched my mobile and threatened to kill me, along with breaking my microphone.”
He requested legal proceedings against Aleema, Panjutha and the other suspects.
In reponse, Panjutha termed the FIR a “fake case” against him and Aleema.
Slamming the incident, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Baloch was targeted with violence “solely and only because of a difference of opinion, which is unacceptable”.
He said strict action would be taken and vowed to give his full support.
PPP leaders such as Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Nadeem Afzal Chan and Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab also condemned the incident.
Karachi Press Club President Fazil Jamili said the incident was both “unfortunate and condemnable”. He added that “this new trend will not end unless political parties actively discourage it. We must remember that politics and journalism rise & fall together.”",2025-09-08,Tahir Naseer,653,0.000109

Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with ties that span various sectors, including trade, energy, defence, and infrastructure. PM Shehbaz is currently on a six-day visit to China, where he attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)
summit
held from August 31-September 1.
“Both sides also agreed to continue working closely on the next phase of upgraded CPEC 2.0, with its five new corridors,” said a
statement
today by the Press Information Department (PID) following the meeting in Beijing.
The prime minister highlighted the “significant contribution” of the CPEC in Pakistan’s socio-economic development in the past decade. He also stressed the need for early implementation of the
Main Line-1
(ML-1) railway project, the Karakoram Highway
realignment
and operationalisation of the
Gwadar Port
.
In a post on X, PM Shehbaz termed the meeting “warm and most productive”.
“I also invited Chinese companies to enhance their investment footprint in Pakistan,” the premier said, noting the leaders’ agreement on advancing cooperation in information technology, agriculture, minerals, textiles and industry.
PM Shehbaz said: “I thanked the Chinese leadership & the people for their steadfast support to Pakistan’s socio-economic development, particularly through the successful implementation of CPEC, which was now entering its next phase.
“Inspired by President Xi Jinping’s visionary leadership, we remain committed to building a stronger Pakistan-China community with a shared future,” he added.
The PID statement noted the meeting was “warm and friendly”, with both leaders expressing their satisfaction at the positive trajectory of Pak-China relations.
PM Shehbaz expressed his “deepest gratitude to the Chinese leadership and nation for their unflinching support to Pakistan’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, and socio-economic development”.
Both leaders also attended the ceremony of sharing of MoUs and agreements signed related to the “development of CPEC 2.0, science and technology, IT, media, agriculture, etc”.
Recalling the “important consensus” reached between PM Shehbaz and President Xi Jinping in their
Tuesday meeting
, the statement noted that both premiers reaffirmed their “shared resolve to further strengthen the iron-clad, all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between Pakistan and China”.
“The signing of the Joint Action Plan 2024-2029 was deemed as an important step in this regard.”
The prime minister asserted that the government’s “tireless reform efforts were yielding promising results, made possible through China’s strong support”. In June, China
rolled over
$3.4 billion in loans to Pakistan to help boost Islamabad’s foreign exchange reserves.
PM Shehbaz also shared Pakistan’s intent to float
Panda Bonds
, a type of debt security issued by foreign entities denominated in Chinese yuan (RMB), in the Chinese capital market soon.
The prime minister briefed the Chinese premier on the Pakistan-China Business-to-Business Investment Conference held earlier today, where “more than 300 Pakistani and 500 Chinese companies were in attendance”.
He stressed the vast potential for B2B cooperation and investment, identifying agriculture, mines and minerals, textile, industrial sector and IT as priority areas for mutually beneficial economic collaboration.
PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s support for President Xi’s landmark initiatives to strengthen multilateralism, including the Global Governance Initiative, Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilisation Initiative.
The delegation-level talks were followed by a sumptuous luncheon, hosted by Premier Li in honour of PM Shehbaz and his team, PID added. Both countries would celebrate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Pak-China diplomatic ties next year, it noted.
The premier’s ongoing visit was expected to mark the formal
launch
of the second phase of the CPEC-II, which focuses on industrial cooperation.
PM Shehbaz later met Chinese Minister for Information Technology and Industry Li Lecheng and reiterated Pakistan’s vision of deepening bilateral cooperation with China in industries, agriculture, trade, ICT, mining and minerals.
PM Shehbaz hailed CPEC as a central pillar of Pakistan’s socio-economic development and expressed satisfaction at its steady progress in its second phase.
Admiring the government’s economic reform agenda, Minister Li emphasised that China regarded Pakistan as an “ironclad brother and All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partner”.
He expressed China’s firm resolve to elevate bilateral relations to “new heights of cooperation and collaboration”.
The prime minister also held a series of high-level meetings with senior executives of China’s leading enterprises in Beijing.
He emphasised that industrial cooperation was the cornerstone of Pakistan-China economic cooperation and a “defining pillar” of CPEC’s development in its second phase.
He also invited Chinese companies to consider Pakistan as their preferred investment destination, particularly for relocating industries into special economic zones, saying that the country offered a “unique comparative advantage” with a large pool of skilled and cost-effective labour, competitive input costs and strategic connectivity to regional and global markets.
PM Shehbaz pledges security assurance to Chinese investors, terms it ‘paramount’
PM Shehbaz later termed the security of Chinese businesses “paramount” to Pakistan, inviting investment into the country under the banner of CPEC-2.0.
Addressing Chinese business leaders at the Pak-China B2B conference, PM Shehbaz said, “I want to make it clear before this assembly of great leaders that the security of Chinese brothers and sisters in Pakistan is paramount for all of us.”
He invited them to “come forward and change the landscape of progress and welfare” for both China and Pakistan.
Noting delays in the formal launch of CPEC-2.0, PM Shehbaz assured the potential investors that “Pakistan will not tolerate even a second’s delay” in facilitating Chinese companies.
He acknowledged that there were delays, and things had not “moved forward as per Chinese standards”; however, he stressed that Pakistan’s doors remained open to Chinese investors, adding that “we will not keep them waiting even for a second”.
The premier lauded CPEC-2.0 as a “win-win” equation for both Pakistan and China. Marking the formal launch of CPEC-2.0, he outlined B2B investment, agriculture, trade, IT, mines and minerals, and the establishment of SEZs as the main pillars of the second phase.
He added that Pakistan could fulfil China’s need for labour, suggesting that industries such as textiles, leather, among others, could be shifted to Pakistan. He recommended that the country could also produce those goods and services for China.
“This is the total crux of CPEC-2.0,” he said, noting that “if our economy strengthens, everything will fall into place”.
“I am here speaking to you first as the chief executive officer of Pakistan and then as the prime minister,” he added.
Thanking China and President Xi for their economic support, he noted that Pakistan’s economy was stable now because of it.
“Pakistan’s macro indicators continue to show progress, in the short, medium and long term,” the premier said, adding that recent progress was made due to the Chinese president’s “commitment towards Pakistan”.
He said that Pakistan was “now ready to compete with other countries in this race of economic development” with Chinese cooperation.
He and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal also witnessed the signing of 21 MoUs between business firms from Pakistan and China.
On Tuesday, at the sidelines of the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz and President Xi reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening their “iron-clad and all-weather strategic cooperative partnership”.
In his meeting with the prime minister, President Xi pledged support for Pakistan’s home-grown capacity for development, expressing readiness to build CPEC 2.0 and upgrade the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement, and step up cooperation in industries, agriculture, and mining sectors.
PM Shehbaz had stressed the “significance of the CPEC as a flagship project of President Xi’s
Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) to help both countries to build an even stronger Pakistan-China community with a shared future”.
During his
recent address
at Tianjin University, PM Shehbaz reiterated that all endeavours and initiatives of the current government of Pakistan “closely align with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s vision and philosophy”.

The decision comes as the country is facing catastrophic
floods
, which have inundated thousands of villages and displaced millions in Punjab, with flood water now expected to move downstream towards Sindh.
According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Health, “After holding discussions with relevant representatives from all four provinces, AJK (Azad Jammu and Kashmir) and Gilgit-Baltistan, on the instructions of Health Minister Mustafa Kamal, the PMDC has revised the exam date to October 26 (Sunday).”
The PMDC is the national statutory organisation responsible for regulating the standards of medical and dental education throughout the country.
The decision was taken in light of the “difficulties faced by students in the affected areas,“ the statement read.
The exam was previously scheduled to be held on October 5.
The “decision is in the larger interest of the students,” the statement quoted Health Minister Mustafa Kamal as saying.
“The government is committed to providing equal educational opportunities to every student in the country,” he added.
The exam, which in previous years has been marred by
delays
, is the entry requirement for admission to medical and dental colleges across Pakistan.
Each year, approximately 200,000 candidates take the MDCAT.

The petition, a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
, named the NCCIA director, deputy director and inspector from Lahore as well as the director general from Islamabad as respondents in the case.
The petitioners were named as Ansari, Sheikh Mujahid Latif, Sheraz Nisar, Ahmed Faraz, Yasir Shamoon and Waseem Sabir.
According to the petition, the journalists’ professional duty was to cover criminal cases and highlight issues and defects in the police administration. Further, it said that the petitioners had criticised the formation of the Crime Control Department, the appointment of Lahore Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Faisal Kamran without merit and the increasing crime rate in Lahore.
The journalists contended that this prompted DIG Kamran to “launch malicious social media campaigns against petitioners through retired police officials”.
It stated that on September 18, a “premeditated complaint based on false and fabricated contents” was submitted to the NCCIA to “defame” the petitioners. It said that later first and second notices were issued by the NCCIA deputy director to the journalists for personal appearance.
The petitioners argued that the first notice was issued on September 20 and the second on September 24, with a directive to appear the very next day on September 25.
“The gap between both notices is three to four days, which shows misuse of power/authority just to malign [the] petitioners,” the petition said.
“Powers are being misused by [the] respondents [and] notices are being sent, maliciously motivated by [the] desires of others just to malign journalists,” the petition added.
“[These] notices are illegal and unlawful [and] no rules have been made yet for [the] check and balance of [the] notices mechanism with [a] duration or gap between notices. Serving Notices at [the] desire of higher authorities to malign journalists is clearly mala fide [on the] part of [the] investigating officer,” said.
The petitioners requested that the LHC quash the NCCIA’s initial September 18 notice as it was “illegal, unlawful and void ab initio”. They also called on the court to suspend the operation of the September 18 notice till the petition was decided.",2025-09-25,Rana Bilal,605,0.000105

The Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs Division also called for the blacklisting of a joint venture (JV) of three firms — M/s Ningxia Communications Construction Co., Ltd NXCC, M/s Dynamic Constructors, and M/s Rustam Associates.
The committee called on the NHA to write to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the project financier, within two days regarding the firms’ non-compliance and the fraudulent nature of the bids.
It further recommended that the Economic Affairs Division officially notify the ADB that the bids were “technically invalid and were manipulated due to the malafide intentions of NHA officials and the contractors.”
Committee shocked by NHA revelation that companies have refused to provide relevant documents, terms bid papers ‘forged’
The committee declared the bids null and void, concluding that documents submitted by the auditors were “fraudulent and unverified” and that due process was not followed.
The committee noted that the lead partner, NXCC, had previously been disqualified from two other ADB-funded projects, including CAREC Trance-II, but was still deemed qualified for Tranche-III.
It also criticised the NHA for awarding the contracts to a company with a history of disqualification and for what it called persistent non-cooperation with the parliamentary investigation.
According to an official statement, issued by the Senate Secretariat, NHA officials told the committee that letters had been sent to all firms, but they had refused to provide the required documents.The committee was shocked to learn that the firms had sent their responses to their auditors instead of directly to the NHA.
“The NHA has failed to submit the required documents to date, despite  a commitment made by the CEO, NHA, in the last meeting to provide them  within two days,” he added.
After extensive deliberations, the committee concluded that NHA failed to provide the required documents. The auditor of the local firms admitted that they did not have the documents, and both contractors also refused to provide them.

Sources said that the procedure was successfully performed by experts of the livestock and fisheries department — a second such procedure in recent months.
The experts included Dr Shalla Hayat, Dr Muhammad Ali Ayaz, Dr Javed Khoso, Dr Zulfiqar Haider Otto and Dr Muhammad Ali Gopang. The disease investigation was carried out by Dr Abdul Manan Khokhar, who is also the government focal person.
The 18-month-old camel — now affectionately named Chandni — is currently being kept under 24-hour observation at the Comprehensive Disaster Response Services (CDRS) shelter home, located in the Murad Memon goth.
A separate unit has been created at the facility to meet her intensive health needs. Officials say Chandni is recovering.
Female camel’s right hind leg surgically removed ‘to prevent infection’
Sources said her post-operation blood tests showed presence of a potentially life-threatening blood parasitic infection that had caused a significant drop in her haemoglobin level. This situation, they said, forced the medical board — constituted by the provincial government for her care — to consider treatment options that would minimise blood loss.
“The team had to amputate her right hind leg as there was no sensation in her limb. Second, it was a strategy to help prevent the spread of the infection that’s still being treated,” an official told
Dawn.
He added that her multiple jaw injuries were attended to through “bone pinning techniques” — a surgical method in which a metal pin is inserted into the centre of the broken bone to hold the pieces in place when they heal.
According to her post-operation report, a copy of which is available with
Dawn
, “Both procedures were performed under local and dissociative anaesthesia. Both surgeries were bloodless and painless. The animal female camel Chandni is now out of danger and in complete senses,” it says.
The medical team reaffirms that the animal will be able to swallow food within two days and eat solid food within three to five weeks. Now the focus is on her health stability and vital control, it adds.
Sources said Chandni’s complete recovery was expected in two months, after which the team would reassess her condition and plan to fit a prosthetic limb.
Meanwhile, the chief minister has directed the officials concerned to ensure good care of Chandni until she fully recovers.
“Till she heals, experts in making artificial limbs should be consulted,” a statement released by CM House says.
It might be recalled that Chandni, earlier named Sumi, was
“punished”
for drinking water from a pond in a landlord’s field in Sukkur. The camel was later brought to the CDRS shelter in Karachi for treatment.
The poor camel had been battling multiple life-threatening injuries, including a crushed leg and multiple jaw fractures.
The police have claimed to have arrested two of the three suspects allegedly involved in the torture reported in the Januji area in taluka Salehpat, Sukkur.
According to the complainant, when his camels were returning after drinking water from a pond, one of the suspects hit one of the camels with an axe, breaking its leg. Then he dragged the camel with his tractor. The complainant said he kept pleading with the suspects to spare the camel, but they did not listen to him. According to the FIR, the suspects reacted angrily, saying that the camel had “destroyed their crops”.
Earlier, Cammie, another female camel, suffered a similar brutality in Sanghar as punishment for foraging in a landlord’s field.
She was able to
stand
on her feet with the help of a prosthetic leg following a major surgery in July this year.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1633999,HISTORY: WHERE WAS JINNAH BORN? - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"It is widely believed that Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah was born in Karachi. But some local oral traditions say that he was born in Jherruck, a town in present-day Thatta district of Sindh. The proponents of the latter opinion point to a textbook published in Sindh in the 1950s to support their contention, which mentions that the Quaid-i-Azam was, indeed, born in Jherruck.
This controversy has been going on for a long time. Several attempts were made in the past by various authorities, including Syed Abdullah Shah — when he was serving as the provincial chief minister — as well as the district government of Thatta, who constituted committees to ascertain the facts of this claim. But it was all in vain.
While compiling a biography of Jinnah, I too confronted the same question and decided to approach the matter from three different angles, i.e., documentary evidence, personal statements of the Quaid-i-Azam on the subject and accounts rendered by his family members. Here is the outcome of the exercise. But before we proceed further, let’s briefly outline his family background as well as the two geographical entities involved in the issue, Jherruck and Karachi, as they existed at the time of his birth.
Family Background
The Quaid-i-Azam’s ancestors belonged to a village called Paneli in the princely state of Gondal in the Kathiawar region. His paternal grandfather, Poonjabhai, ran a business relating to weaving of coarse cloth in the village. He had four children: a daughter, Manbai, and three sons, Valibhai, Nathoobhai and Jinnahbhai. The youngest son, Jinnahbhai, who was born around 1850, left Paneli and established his business in Gondal town. In 1874, his parents married him off to Mithbai, a girl from their community. Finding Gondal too small for his ambitions, Jinnahbhai decided to move westward, to Sindh, which was emerging as a new centre of trade and commerce after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.
An economic hub - Jherruck
Jherruck was basically a riverine port located on the Indus, about 100 kilometres from Karachi. In the absence of a viable road and rail network in the region, the British introduced an elaborate navigational system, the ‘Indus Flotilla’, with operational headquarters at Jherruck. This place offered tremendous opportunities related to trade and commerce, and attracted enterprising people from far and wide.
The controversy around Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s actual birthplace — Karachi or Jherruck — has lingered for many years. We may finally have a definitive answer
The importance of Jherruck can be gauged from the fact that Prince Hassanally, the Aga Khan I, built his house there in 1843, which still stands today. The British established a school there in 1870, five years before Sir Syed Ahmed Khan established his Aligarh institute. Describing Jherruck in 1861, George Bease wrote in Sind Directory: “Sir Charles Napier regretted that he had not chosen it [Jherruck] for the European barracks instead of Hyderabad.”
Karachi - an agreeable climate for Europeans
Though Karachi existed as a small settlement for a long time, it was during the British rule that it evolved into a modern city and a great seaport. The British found it suitable for their living. In the words of Bease: “The climate seems to agree well with Europeans, the average mortality being much less than any station in the Northwest provinces.”
The opening of the Suez Canal further increased Karachi’s significance, as it became British India’s closest port to Europe. In addition to that, the route through Sindh provided an easier access to Punjab, northern India and Afghanistan.
In view of the tremendous opportunities of growth, Jinnabhai moved to Karachi in the 1870s and established his business. However, there are two points of view here. One says that Jinnabhai directly came from Gondal to Karachi. The other says that he and his family stayed for a few years at Jherruck, where the Quaid-i-Azam was born and received his early education, before coming to Karachi.
Documentary Evidence
School records are considered the most authentic documentary evidence regarding a person’s birthplace. In the case of the Quaid-i-Azam, four of his school records are available to us: three at Sindh Madressatul Islam University, and one at the Church Mission School (CMS). As per these records, Jinnah’s first admission took place on July 4, 1887 at Sindh Madressatul Islam; this has been recorded in the General Register on page 7, serial number 114. Here, ‘Karachi’ has been clearly mentioned as his ‘native place’ in front of his name.
The second and third admission records also relate to his subsequent admissions at Sindh Madressatul Islam, as he was readmitted twice during a span of about four and a half years, from 1887 to 1892. The reason for his multiple admissions there was his travels to Bombay to meet his favourite aunt.
In all these records, recorded at serial numbers 178 and 430, Karachi is mentioned as his native place. His fourth school record relates to his admission in CMS in March 1892, which he took after leaving Sindh Madressatul Islam. He studied there for about seven months until October, before leaving for England. There, too, Karachi has been mentioned as his place of birth.
With such clear mention of Karachi as his birthplace in school records, the controversy should have ended there. But there was a caveat: Jherruck itself was part of Karachi district in those days. Many people in those days, like today, mentioned the names of bigger towns or district headquarters in official documents, instead of giving the exact name of their village or town!
A closer examination of the page recording Jinnah’s first admission at Sindh Madressatul Islam reveals, however, that just above his name, the entry for the student with Serial No. 113, who was also admitted on the same day, i.e., July 4, 1887, mentions “Jherruck” as his native place, while the entry relating to Jinnah says Karachi as his birthplace. If the Quaid-i-Azam had indeed been born in Jherruck, it is unlikely that Karachi would have been mentioned as his birthplace, particularly when the entry just above records Jherruck as another student’s birthplace.
Personal Statements
Next, we move to the Quaid-i-Azam’s own statements because, in matters like this, a person’s own testimony has great value. It is on record that the Quaid-i-Azam mentioned Karachi as his birthplace many times. One such occasion was the Sindh provincial Muslim League Conference held at Karachi on October 7, 1938. While delivering the presidential address, he described Karachi as well as his association with it:
“While speaking in this great city and capital of Sindh, Karachi, with the magnificent position that it occupies, the wonderful seaport and constituting as it does the first homeland for Mussalmans, it gives me no small pleasure that I should preside over a conference the likes of which have never before been seen in Sindh.  You can well imagine my surging emotions when I tell you that Karachi is my birthplace, and I cannot adequately express how deeply anxious I am for its welfare.”
Another occasion when he mentioned Karachi as his birthplace was in his letter dated April 30, 1946, addressed to an astrologer of Daily Anjam, who had requested him to provide the exact time, date and place of his birth for preparing his horoscope. In his reply, Quaid-i-Azam mentioned the time of his birth as ‘early morning’, date ‘25th December 1876’ and place ‘Karachi.’
Here it is also interesting to note that, during his entire life of about 72 years, the Quaid-i-Azam neither ever mentioned Jherruck as his birthplace nor visited it even once.
Family Accounts
Yet another source of information about such matters is the accounts rendered by his family members and contemporaries. The closest to him, amongst his family members, was his sister Fatima Jinnah. She authored a book detailing his biography, titled My Brother. She candidly mentioned that their parents had shifted to Karachi in the 1870s from Gondal, and that the Quaid-i-Azam was born in Karachi.
Conclusion
The textbook passage, it seems, was based on hearsay. Another piece of information given in the same passage is that the Quaid-i-Azam passed his matriculation examination from Sindh Madressatul Islam. The fact is that the Quaid-i-Azam left Sindh Madressatul Islam while studying in fifth class — which was two years short of matriculation. Factual errors like this make the textbook passage an unreliable source of information.
Hence, the controversy over the issue of the Quaid-i-Azam’s birthplace, based on an old textbook passage, should be resolved, once and for all.

Senior officials of the police told
Dawn
on Tuesday that action had been taken against two sub-inspectors and three constables of the CTD after a departmental inquiry found them “guilty” in the incident of kidnapping an Afghan businessman and later releasing him after receiving money.
Giving details, they said the dismissed officials had raided a business centre of the Afghan national located in Blue Area few weeks ago.
During the search operation, the team recovered huge amount from the centre and arrested the Afghan national, who remained under “illegal detention” at the CTD building for few hours.
Another foreigner ‘looted’ in Kohsar police jurisdiction
Later, they said, the arrested man was released after receiving extortion money. The CTD men had demanded cash in exchange for the businessman’s freedom, threatening to fabricate a case against him if he didn’t comply.
After his release from the captivity, the victim brought the matter into the notice of senior police officials who directed the concerned CTD officer to conduct an inquiry.
During the inquiry, the CTD officials were found guilty and they were asked to return the money to the businessman.
However, they failed to return the whole amount as they had already spent some of the money.
On the basis of the inquiry, they said, all the five personnel were dismissed from the service.
Sources in the police told
Dawn
that in another incident, a foreign national complained to the senior police officers that some police personnel in uniform allegedly raided his house located in the area of Kohsar police station and took away millions of rupees.
They said that a police team had raided the house on reports that the foreigner was involved in some financial scams, including skimming.
After the incident, the foreigner contacted the senior police officials and informed them about the incident, terming it as “robbery”.
In this case too, the sources said, the CTD officials had been asked to return the “looted amount” to the foreigner. The police personnel, the sources said, returned most of the amount to the foreigner on the condition that the man would not initiate any legal action against the police officers.
When contacted, Deputy Inspector General of Police (Operations) Jawad Tariq confirmed the first incident, stating that the CTD officials were found guilty and they had been dismissed from the service.
The DIG said whenever they received any complaint about the involvement of police personnel in some illegal activities, an inquiry was ordered and strict action was taken against those found involved in such activities.
He, however, did not talk about the second incident.

Earlier, a senior police officer in the area told
AFP
on condition of anonymity that “jets targeted four houses, which were completely destroyed”. He, however, did not say who carried out the attack. The incident generated criticism from multiple quarters.
A statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Secretariat said CM Ali Amin Gandapur met a delegation from the district following the incident with PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi, the KP chief secretary, additional chief secretary (home), Peshawar commissioner and other officials also present in the meeting that reviewed the law and order situation in the “context of the unfortunate incident” that occurred in Tirah.
“Martyrdom of civilians in the incident is regrettable and condemnable. Martyrdom of civilians as a result of operations against terrorists is unacceptable,” the statement quoted CM Gandapur as saying.
It added that regret was expressed over the unfortunate incident in the meeting, and prayers were offered for the deceased as well.
The statement said the chief minister announced compensation of Rs10 million each for the families of the victims. The session also held a detailed consideration of an action plan to prevent such incidents in the future.
“In this regard, it was decided to hold a meeting of the jirga consisting of elected public representatives of the area, leaders of all political parties, and local elders with top military officials.
“The future course of action for peace and order in the area will be decided in the meeting of the jirga with military officials,” the statement said, adding that an agreement was reached to adopt a strategy in Tirah to establish peace and order on the model of Bajaur.
During the meeting, special emphasis was laid on the need to gain the trust of locals and residents for peace in the area, the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said it was “deeply shocked” to hear about reports of the killing of several civilians caused by alleged “aerial bombing” in Tirah, and demanded a probe into the matter.
It demanded that “the authorities carry out an immediate and impartial inquiry into the incident and hold to account those responsible”.
“The state is constitutionally bound to protect all civilians’ right to life, which it has repeatedly failed to secure,” the HRCP statement read.
KP Assembly Speaker Babar Swati called on the federal and provincial governments to conduct a “transparent and immediate investigation into the incident, identify those responsible, and not only provide immediate relief and compensation to the affected families but also take comprehensive measures for their rehabilitation”.
A statement uploaded on his X account said he expressed his sorrow over the “martyrdom of innocent civilians and the destruction of homes due to the bombardment by jet aircraft”.
Special Assistant to the Chief Minister for Communication and Works Sohail Afridi also raised his voice on the matter during today’s KP Assembly session. He said the “horrifying tragedy” occurred at 2am in Tirah.
He alleged that 25 people, including women and children, were killed when “mortar and bombs were dropped” on the locals. He blamed the security forces for the incident. It, however, could not be independently established as to who was responsible.
MNA Iqbal earlier expressed sorrow over the incident in a video message in Pashto, which he shared with the media. He said elderly women and children were killed in “shelling by jets” in Tirah and urged the people to reach the site of the incident to protest the killings.
The MNA said it was not the first time that such an incident had taken place. “The killing of civilians has become a routine.”
In a similar incident in May, 22 people, including seven children, were injured in an
alleged quadcopter strike
in the Wana tehsil of KP’s South Waziristan district.
That same month, four children were
killed
and five others were injured in a suspected quadcopter munitions drop in Mir Ali tehsil of the North Waziristan district in KP.
Later, the military
clarified
that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

The controversy had surfaced when photos from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s
address
at a UN Security Council session on artificial intelligence (AI) spread like wildfire on social media platform X, with users pointing to Junejo sitting in the background. Several of them also
shared
screenshots from her Twitter (now X) timeline from several years ago, expressing support for Israel — a position sharply at odds with Pakistan’s longstanding pro-Palestinian stance.
After social media furore, Asif
said
on X that only the Foreign Office could explain Junejo’s presence at the session. Later, the FO clarified that she had not been part of Pakistan’s accredited delegation.
Following that, Asif also
spoke about the matter
on
Geo News
programme ‘Naya Pakistan’. Asked whether he was “taken aback” by the FO’s statement, Asif emphatically said: “I was taken aback, rather I was a bit disturbed that such people could be with the delegation whom no one owns later.” He also denied Junejo having written PM Shehbaz’s speech for the 80th UN General Assembly session, further stating that as far as he knew, she did not have any official position, be it of an adviser or a special assistant.
However, Junejo claimed in a post on X today that she had been working for the prime minister for the past many months.
“My policy briefs, advice and points during the
Pakistan-India escalation
are all part of the record and preserved,” she said, further claiming that the premier had assigned her the task of “writing the UN speech”.
The London-based social media activist went on to claim that the PM himself had included her in the UN delegation as an adviser and that she was also issued a security pass.
“I worked with his team day and night. I travelled with him, stayed with his team in the same hotel and was also a part of his important meetings on the sidelines (of the UNGA session), such as the one with Bill Gates,” she said, adding that in another conference on climate on the UNGA sidelines, she was sitting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar behind the prime minister.
According to Junejo, after the session on climate, the protocol team escorted her to the session on AI, where she sat behind Asif alongside a man she identified as Bilal. In her post, she also shared a picture of herself with Asif and Pakistan Crypto Council Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib, as well as that of her UN card.
Junejo maintained that at the AI conference, Bilal continued to write a new speech and “we had tea together afterwards”.
“We sat together for 40 minutes waiting for the car, and returned to the hotel together in the same car. Khawaja Asif
sahib
sat with me on the backseat of the car,” she maintained.
Junejo claimed that she was also at the UN “with the others” when PM Shehbaz was delivering his speech. “There, Khawaja Asif was sitting in front of me, and we all applauded together for the prime minister.”
According to her, the PM’s “historic speech was not only written by her, but it was teamwork”. Junejo had
claimed
about being a part of the minister’s speech-writing team since April earlier as well.
In her post today, she claimed that her return flight was also booked beforehand, and the mission protocol team had dropped her at the airport.
She questioned, “Why is Khawaja Asif
sahib
issuing such statements now and under what agenda is he tarnishing a historic visit of his government?”
“The prime minister should ask him about this, as his authority has been challenged, not mine.”
In a similar post on X in English, she said Asif’s statements and the FO’s post “
have embarrassed Pakistan globally“.
She added, “If anyone attempts to malign my character or professional integrity, I reserve the right to pursue legal action in the UK.”
Minister passes the buck, FO distances itself
When the controversy had initially surfaced, Asif, facing a barrage of criticism, publicly distanced himself from Junejo’s appearance with the delegation and pointed the finger at the FO.
In a post on X, the defence minister had clarified that he had given the speech instead of PM Shehbaz at the UNSC session as the latter had other engagements.
“This woman or whoever sat behind me was and is at the discretion of the Foreign Office,” Asif said. “Who is this woman? Why is she with the delegation, and why was she seated behind me? Only the FO can answer these questions. It is not appropriate for me to respond on their behalf.”
Subsequently, the FO issued a clarification, stating: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has noted queries regarding the seating of a certain individual behind the defence minister at a recent meeting of the UNSC.
“To clarify, the individual in question was not listed in the official letter of credence for the Pakistan delegation to the 80th UNGA session, signed by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister.
“As such, her seating behind the defence minister did not have the approval of the deputy prime minister/ foreign minister.”
Official sources
confirmed
to
Dawn
that while the FO did not issue the required letter of credence, Junejo joined PM Shehbaz’s entourage from Britain, where she had been staying at the same hotel.
On arrival in New York, Pakistan’s mission to the UN was directed by “a senior political leader” to issue a note verbale for facilitating her accreditation so that she could attend meetings, including the UNSC debate, the
Dawn
report said.
It added that the leader’s argument was that though she wasn’t part of the official delegation notified by FO for the session, she was part of the entourage. Therefore, the mission was asked to get her accredited.
A source categorically told
Dawn
that the FO did not even have prior knowledge about Junejo’s inclusion in the entourage.
Junejo clarifies stance on Israel
Meanwhile, Junejo has also posted about her stance on Israel.
In a post on X today, she said that an impression of her being pro-Israel was created on the basis of a 2018 post on X. “Whereas, I have been writing against the massacre in Gaza and Netanyahu almost daily since 2023. But nobody sees that.”
She said her statements about Pakistan recognising Israel were given during Abraham Accords — a set of agreements that normalised ties between Israel and multiple Arab states — and that she had always condemned Israel’s atrocities since its invasion of Gaza. “I will keep doing so,” she added, referring to a video of Pakistani delegates walking out during the recent UNGA session.
At the UNGA, delegates from several countries had walked out, boycotting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech.
Earlier, Junejo had shared screenshots on X of previous posts where she had called out Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
The
Dawn
report from yesterday mentions that in her social media posts from London, Junejo had also said she was in possession of the ‘secret files’ raising questions about the security of such documents.
Junejo, in a post on X, also appeared to be clarifying this matter. She said: “There was a fire incident at the Churchill Hotel which left me panicked. I am disabled and was not assisted during evacuation. I carried hard copies of speech drafts and meeting notes — my personal intellectual property. These were sensitive but not state documents. I held no access to or custody of any official files beyond my remit.”",2025-09-28,Dawn.com,1903,0.000203

Radio Pakistan
reported
.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) earlier said that 12 soldiers were martyred while security forces killed 13 terrorists during an intense fire exchange in KP’s South Waziristan district. It added that the 13 terrorists were among 35 “
khwarij
belonging to Indian proxy
Fitna al Khwarij
” killed in two separate engagements from September 10 to 13. It later said seven more soldiers were martyred and 10 more terrorists were killed on Thursday in Lower Dir.
The state uses the term
Fitna al Khwarij
to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as
Fitna-al-Hindustan
to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Radio Pakistan
reported that PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir later visited Bannu and attended a high-level meeting on counter-terrorism. It added that they also participated in the funeral prayers of the South Waziristan operation martyrs.
“The prime minister reaffirmed that Pakistan’s response to terrorism will continue with full force and made it clear that no ambiguity or compromise will be tolerated. He said terrorist leaders and facilitators responsible for attacks in Pakistan are operating from Afghan soil with the backing of India.
“The prime minister stated that the Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the
khwarij
or stand with Pakistan. He highlighted the involvement of infiltrated Afghan nationals in terrorist incidents and stressed the urgent need for the repatriation of illegal Afghan residents currently living in Pakistan,” the report stated.
The prime minister further said that Pakistan rejected “politicisation and misleading narratives” on the issue of terrorism.
PM Shehbaz warned that “anyone facilitating or advocating” for terrorists or “acting as proxies for India” was essentially their agent and would be “dealt with accordingly”.
The report said the prime minister praised the “unity and resilience” of the nation, particularly the people of KP, for “standing like Banyanum Marsoos (a wall fortified with lead) with the state and armed forces against the Indian proxies”.
The premier affirmed that the government would immediately implement all necessary administrative and legal measures to ensure a more effective response to terrorism.
The report said PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir also visited the injured at Bannu Combined Military Hospital. They also received a detailed briefing on the regional security situation by the Peshawar Corps commander.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an
uptick
in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after
breaking a ceasefire
deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Earlier this month, six soldiers were martyred, while five terrorists were killed as security forces
thwarted an attack
on the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters in the Bannu district.
In response, the military has intensified its counter-terrorism operations.
From September 9 to 10
, security forces killed 14 “Indian-sponsored khwarij” in KP’s Mohmand district, four in North Waziristan, and one in Bannu district, according to the ISPR.
Yesterday, the ISPR said troops had also killed four “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in
Balochistan’s Mastung
.
Last month, security forces gunned down
50 terrorists
over a four-day operation, foiling an attempt by militants to cross over from Afghanistan into Balochistan.
KP operations
In an “encounter that took place in South Waziristan District, 13 more
khwarij
were neutralised by the security forces. However, during intense fire exchange, twelve brave sons of soil, having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced
shahadat
(martyrdom)”, the ISPR said.
The military’s media affairs wing further said that 22 “Indian-sponsored
khwarij
were sent to hell” in Bajaur after an intense fire exchange during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) conducted by the security forces.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian-sponsored killed
khwarij
, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” the statement added.
“Intelligence reports have unequivocally confirmed physical involvement of Afghan nationals in these heinous acts. Besides, [the] use of Afghan soil against Pakistan by
Fitna al Khawarij
terrorists continues to remain a grave point of concern,” the military further noted.
“Pakistan expects the interim Afghan government to uphold its responsibilities and deny use of its soil for terrorist activities against Pakistan,” it added.
Pakistan has
long maintained
that it faces a persistent threat from militant groups operating out of Afghanistan, including the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which was recently
designated
by the US State Department as a Foreign Terr­­orist Organisation.
The ISPR asserted: “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored
khwarji
found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve.”
PM Shehbaz earlier lauded the security forces for eliminating the 35 terrorists in the two operations and paid tribute to the 12 martyred soldiers who “fought with bravery”,
APP
reported, citing a press release from the PM Office.
The premier prayed for the martyrs’ high ranks and expressed his condolences to the bereaved families. He said that in the fight against terrorism, the security forces were “standing like a solid rock” and the entire nation paid tribute to them.
The prime minister also reiterated the government’s resolve to eradicate terrorism of all kinds from the country.
The ISPR later said that seven more soldiers were martyred in an operation in Lower Dir on Thursday when security Forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in the general area of Lal Qilla Maidan based on the reported presence of TTP terrorists.
“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the
khwarij
location, and after an intense fire exchange, 10 Indian sponsored
khwarij
were sent to hell.”
The ISPR said Naik Abdul Jalil, 39, resident of North Waziristan; Naik Gul Jan, 38, resident of Lakki Marwat; Lance Naik Azmat Ullah, 28, resident of Lakki Marwat; Sepoy Abdul Malik, 28, resident of Khyber; Sepoy Muhammad Amjad, 27, resident of Malakand; Sepoy Muhammad Dawood, 23, resident of Swabi and Sepoy Fazal Qayum, 21, resident of Dera Ismail Khan “fought gallantly” and were martyred while “saving precious lives of innocent civilians, who were made hostage by Indian sponsored
khawrij
”.
The ISPR further said: “Intelligence reports have unequivocally confirmed physical involvement of Afghan nationals in these heinous acts. Pakistan expects the Interim Afghan Government to uphold its responsibilities and deny its soil for terrorist activities against Pakistan.”

The protest sit-in on the KKH is being staged on the call of all traders’ bodies of Gilgit-Baltistan. Gulsher Khan, one of the protest sit-in organisers, said the federal and GB governments are not serious in resolving the issue.
He said protesters have been demanding their rights under the Constitution of Pakistan and laws. He said Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) could not collect federal taxes from GB people and its traders as the people of the region have no representation in Pakistan’s parliament and therefore the federal government could not collect taxes from the people of the region.
He said over 200 consignments imported from China have been stuck up at the Sost Dry Port for the last 10 months and because of this, traders of GB have been facing losses of billions of rupees.
Another organiser of the protest, Ebad Nagari, said that policies of FBR have made thousands of GB people jobless.

Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
A report issued by the PMD said that the earthquake originated at 8:17am PKT today, with its epicentre in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan at a depth of 195 kilometres, at a latitude of 36.51 degrees north and longitude of 70.98° east.

According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On 9-10 September, nineteen
Khwarij
belonging to the Indian proxy,
Fitna al Khwarij
were sent to hell in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.”
The state uses the term
Fitna al Khwarij
to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It later designated Balochistan-based groups as
Fitna-al-Hindustan
to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said that an intelligence-based operation was conducted in KP’s Mohmand district upon the reported presence of terrorists there.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s* location, and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen Indian-sponsored
khwarij
were sent to hell.”
It added that another intelligence-based operation was conducted in the general Datta Khel area of the North Waziristan district, where, during the ensuing fire exchange, four more terrorists were neutralised by the security forces.
In another encounter that took place in Bannu district, one more terrorist was killed, the statement added.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian-sponsored killed
Khwarij
, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” the statement said.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other
kharji
found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country.”
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the successful counter-terrorism operations.
According to
Radio Pakistan
,
President Zardari, in a statement, said the courage and professionalism of Pakistan’s brave soldiers continued to protect the nation from the scourge of terrorism.
“He emphasised that such operations demonstrate Pakistan’s unshakeable resolve to confront and defeat Indian-sponsored terrorism,” the report said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940660,End to trade diplomacy? - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"The era of naive globalisation is coming to an end with nations turning inward and prioritising their own interests. — Donald Tusk, Polish prime minister
WHILE one cannot say for sure what was in the minds of those who approved the new
National Tariff Policy 2025-2030
, they were definitely not looking at the prevalent global trade scene. The new policy seems to draw its inspiration from the ‘neoliberal orthodoxy’ fast becoming redundant in these challenging times, which columnist Gillian Tett describes as “a new era of ‘geo-economics’ where state-driven industrial policies — tariffs, export controls — are reshaping global trade.”
In the 1980s, leaders such as Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan supported the
free-market
ideas espoused by politicians such as Jack Kemp and economists such as Eugene Fama and Milton Friedman. They assumed that “markets and money were shaped by laws of supply and demand so consistent and universal that they could be modelled using tools from physics and math”. The myth did not survive even in the best of the times when global free trade policy in the World Trade Organisation was led initially by the US or later by China.
Even before the world saw the US-China trade war heat up, using tariffs and subsidies to influence flow of trade, globalisation and market access had been restricted through customs unions/ trade blocs such as Asean, the EU, EAEU, GCC and many others. The countries have been engaging with each other and these trade blocs, to gain market access through free or preferential trade agreements (FTAs/ PTAs). One of the main reasons for Pakistan facing difficulty in expanding its exports is that it has only few FTAs/ PTAs as compared to its competitors. That is to say, it has limited market access.
This is not the first time that we went down the path of old-fashioned romanticism with the ideas of free trade and tariff liberalisation. The rationale was always the same: global integration, competitiveness and efficiency. The outcomes, however, tell a different story.
The new tariff policy poses a risk to external sector stability and the current account surplus.
We should have kept in mind the lessons from the liberalisation era of the 1990s under the
IMF
and
World Bank
structural adjustment programmes. It was said that tariff rationalisation would modernise trade and integrate the economy into the global market. Between 1996 and 2005, Pakistan’s average tariff was steeply brought down from 46.6 per cent to just 14.3pc. Instead of expanding exports, Pakistan entered into an unending spiral of high trade deficits eating away workers’ remittances and leaving behind large current account deficits. The trade deficit which was just $3.1 billion in 1995-96 grew four times to $12.1bn in 2005-06 and 16 times to $48.3bn in 2021-22.
In three decades (1995-2025),
Pakistan’s exports
increased only 3.7 times from $8.7bn to $32bn. In these 30 years, the export of regional peers, ie, Bangladesh and India, grew by 12.6 and 14.3 times, respectively. In contrast, our imports jumped almost eight times, from $11.8bn in 1995-96 to $80.3bn, its highest in 2021-22.
The unilateral opening of our markets to foreign goods, without an accompanying industrial policy which would have allowed our industry to grow from producers of low-value goods to high-value ones, left our industries facing their worst downward spiral into an era of premature de-industrialisation. In these three decades, Pakistan’s industrial sector recorded only a six-fold increase, compared with 30-fold in Vietnam, 17-fold in Bangladesh, and nine-fold in India.
The National Tariff Policy 2025-30 seeks to reduce the average tariff from 10.4pc to below 6pc by 2030, far below the average tariff of around 16pc in India and 14pc in Bangladesh. The new structure reduces five slabs to four (0pc, 5pc, 10pc, 15pc), reducing from the current highest slab of 20pc. Bangladesh and India continue to retain their maximum slabs of 25pc and 70pc respectively, despite enjoying a much larger market access. Both our competitors continue to impose additional duties and surcharges, whereas Pakistan has committed to phase these out in four to five years under the new policy.
The previous
National Tariff Policy 2019-24
distinguished between inputs essential for industrial development and luxury consumption goods, lowering duties on raw material, intermediate inputs and machinery while retaining higher tariffs on finished and non-essential imports. It helped reduce production costs without exposing domestic firms to undue competition. If accompanied by the right policy mix, it could have provided the foundation for sustainable industrial growth.
Any attempt to trade liberalisation must be accompanied by a reasonably sound industrial base and enabling global environment. The new tariff policy puts the hard-earned stability in the external sector and the current account surplus achieved only last year, at immense risk. The knee-jerk tariff policy shift has shown the future trend in the first two months of its partial implementation. The trade deficit in the months of July and August jumped 29pc at $6bn, up from $4.6bn last year for the corresponding period against a 12.5pc decline in exports in the month of August.
As a market of 250 million consumers, Pakistan can attract many investors and traders if it can offer a profitable proposition through preferential tariff concessions to economies which make reciprocal concessions to our exporters and investors. If we open our market unilaterally for the entire world, giving away tariffs as a bargaining chip, why would anyone bother to discuss FTAs/ PTAs with us and open their markets for our exports?
“The world has changed, globalisation is over and we are now in a new era,” said Keir Starmer, the British prime minister. We no longer live in the Reagan-Thatcher era of
neoliberalism
or
globalisation
. Let us put aside outdated editions of a redundant policy mix. Let us wake up to the new real world of smart trade deals, using tariff policy as a tool for negotiations and for exchanging market access, instead of allowing unilateral access. It must be accompanied by a reliable security environment, enabling policies and their continuity; and efficient protection for those industrial sectors that are critical for our economic security.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945136/truth-or-noise,Truth or noise? - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"ON Sept 28, citizens and journalists across the globe mark World News Day, an occasion to remind ourselves why reliable journalism matters.
In a world awash with propaganda, distortion, and algorithm-driven distraction, this year’s theme — ‘Choose Truth. Choose Facts. Choose Journalism’ — is both urgent and universal, resonating across societies facing polarisation and rising distrust.
Journalism is as essential to society as electricity or clean water. Without it, civic debate shrinks, corruption festers, and democracies lose their footing. Across the world, the signs of decline are plain. Reporters are being silenced, attacked, and even killed in record numbers. In some conflict zones they are no longer collateral casualties but deliberate targets.
Governments increasingly muzzle the press or impose internet shutdowns during crises, depriving citizens of their right to know. Economic pressures have hollowed out many newsrooms, while AI systems recycle original reporting without credit or compensation, often spitting out half-truths and fabricated quotes. Studies show that AI-generated news responses are often riddled with errors, creating confusion and mistrust. Left unchecked, these trends threaten to replace truth with noise and accountability with impunity.
And yet, there are reasons not to despair. In parts of the world, trust in news has held steady or even risen, defying the narrative of universal decline. Surveys in Europe, Africa and Asia show that where journalism remains visible, local and accountable, audiences respond. Newsrooms experimenting with hyperlocal coverage, deeper community engagement and data-driven storytelling demonstrate that serious reporting still commands attention.
The future will not be decided by technology alone but by whether societies are willing to support the journalism that holds power to account.
Pakistan too could rediscover this value. But here, the habits of serious reading have withered, with younger generations relying on fragmented online feeds. That narrowing of civic literacy carries obvious risks for democracy.
To push back, the All Pakistan Newspapers Society mounted its annual National Newspaper Readership Day campaign. Slogans such as ‘Read today, lead tomorrow’ and ‘Influencers don’t make history. Truth builds nations’ seek to remind families that newspapers are not relics but vital repositories of record and context.
The campaign is right to stress that informed citizens cannot be built on shallow trends or algorithmic distraction. But messages alone will not suffice. Pakistan’s media must commit to credibility and diversity, while schools and universities should integrate serious reading into civic education. Above all, the state must stop treating independent journalism as a nuisance and recognise it as a safeguard of democracy.
World News Day is more than a commemoration. It is a reminder that while journalism is imperfect, it remains irreplaceable. Societies that choose journalism choose democracy. Those that do not, risk being governed not by facts, but by noise.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944447/apex-court-affirms-sjcs-sole-authority-over-judges-conduct,Apex court affirms SJC’s sole authority over judges’ conduct - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"• Allowing judges to target peers would lead to ‘internal conflicts’, Justice Mandokhail warns
• Ruling underscores principle of judicial equality, places emphasis on judicial discipline; affirms that judges cannot ‘pick and choose’ cases
• IHC judges’ pleas ‘still under review’, says SC spox
ISLAMABAD: Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail of the Supreme Court, in an 11-page verdict, has ruled that judges cannot initiate contempt proceedings against their peers, establishing that only the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has the constitutional authority to probe misconduct allegations against the judges of both the apex and high courts.
He explained that judges within the superior cou­rts share equal power and status, with no individual holding superiority or inferiority over another. He warned that allowing judges to take such punitive mea­sures against one another would cripple the judiciary.
The ruling formally justified why a six-judge Supreme Court bench on Jan 27 disposed of an Intra-Court Appeal (ICA) filed by Additional Registrar (Judicial) Nazar Abbas. Mr Abbas had faced contempt proceedings from a smaller two-judge bench for his non-compliance with a judicial order.
The additional registrar was subsequently removed from his office for withdrawing a case challenging the Customs Act from that two-judge bench, which was headed by a senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, and transferring it to a larger Constitutional Bench.
Justice Mandokhail warned that permitting judges to hold their colleagues in contempt could ignite internal conflicts, ultimately threatening the integrity of the entire justice system.
“Permitting superior court judges to initiate contempt proceedings against his fellow judges would militate against the necessity of maintaining a high degree of comity amongst them,” Justice Mandokhail wrote.
He cautioned that such a practice would foster an environment of hostility rather than collegiality, severely damaging the institution’s credibility.
“The maintenance of cordial relations amongst members of the superior judiciary is important for the smooth functioning of courts and issuing a process of contempt of court by a judge against his fellow judge would create internal conflicts, grievances and grudges amongst themselves,” the judgement said.
The justice painted a dire picture of the potential consequences.
“There would be anarchy and justice system would crumble, which will be against the principle of ‘Esprit de corps’ (common spirit existing in the members of a group and inspiring enthusiasm, devotion, and strong regard for the honour of the group),” Justice Mandokhail observed.
He added that “the trend will erode public trust and that no legal system can permit judicial system to collapse.”
The judgement affirmed that while judges possess inherent constitutional power to initiate contempt of court proceedings, this authority does not extend to their colleagues on the bench.
“Judges of the superior courts possess the same status and power within their hierarchy, therefore, no one amongst them neither was superior or inferior to issue direction nor can punish the other,” he noted.
The ruling clarified the boundaries of judicial immunity, observing that while judges are generally protected for their judicial work and administrative functions, this protection is not absolute and does not shield them from accountability for misconduct. However, the proper and sole channel for such accountability is the Supreme Judicial Council.
“The allegation of misconduct against a judge of the Supreme Court or of a high court can only be inquired into and dealt with under Article 209 of the Constitution by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC),” Justice Mandokhail observed.
Recalling a rare historical instance, the justice referenced the case of Iftikhar Chaudhry and others, in which the Supreme Court had issued contempt notices to several apex and high court judges for violating a restraining order from Nov 3, 2007. However, Justice Mandokhail stressed that the context of that case was unique and markedly different from the matter at hand.
The judgement also delved into crucial matters of judicial procedure and discipline, particularly the handling of “part-heard” cases.
Justice Mandokhail affirmed the well-settled legal principle that matters partially heard by a bench should not be transferred administratively unless explicitly permitted by law or constitutional rules.
“The purpose behind this principle was that once a bench or a court hears a case at a considerable length, transferring that case from that court can lead to a denovo hearing,” he explained.
However, he introduced a critical exception that directly applied to the registrar’s case: if a court’s jurisdiction is removed through new legislation or a constitutional amendment while a matter is pending, that court loses all authority to proceed.   “The court where the matter is pending or is treated as part-heard, it loses its authority to take any further action into the matter, hence, must stop proceedings,” Justice Mandokhail observed.
“With great respect, there was no justification for the regular bench for further proceedings into the matter in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Constitution after the amendment,” he emphasised.   He noted that court committees also had no power to override the constitutional change.
Underscoring that judges are bound by their oath and a strict Code of Conduct, he said, “If every judge of the SC or of a High Court starts picking and choosing cases for disposal by him, without following the practice and procedure in vogue, of their respective courts, the discipline in the court will be damaged.”
IHC judges’ petition under review
Separately, the Supreme Court said that petitions
filed
by five senior sitting judges from the Islamabad High Court are in the normal process of review and that any order regarding their fate will be made in due course.
“Petitions are in the normal process of procedural scrutiny and any order thereon is to be made in due course,” said Dr. Shahid Hussain Kamboyo, a spokesperson for the Supreme Court.
On Sept 19, five judges — Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Raffat Imtiaz — personally appeared before the apex court to file their constitutional petitions.
The petitioner judges pleaded with the Supreme Court to declare that the administrative powers of the Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court cannot be deployed to undermine or trump the judicial powers of high court judges.  They sought a declaration that the CJ-IHC was not authorised to constitute benches or transfer cases once a high court bench was already seized of a matter.
It also asked the apex court to declare that the CJ-IHC cannot exclude available judges from the roster at will and use the power to issue a roster to oust judges from performing judicial functions.

against
the cancellation of Islamabad High Court’s Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s law degree over non-prosecution, observing that
shouting slogans
against the judiciary and disrupting the court’s decorum was “highly unbecoming”.
In a related development, the University of Karachi (KU) issued a fresh declaration about the withdrawal and cancellation of the IHC judge’s degree.
On Thursday, heated scenes were witnessed at the SHC as a two-judge bench declined to entertain the plea of the IHC judge to become a party in proceedings on seven petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.
The two-judge constitutional bench (CB) comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, however, set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions before it.
In its written order on Friday, the CB noted that it had “given an opportunity of hearing to all the lawyers for the petitioners on the question of maintainability” of these pleas, but they “deliberately chose not to avail this opportunity and instead walked out of [the] courtroom while causing a rumpus”.
It added that it was for the court to regulate its own proceedings and it could not be held hostage to the “whims or wishes of the advocates as to the manner in which the petitions shall be heard”.
The order read that Justice Jahangiri, with the permission of the bench, addressed the court with dignity and patience, but “not on the point of any petition or listed application, which, if any, were accordingly dismissed for non-prosecution as he also left [the] courtroom despite being given an opportunity of being heard”.
On the objections raised by the counsel for the petitioners, the CB noted that if they had any reservations about the transfer of these pleas from one bench to another, the appropriate course was to approach the apex court, which they failed to do.
The order further read that it was up to a judge to decide if they wanted to recuse themselves from a case or not based on their conscience.
The petitions had been
filed
last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the University of Karachi (KU) syndicate, challenging the decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU decisions, restraining the university from taking coercive measures.
However, the dismissal of these petitions over non-prosecution has led to the withdrawal of the earlier interim stay and restraining order.
The SHC, in its order, observed that the superior courts possessed the “inherent power to dismiss constitutional petitions for non-prosecution or default regulate proceedings under Articles 199 of the Constitution, a principle confirmed by the Supreme Court in PLD 1993 SC 341 and 2006 SCMR 1154, where a persistent lack of diligence justifies dismissal”.
“Therefore, this court is compelled to dismiss the petitions due to non-prosecution,” it added.
It noted that when the counsel representing the parties, along with other members of the bar, insisted that their objections be decided first, the court informed them that all matters would be heard and decided together.
The bench further noted that they began shouting slogans against the judiciary. completely disrupting the decorum of the court.
“Such conduct is highly unbecoming and not expected from senior members of the legal profession,” it added.
“Prima facie, such conduct amounts to contempt of court. However, by way of indulgence and by showing maximum judicial restraint, we have decided to refrain ourselves from issuing any such notices. It is expected that the concerned counsel should maintain court decorum in future.”
The CB directed the SHC registrar to immediately preserve all CCTV recordings and any audio recording of September 25, both inside and outside of the courtroom.
KU declaration
After the dismissal of the petitions, the KU issued a new declaration about the withdrawal and cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s degree. In August last year, the KU syndicate had cancelled the judge’s law degree on the recommendation of its UMC.
The decision came a few hours after the alleged detention of academic and syndicate member Dr Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by the police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was
released
in the evening only after the syndicate had decided to cancel the degree.
In a statement issued on Thursday, KU said the syndicate, in its meeting held on August 31, 2024, had cancelled the LLB degree of IHC judge as well as his enrollment after finding him guilty of unfair means.
“In compliance with the syndicate meeting held on [August 21,2024] vide resolution No.06, the LLB results and degree of Mr Tariq Mehmood s/o Qazi Muhammad Akram being seat No. 22857 and enrollment No. AIL -7124/87 is hereby withdrawn and cancelled,” it added.

• Fund questions use of emergency funds, delays in governance reforms
• $1bn tranche hinges on progress in review talks
ISLAMABAD: An Inter­national Mone­tary Fund (IMF) review mission began its work simultaneously in Karachi and Islamabad on Thursday, holding discussions with authorities on mixed programme performance without the customary opening engagement with Minister for Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb, who is currently on a visit to the United States.
Sources said the introductory meeting with Mr Aurangzeb, initially scheduled for Sept 25, has now been moved to Monday (Sept 29) in his absence. In the meantime, two IMF teams — one dealing with monetary policy and the other with fiscal policy — are engaged with the State Bank of Pakistan and federal government entities.
The mission is expected to stay for about two weeks and will also hold forward-looking discussions, pressing the authorities to expedite implementation of end-December 2025 targets.
According to the sources, the government has already used one-third of the Rs390 billion budgetary allocation for natural disasters and emergencies, clearing Rs130bn in past dues owed to commercial banks for incentives and fees linked to remittances sent through formal channels.
The government will now have to justify these payments from the emergency fund at a time when it is also seeking relaxations from the IMF on account of
flood damages
. Moreover, no allocation has been made in the current budget for such incentives, though an estimated Rs100bn would be required.
The IMF mission also expects clarity on the scale of recent flood damages during its stay, but the government has yet to finalise estimates. Authorities are hoping the Fund will allow relaxations in primary budget surplus and fiscal deficit targets to create space for flood-related expenditure without resorting to new taxes or cuts in development spending.
The government has missed several key end-June 2025 targets, including FBR’s revenue collection, retail taxation and provincial cash surpluses, and could face difficulties on these counts.
At the same time, the governance and corruption diagnostic report — pending with the authorities for review and publication — has still not been released, leaving the associated governance action plan in limbo. Progress on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) governance reforms has also stalled, despite commitments made with the IMF.
Although provincial legislatures successfully enacted agriculture income tax laws in time, their actual implementation and collection from September-October remains uncertain, especially given the flood situation in Punjab and Sindh. This uncertainty also clouds the government’s ability to assess and deliver the required support for flood-affected people, sectors and facilities.
On the positive side, Pakistan has almost met all quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2025, but it continues to lag behind on indicative targets and structural benchmarks. These gaps could affect the pace of implementation in the months ahead.
Since the $7bn Extended Fund Facility and $1.4bn climate-linked Resilience & Sustainability Facility are reviewed twice a year, both sides will have to reach an agreement on past performance as well as future commitments.
If the review is successfully concluded, Pakistan will qualify for disbursement of about $1bn (equivalent to 760 million IMF special drawing rights) by the end of next month.

They said that tribal elders must be involved in restoring peace in the province. “Now, as the situation has reached this point, jirgas should be held to resolve the issue instead of carrying out any military operation,” the declaration read.
It read that the KP Assembly recently
passed
a unanimous resolution against the
KP Action (in Aid of civil power) Ordinance
and had declared it against basic human rights.
They said that the Peshawar High Court had also declared the Ordinance against basic human rights but the provincial government had filed a plea against the Peshawar High Court’s verdict in the Supreme Court and urged the provincial government to withdraw its appeal from the apex court.
The jirga members said that Afghanistan was a brotherly country, so all those concerned held talks with the interim Afghan government by involving tribal elders.
It demanded that all those concerned immediately reopen all the trade routes including Gorsal, Ghulam Khan, Nawapas and Srarogha border crossings with Afghanistan in order to boost economic activities in the province.
The declaration read that taking over the province’s resources would never be allowed.
The jirga members said that an agreement was signed between Frontier Works Organisation and the American company and demanded that progress on the agreement should be stopped immediately, which was done in violation of the 18th Constitutional Amendment.
The jirga members also demanded that before merger, the merged districts were promised three per cent in the National Finance Commission. It demanded that the promises should be fulfilled besides the arrears of the promised Rs100 billion annual funds for the merged districts, should also be paid.
The jirga members said that many people were martyred in drone attacks and mortar shell explosions. They demanded that their cases be registered, adding that those, who had left their homes due to military operations, should be repatriated and all their losses compensated.
The jirga called for an end to unannounced curfews in several parts of the tribal districts.

Deaths from falling into open gutters and manholes
frequently occur
in Pakistan, particularly in major cities like Karachi, where poorly managed drainage systems, missing or broken covers, and inadequate lighting in congested neighbourhoods often put pedestrians in
danger
. The gutters are filled with
toxic sewage
and lack oxygen, making it easy to suffocate or drown within minutes.
“Four people fell into a drain near Siddique Wahab Road while cleaning it, three of whom lost their lives, while another remains unconscious,” the Edhi statement said.
The deceased have been identified as 22-year-old Vishal, 19-year-old Shahir, and 42-year-old George. The fourth man — identified as 26-year-old Faisal — was rushed to the Civil Hospital’s Trauma Centre, while the bodies of the deceased have been shifted to an Edhi morgue.
Police surgeon Sumaiya Syed told
Dawn.com
that the workers “expired in a manhole while cleaning it,” adding that the families have refused a post-mortem.
As per DIG South Syed Asad Raza, “the workers were hired by Union Council chairman Javed, and were working on the drain since 1am.” He added that, “when one of the workers lost consciousness while cleaning, two workers entered the manhole to pull him out..but both fell unconscious later.”
The workers were hired for a wage of Rs15,000, according to DIG South.
On Friday, three private sanitation workers were
asphyxiated

homes
, locals and officials told
Dawn
on Thursday.
They said the residents of five areas, mostly in Lowi Mamund, were returning after the district administration issued a notification on Tuesday allowing them to do so from Wednesday.
The people of five areas of Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils, including Lar Kalan, Bar Kalan, Ganam Shah, Chamyaar Johar and Chohtra, were displaced due to a
security operation
against terrorists.
They’re now allowed to go back to their homes following the removal of terrorists, according to a notification posted on the official Facebook page of deputy commissioner Shahid Ali Khan on Tuesday night.
However, the residents and officials of the district administration didn’t specify the number of people returned. The homecoming process got under way on Thursday.
Return allowed after removal of terrorists
They, however, told
Dawn
that scores of families of those areas had safely returned to their homes after remaining displaced for over a month in line with the district administration’s orders issued for their safety during the anti-terrorist operation.
Residents said both Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils had recorded the safe return of people in large numbers along with their belongings on Thursday around a month after their evacuation.
They told
Dawn
that most residents, who were extremely excited to return, expressed immense gratitude on entering their homes. Some, mostly the elderly, even offered prayers of thanksgiving on seeing their homes safe after a month.
A number of displaced people who returned to their houses in those areas told

“We are deeply grateful to the Almighty Allah for allowing us to return to our homes after spending over a month in relief camps and relatives’ homes outside our areas, which had been our most challenging time since the last operation was carried out against terrorists in the region in 2008,” a returnee said.
He and other residents praised authorities for clearing their areas of terrorists and enabling them to return home at the earliest, saying they hadn’t expected to be able to go back home so soon.
They said all people from the areas recently declared free of terrorists were eager to return, and for it, authorities had to arrange transportation to ensure their safe and early arrival.

Al Jazeera
when asked about the possible position Islamabad would take in case a united body in the Middle East was formed to stop Israeli aggression.
The interview, recorded ahead of an Arab-Islamic summit on Israel’s recent strikes in Qatar and published late on Monday night, saw Dar in conversation with
Al Jazeera
’s Osama Bin Javed. who asked the foreign minister if the formation of a united body in the Middle East, away from the United Nations structure, to intervene in Gaza was an option on the table.
To that, Dar began his response by mentioning that “vis a vis UN Security Council, a mechanism could be chalked out”.
“For example, they have [imposed] very serious sanctions on countries that don’t listen to them. And that is a very severe economic dent or pain they can cause to any country.”
He then went on to say that there had been talk along the lines of “some sort of combined security force” during recent interactions among Arab nations and the Arab League.
Dar added, “Why not? What’s wrong with that? They should [have a combined force]. And according to their own capacity, own strength, they should create some mechanism. Not for aggression purpose [
sic
], but for peaceful purpose[s], for stopping the aggressor, for stopping the occupier, for stopping someone who just doesn’t listen.”
Where would a “nuclear-powered Pakistan” stand with that, asked Javed.
“Nuclear-powered Pakistan, obviously, as a member of the ummah, would discharge its duty,” replied Dar.
Javed then asked him to further elaborate in his answer.
In his response, Dar clarified that Pakistan saw nuclear weapons only for deterrence and didn’t intend to use them. “We have no intention of using it; it is only a deterrence.”
He continued: “But Pakistan has a very large, known, very effective army, very effective air force, very effective navy … We have proved that we can beat [our opponent] even conventionally, if challenged.”
The interviewer then brought up a recent
debate at the UN Security Council
where Israel had invoked a 2011 attack within Pakistan to kill Osama Bin Laden in a bid to justify its attacks in Gaza.
“So if now Pakistan comes under attack, from a country like the United States, for instance, would Pakistan act differently [than it did in 2011]?” he asked.
“We would not allow the breach of our territorial integrity, no matter by whom, be it the smallest or the largest country. We would respond. But I don’t see any reason why the US or any other country would do it. India did it. You saw what happened to them,” replied Dar.
Javed then pointed to the lack of action by the US in stopping Israel from attacking Qatar and asked Dar whether Pakistan still saw America as a “trustworthy” security partner.
In his response, Dar highlighted the “positive” role the US had played in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan following a recent escalation between the two countries in May.
Earlier in the interview, recent
strikes by Israel
in Qatar that targeted Hamas leaders in Doha also came up.
Sharing his views on the subject, Dar said Israel’s reasons to attack a sovereign country were “totally baseless”. He pointed out that Qatar was mediating talks, along with the US and Egypt, for peace in Gaza when that attack happened, terming Israel’s actions “rogue”.
Dar highlighted that Israel had attacked multiple countries in the Middle East and said that international laws, international humanitarian rules and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and UN Security Council resolutions seemed to have “no effect on one country, which is repeatedly doing what it feels like”.
“That means [the] multilateral system needs very serious reforms right now … This is the need of the hour. I think the UN Security Council, as well as the UN system itself needs very serious reforms.
“The UN Security Council is meant to maintain peace in the world. And if its resolutions are just put in the bin, as it is happening since so many years — [by] Israel in Gaza and Palestine and by India in Kashmir — what do we expect from the multilateral system?”
Asked whether all Muslim countries in the world were carrying equal weight and “doing the jobs they should be doing”, Dar said Pakistan believed that no matter how big or small a state was, their “dignity and respect should be equal”.
In this connection, he also gave the example of India, mentioning that “some country had claimed to have hegemony, to be the net security provider, to be the captain of the entire region”.
But “you saw what happened between May 7 and 10. It’s all settled. The hegemony is buried,” he added, referring to a
four-day armed escalation
between India and Pakistan. Dar further said that military action by Pakistan at the time was in self-defence.
Answering a follow-up question, he said he believed with regard to Gaza, diplomacy and dialogue were the best options. “It takes time, but you can reach a solution when you sit at the table. But if you are not willing to sit [at] the table, if you are not sincere and have negative and evil designs of expansionism […] then you will never be sincere about the dialogue. So, sincerity in dialogue is also required.”
To a question about whether Israel could attack Pakistan next after Qatar, Dar reminded that India had tried that and Israel “gave it full support according to our information” and the “world saw that the claim is exposed”.
“We are ready. Again, I repeat, we want peace. The nuclear-armed state does not want any destabilisation in the region because that will have consequences beyond [the region],” he added, stressing the need for collective efforts for reforms in UN Security Council resolutions.
Saying that Israel and India were the only countries that did not abide by UN Security Council resolutions, he emphasised evolving a mechanism in the council for taking practical measures to “control the situation” if its resolutions were not acted upon and implemented.
“And that might require physical actions, physical interventions.”",2025-09-16,Dawn.com,1545,0.000176

He was addressing a judicial conference at the apex court,
marking the commencement
of the new judicial year.
“We all talk about technology, we all talk about AI to be utilised for enhancing the justice delivery system,” Justice Afridi said, adding that 61,000 files will be digitally screened under a project that will be completed within six months.
“It is only when you have them digitally scanned that you can utilise the tools of AI for categorisation. It will be easy to categorise cases and to fix before one bench one issue,” he said.
The chief justice emphasised, “Yes, technology is necessary. Yes, AI has to be utilised. But no, not now. We are not ready for it. We have to prepare ourselves for that.”
Justices Mansoor Ali Shah, Munib Akhtar, Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Athar Minallah, Shahid Waheed, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Malik Shahzad Ahmad were among the fellow SC judges seen attending the event. Judges of the high courts were also present.

Judges’ leave
During his speech, CJP Afridi also detailed a number of new policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs) introduced to address the structure of discussions on important issues.
Justice Afridi remarked that the chief justice could previously take up any case out of order for an early hearing, but SOPs were now in place to prevent that.
Stating that the court was taking up cases on a “first-come, first-served” basis, the top judge clarified that the court would not hear cases out of their order.
Then, apparently responding to one of the questions raised in Justice Shah’s
recent letter
on the CJP having powers to grant or refuse judges’ leaves, Justice Afridi said leaves outside of judicial holidays required permission.
“Let’s look at the grant of leave. I made it very clear, during holidays anyone who wants to go anywhere, no issue. But when there is court work, then I said here is the discretion, discretion is the exercise, it is the criteria, you have got everything in writing.”
Just last month, the SC issued a number of policy decisions taken between Oct 26, 2024 and Aug 12, 2025. One such decision, reflected in a General Standing Order dated July 29, 2025, amended the Supreme Court Judges (Leave, Pension and Privileges) Order 1997,
empowering the CJP
to grant or refuse leave, whether within or outside Pakistan, or to revoke or curtail leave already granted to judges of the court.
In his letter, Justice Shah wrote: “In principle, leave can, if at all, only possibly be considered for refusal where: (i) a part-heard case cannot be adjourned; (ii) urgent administrative duty demands presence; or (iii) a judge is negligent in work and seeks leave to evade it.
“Yet, in practice, leave is being denied even when none of these circumstances exist-apparently to enforce compliance and control, and to prevent independent judges from speaking at international forums.”
Enforced disappearances’ issue given ‘serious attention’
CJP Afridi further observed that the
National Judicial Policy-Making Committee
, which he heads and includes all the chief justices, had given “serious attention” to the issue of enforced disappearances.
“We sat down and decided on 17 items on which we are to proceed […]
First and foremost was that serious attention was given to enforced disappearances,” the top judge said.
He thanked Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan for
assuring the judiciary
that the government was “seriously considering a mechanism to ensure the production of detained persons”.
“I thank you for that and I expect that soon, we will have a good news regarding that,” Justice Afridi remarked.
“Number two, to safeguard the dignity of judges, SOPs have also been framed by the high courts to protect the judicial officers from external influence. This is the district judiciary. We have done it; all the district judiciary, all the high courts have framed their rules,” the CJP stated.
SC reforms based on 5 principles
Justice Afridi observed that after
assuming the CJP’s office
in October 2024, he felt the need for reforms, which were categorised based on “five principles”.
The CJP listed those principles: “To improve service delivery through technology, to improve access and transparency, to strengthen legal and regulatory framework, leverage international and external resources, and to revitalise the attached departments.”
Noting that the apex court had eight sections, CJP Afridi said each section prioritised speedy justice. He said digital case-filing and case-tracking were among the measures raised during six interactive meetings held to discuss the SC’s reforms.
“There are two groups in the lawyers’ community,” the CJP remarked, adding that members from both were included in the consultation process for judicial reforms.
He detailed that a high-powered committee led by Justice Shahid Waheed, which also included Justices Irfan Saadat Khan, Afghan and Abbasi, reviewed suggestions made by the SC “sections”, some judges and lawyers. Those were then placed before an administrative full court meeting on April 17.
Justice Afridi also spoke of the “Public Facilitation Centre” inaugurated today, which will begin its operations on October 1 and will provide “all details” related to cases.
Reiterating the need for speedy disposal of cases, he asserted: “We have always worked for the supremacy of the law.”
Emphasising that rules cannot be made within a single day, the judge urged those having objections to file their recommendations, which would then be taken up by a committee and eventually the full court. “I assure you that whatever your proposals are will be […] taken into consideration,” he affirmed.
‘Reduced security protocols for judges’
During his address, CJP Afridi highlighted that the security provided to him and other judges has been reduced, as well as the protocols when in Islamabad’s Red Zone, which houses key government buildings.
“I had nine security contingents as the chief justice. I sat down with the security people and I said ‘I am in the Red Zone, my residence is in the Red Zone, please have a heart’. So we have come down to this that there will only be two security vehicles with me, and same is the case with the worthy judges.”
He remarked that judges could need security when going outside of Islamabad, but not as much when in the Red Zone.
Continuing his speech, Justice Afridi noted that the
Supreme Judicial Council
(SJC) had decided on 64 complaints against judges, 72 had been referred to the council’s members, and 65 were pending, which would be considered in the SJC meeting later this month.
AGP Awan, Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Tahir Nasrullah Warraich, and Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President Mian Rauf Atta also addressed the event.
Separately, CJP Afridi also inaugurated a “Media Station” at the SC, telling mediapersons on the occasion: “You people are necessary for the system because you keep everyone in check. […] Please keep us on check but it should be healthy.”",2025-09-08,Dawn.com,1866,0.0002
https://www.dawn.com/news/1942543/balochistan-launches-first-financial-digital-e-filing-system,Balochistan launches first financial digital e-filing system - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"QUETTA: The Balochistan government has introduced the first-ever automated financial digital e-filing system in the province to promote transparency and digital governance.
Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti launched the digital financial e-filing system at a ceremony held at the Chief Minister Secretariat on Tuesday. Provincial ministers, assembly members and senior officials from various administrative departments attended the event.
The initiative marks a significant step towards modernising public sector operations and providing citizens with direct access to financial and development data.
Speaking at the inauguration, the chief minister said the new system would streamline financial processes, eliminate bureaucratic inefficiencies, and strengthen public oversight.
Citizens will be able to monitor projects and financial records through digital access
“The e-filing system is designed to serve as the backbone of comprehensive financial reform across the province,” Mr Bugti said, adding that its core features include online budget submissions, with all government departments now required to submit budget requests digitally.
He said the system would assist at every stage of approval, with all financial transactions recorded and accessible. The aim, he said, is to replace outdated and opaque procedures that have long undermined efficiency.
Officials will have access to live data, enabling faster and better-informed decisions. At the same time, citizens will be able to monitor development projects and financial records on their devices, checking whether initiatives are completed or merely proposed.
“Balochistan is now stepping into the digital age, aligning itself with global standards of transparency and accountability,” the chief minister said.
To ensure swift implementation, he directed all departmental secretaries to immediately adopt the system. He also announced that future cabinet meetings would be conducted on digital tablets to avoid delays and phase out paper-based processes.
CM Bugti praised the local officials and IT experts who developed the system, noting that it was built entirely by Balochistan’s youth and professionals without external assistance. He also announced a one-month salary bonus for government employees involved in the project and pledged similar incentives for private-sector contributors as a token of appreciation.
Earlier, Finance Secretary Imran Zarkoon gave a detailed briefing and live demonstration of the system’s features. The ceremony concluded with the chief minister distributing certificates of appreciation to the development team, reaffirming the government’s commitment to the responsible and transparent use of public resources.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942333/kabuls-choice,Kabul’s choice - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"IT is apparently a very simple proposition. The Afghan Taliban can either
cooperate
with Pakistan and eliminate
safe havens
for the banned TTP and other terrorist outfits on their soil. Or they can continue to
nurture
an array of violent outfits and sour Afghanistan’s chances of regional integration and greater diplomatic recognition, along with torpedoing any chances of better ties with Pakistan.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif made the
offer
to Kabul’s rulers while visiting Bannu on Saturday, asking the Afghan Taliban to “choose between Pakistan and TTP”. The PM’s comments reflect the
frustration
of the administration towards the Taliban. The current dispensation has tried both carrots and sticks with Kabul to help stop terrorist attacks from Afghanistan-based militants, but neither approach has delivered results.
The frustration is understandable because terrorist attacks have resulted in high
troop losses
for Pakistan. Just last week, at least 19 troops were martyred during operations against terrorists in KP. The military also says that Afghan nationals have been
involved
in attacks on Pakistan. To its credit, Pakistan has tried to mend fences
diplomatically
with the Afghan Taliban, and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has undertaken several
visits
to Kabul.
Additionally, a
trilateral mechanism
involving Pakistan, China and Afghanistan has been launched to try and ‘mainstream’ the Taliban, offering them incentives for cutting ties with terrorist groups. On the other hand, Pakistan has also undertaken kinetic action inside Afghanistan to target militant sanctuaries. However, so far, neither method has been successful in convincing the Taliban to change their ways.
It is true that the TTP and the Afghan Taliban are linked by ideology. But if the Taliban seek greater engagement with the outside world, they must decide whether to stay wedded to their ideology, or assure their neighbours that they will not allow terrorist groups to threaten regional security. The Taliban may be reluctant to act against militant groups; however, they must guarantee that these violent actors will not pose a threat to neighbouring states.
The Taliban’s denial that they are hosting militants does not fly, as a special UN monitoring body has
confirmed
on several occasions that various militant groups, including the TTP, are active in Afghanistan.
For Pakistan, the dilemma is acute. The status quo is obviously not an option, as anti-Pakistan terrorist groups find sanctuary and support in Afghanistan. However, cutting ties with the Taliban is not a viable option either, as it may drive the Afghan rulers into a more extreme direction. The least bad option at present seems to be limited engagement with Kabul, with pressure from regional states, especially China, on the Taliban to do more against the militants. Moreover, Pakistan must also improve its counterterrorism methods to stop the infiltration of terrorists, and prevent troop and civilian losses.

palla
fish, a unique species,” he added.
On better days, his catch comprises around five to six small fish, each of which sells for Rs200. Of late, Ali and many other fishermen like him spend long hours inside the river, which has swelled courtesy the improved flows downstream of Kotri.

A lifeline
For people of Sindh, the Indus river holds a special place in their hearts. It is celebrated. It is their lifeline. And this is exactly why, until April this year, a
massive anti-canal movement
, led by lawyers and political forces, converged in the province. It ended only with the
announcement
by the prime minister-led Council of Common Interests (CCI) that no new canals would be built over the river until a mutual understanding could be reached among the provinces.
“Floods in Sindh are taken as a positive sign because the province is located at the tail end of the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS)”, explained Sindh Chamber of Agriculture (SCA) vice president Nabi Bux Sathio, a progressive farmer.
“I think the Indus river flows aplenty these days. This is certainly going to benefit the entire area wherefrom the water flows will travel between the three barrages,” he said.

According to Sathio, groundwater in Sindh is generally brackish compared to upper riparian Punjab. “So, these flows will recharge the groundwater to some extent. Likewise, lands in four districts — Tando Mohammad Khan, Sujawal, Thatta and Badin — have lost soil fertility wherever they were located close to the drainage system,” he continued, adding that the flows within the two dykes of the Indus river will help reclaim fertility in all those areas that are located within its reach.
The riverine area of the Indus is inundated whenever such flows start passing the barrages, and they are beneficial for it. At the same time, forests benefit too. According to the
forest department’s website
, out of Sindh’s total land mass of 14.099 million hectares or 34.84m acres, an area of 1.384mha or 3.426m acres is under the forest department’s control, making up 9.83pc of the total land of the province. Of this area, riverine forests and irrigated plantations cover only 2.29pc, clearly indicating that Sindh is deficient in forestry resources.

These riverine areas also contribute substantially to crop production, with increased flows naturally benefiting the area’s soil. “If water flows increase and are termed high flood, the riverine area, which is considered part of the river, gets inundated.
“It’s absolutely normal, in fact, a lifeline for the river. This helps maintain the ecosystem, biodiversity, forests and aquifer,” explained Mahmood Nawaz Shah, president of the Sindh Abagdar Board (SAB), a community of agriculturalists.
“Therefore, it’s normal that some crops get impacted, which are essentially in the riverine area. The quantum of water is huge, but not abnormal for the river at this time,” he added.
Under threat
On the flip side, the riverine floods trigger relocation and displacement of
katcha
dwellers.
Katcha
, a term frequently used in the revenue department’s records, refers to areas located inside the Indus river’s dykes on both sides. Millions of people have lived in these areas for centuries, right from the Guddu to the Kotri barrages.

Recently, the Sindh chief minister announced an evacuation strategy for the population living in the
katcha
area, considering the variations in river flows passing the three barrages. “It is in our mind to protect lives and livestock under any circumstances,“ CM Murad Ali Shah
told a press conference
earlier. “Whether the waters are 800,000 [cusecs] and 900,000 or God forbid more than that, our entire
katcha
area will drown, so we will need to evacuate people from there,” he said.
Shama Bagri, a member of a nomadic community, resides with her family in Palari village, located in the Hussainabad area. A small hut covered with a patchwork of discoloured rags serves as her shelter on the left bank of the Indus river. “We settled here from Tando Mohammad Khan to eke out a living by selling fruits or doing daily wage labour,” said Bagri, whose hut sits atop a small mound a few feet away from the river.

Around 35 Bagri families have settled in this reach of the riverine area. Premo Bagri is another one of them. For now, he is convinced that the river will not cause any harm to him or other families in his community. “When the water flow peaked last year, the river reached a certain height,“ he said, pointing at stones dumped near a water pumping facility, run by a municipal body that lifts supplies of potable water to the city.
For him, the facility serves as a benchmark for when the water level crosses a certain threshold and necessitates temporary shifting to higher ground. “When the water level starts rising, we notice it. I look at the Indus from here and make my own assessment … I am not worried as of today,” he added.
A guessing game
For the past few days, the arrival of floodwaters — downstream Punjab through eastern rivers — has become a guessing game for authorities. Irrigation authorities are making assessments after examining discharges in the eastern rivers of the country. The Chenab river
reached a peak
of around 1.75m cusecs last week, prompting the Sindh government to prepare for a
‘very high’ or ‘super flood’
.
Kotri is the last barrage on the mighty Indus in Sindh. After the river passes the barrage, it enters the Arabian Sea in the coastal district of Thatta through various creeks. Since July, the Indus river has remained in a flood-like state.

This year, Sindh’s two main barrages — Guddu and Sukkur — have already experienced
medium and high floods
in July and August. Now, authorities are bracing for another flood, with the Sindh chief minister highlighting in his presser on Sunday that while Guddu has already
recorded a peak
of 550,000 cusecs on Aug 24 in the Indus, the government is preparing for the worst-case scenario.
“Weather patterns can go anywhere. Nobody knows how hill torrents will behave, as was seen in Koh-e-Suleman range when floodwaters were entering Sindh back in 2010,” he
told the media
in Sukkur. According to him, the Sindh government is preparing itself for a super flood having a quantum of 900,000 cusecs or above under a comprehensive strategy.

Meanwhile, per the irrigation department’s figures, the Guddu barrage in Sindh has a designed discharge capacity of 1.2m cusecs, followed by the Sukkur barrage’s 900,000 cusecs and Kotri’s 875,000 cusecs. The Sukkur barrage, at the time of construction, had a designed discharge capacity of 1.5m cusecs, but due to silt accumulation upstream, 10 of its gates had to be closed, thus reducing its capacity to 900,000 cusecs.
The last time the Guddu and Sukkur barrages
passed a super flood
was 15 years ago. On August 8, 2010, Guddu had passed a flow of 1,148,200 cusecs downstream after receiving a flow of 1,148,738 cusecs upstream; Sukkur passed 1,108,795 cusecs downstream after having 1,130,995 cusecs upstream the same day. Meanwhile, Kotri barrage passed 939,442 cusecs downstream on Aug 27, 2010, following 964,897 cusecs upstream.
This was not, however, without spelling disaster. The Aug 7, 2010, infamous
breach at Tori dyke
on the right bank of the Indus upstream Guddu barrage had wreaked havoc for districts on the right bank of the river. Twenty days on, another
breach at Kot Almo
downstream Kotri barrage had caused further destruction.

Provincial authorities are currently observing flow patterns at the Trimmu barrage and the upstream Panjnad barrage, both located in Punjab. According to Pakistan’s river system mapping, Panjnad barrage is the location where the water from all rivers — Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej — gather and then head for Sindh via the Guddu barrage. At this stage, the flows of the Chenab River are likely to precede the flows of Ravi and Sutlej insofar as arrival at Guddu is concerned.
According to the Flood Forecasting Division’s river flows chart, Trimmu, which was showing a rising trend until last night, is now falling constantly. It has a designed discharge capacity of 875,000 cusecs. It is currently receiving floodwaters generated in Chenab, invariably 10,77,951 cusecs that passed through Khanki and Qadirabad last week. The travel distance for water between Trimmu and Panjnad — the final destination in Punjab before the eastern river flows would enter in the Indus — is around 48 hours. It would then take another 24 hours to reach Mithan Kot, from where they hit the Guddu barrage.

At 4pm on Monday, the discharge downstream Trimmu was recorded at 550,965 cusecs, according to the FFC river flow situation’s chart. But by noon today, the downstream discharge fell to 445,712 cusecs after reaching 516,313 cusecs at 8am. With this flow, Trimmu is perhaps recording a falling trend only to lessen pressure on Guddu ultimately for the authorities.
On the other hand, the Panjnad downstream outflow was recorded at 101,664 cusecs on Tuesday noon, while the Guddu barrage started showing a rising trend at the same time with an inflow of 360,777 cusecs upstream and 345,373 cusecs downstream. A flow that passes downstream at any barrage is considered a flood, considering different categories defined based on river flows.
The storage at Tarbela dam, which remains the principal source of water for Sindh, is being maintained at 1,500 — its optimum level, according to the FFC. Not only this, but the Chashma barrage over the Indus is also holding water to some extent, and its level has risen over the last few days from 647ft to 648ft to help Sindh manage floodwaters from the eastern rivers.
While the flood waters may have reignited hope for farmers and other fishermen in the regions, katcha dwellers wait with bated breath, bracing themselves for yet another year of destruction and displacement.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944467/unacknowledged-heroes,Unacknowledged heroes - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"A RECENT encounter with the UK’s All Party Parliamentary Group for Bees, Pollinators and Invertebrates has revealed something remarkable: British parliamentarians have formed a cross-party group specifically acknowledging invertebrates’ profound connection with climate change, biodiversity, trade and human health.
This initiative raises crucial questions about Pakistan’s own invertebrate populations. As our country experiences frequent floods, droughts and heatwaves, how are these climatic extremes affecting the unsung architects of our ecosystems? What implications do these impacts hold for Pakistan’s food security and public health?
In Pakistan, the global and national significa­­n­­ce of insects and invertebrates is profound yet ov­­erlooked and critically threatened. Their collective work underpins the very foundations of life: from pollinating the crops that feed us to decomposing organic matter that enriches our soils.
These unrecognised heroes of ecosystems are indispensable to biodiversity and food security. Pakistan’s diverse ecology, from the Himalayas to the Indus delta, is home to a wide range of invertebrates crucial to environmental and economic health. As the backbone of the country’s agriculture, insect pollinators are vital for such crops as fruit, vegetables and cotton.
Beyond farming, insects play crucial roles in nutrient cycling in arid zones and maintaining the delicate balance of alpine flora. Aquatic invertebrates serve as indicators of water quality and support aquatic food chains in our water bodies. While credible data is hard to come by, some species like the Kashmir Kaiser-i-Hind butterfly are considered globally threatened. Threats to these species are multifaceted.
In Pakistan, the significance of insects and invertebrates is profound yet overlooked.
Bees are the most critical pollinators, enabling the reproduction of major food crops and wild flowering plants. Without them, farm yield would plummet. Beyond pollination, insects like ladybugs are natural pest controllers, reducing the need for chemical pesticides. Beetles and earthworms, known as detritivores, decompose organic matter, enriching soil and preventing erosion.
They also form the base of food chains, supporting birds, amphibians and mammals. The decline of insect populations is a crisis.
Impact of floods:
Floods
, like the recent ones in Pakistan, cause mass invertebrate mortality, as widespread floods and prolonged inundation drown or wash away vast numbers of terrestrial insects and their nests. These events also lead to habitat destruction, as floodwaters destroy the plants and soil that invertebrates rely on for food and shelter. The water itself, often polluted, can be toxic in Pakistan.
Phenological mismatch and species migration: Perhaps most concerning is the slow climatic on­­set of phenological mismatches: the decoupling of synchronised relationships between insects and their food sources. As temperatures shift, bees may emerge from hibernation before their preferred flowers bloom, while butterfly lifecycles become misaligned with host plant availability. Across Pakistan’s seven elevation zones, from the Thar desert to the Karakorams, these mismatches create unpredictable ecosystem dynamics.
Climate change has also triggered a northward movement of species. Rising temperatures and al­­tered precipitation patterns have enabled disease vectors like mosquitoes to establish their ha­­bitat in previously cooler, higher-altitude regi­ons. Stu­dies in Islamabad and Peshawar show increasing dengue transmission risk as these vectors colonise northern Pakistan, while native invertebrate populations struggle with changing conditions.
Invertebrate wealth: Pakistan’s diverse ecosystems host a range of invertebrates crucial for environmental and economic resilience. Native bee species serve as the backbone of agriculture, pollinating key export crops like cotton, fruit and oilseeds. The economic value of these pollination services is invisible in the national account.
Beyond agriculture, many unique species represent significant biodiversity assets and potential flagships for ecotourism in northern Pakistan. Aquatic invertebrates serve as vital indicators of water quality throughout our river systems, while beneficial insects like ladybugs provide natural pest control.
Growing international trade in invertebrates presents both opportunities and risks. Pakistan could develop indigenous biocontrol solutions for export while expanding its managed pollination services sector. The commercial production and harvesting of insects have emerged as a major trade commodity.
However, unregulated trade poses biosecurity threats, as seen with the global spread of Varroa mites that have devastated honeybee populations worldwide. While Pakistan also grapples with illegal wildlife trafficking of mammals and reptiles, invertebrate commerce requires distinct regulatory frameworks due to its unique biosecurity and ecological implications.
Governance gaps: Pakistan addresses invertebrate protection through multiple agencies, primarily the ministries of climate change and food security. Key legislation includes the Pakistan Plant Quarantine Act (1976) and the Pakistan Trade Control of Wild Fauna and Flora Act (2012) aligned with CITES. However, significant gaps re­­main.
Despite research conducted by the Ento­mo­logical Research Institute and various universit­ies, the Pakistan Zoological Survey lacks a centr­a­­lised national dataset for monitoring invertebr­ate populations — a critical oversight given their importance to agricultural and food security.
Conservation priorities: Protecting Pakistan’s invertebrates requires immediate action across four fronts: conducting nationwide population su­­r­veys and enhanced entomological research to un­­derstand climate vulnerabilities; strengthening protected areas and converting lands along railway tracks and road networks into ecological corridors linking fragmented habitats; impleme­n­ting agricultural reforms that reduce pesticide de­­­pendency through integrated pest managem­ent, while incentivising pollinator-friendly farming; and, developing a unified national action plan integrated into climate strategies. Crucially, Pakistan’s NDCs and national adaptation plans must prioritise investment in bees and pollinators as essential climate resilience components.
The invertebrate crisis threatens our food security, economic stability and ecological resilience. The
2022
and
2025
floods exposed this catastrophic vulnerability while also demonstrating invertebrates’ essential role in ecosystem recovery. As climate change intensifies phenological mismatches and drives species’ migration or extinction, I cannot imagine a healthy childhood without chasing butterflies and fireflies or running away from wasps.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939500/pakistans-first-womens-software-technology-park-inaugurated-in-muzaffarabad,Pakistan’s first women’s software technology park inaugurated in Muzaffarabad - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"MUZAFFARABAD: The Special Communications Organisation (SCO), a public-sector telecom provider in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), on Wednesday launched the country’s first dedicated Women’s Software Technology Park at Fatima Jinnah Women’s Postgraduate College in downtown Muzaffarabad.
The facility was inaugurated by SCO Director General Maj-Gen Umar Ahmed Shah at a ceremony attended by AJK Prime Minister’s Coordinator Asma Andrabi, Secretary Information Technology Rashid Hanif, Director Public Instruction Colleges Prof Dr Khawaja Abdul Rehman, Muzaffarabad Station Commander Brig Qaiser, SCO Sector Commander Col Yousaf Javed, Principal Huma Mufti and a large number of officials, faculty members and students.
Designed exclusively for women, the park offers a modern, secure and fully equipped workspace for freelancers, IT professionals and entrepreneurs. It aims to generate employment, foster entrepreneurship and build technical capacity, thereby contributing to women’s social and economic empowerment.
After the inauguration, Maj-Gen Shah toured various sections of the park, interacted with young freelancers and praised their work. He also appreciated the state-of-the-art facilities, including uninterrupted electricity, high-speed internet and advanced training infrastructure, which he said would ensure a professional environment for women.
“The establishment of a dedicated technology park for women reflects SCO’s Vision 2025, which seeks to enhance women’s participation in technology and enable them to play a significant role in Pakistan’s growing digital economy,” he said.
He noted that under IT Vision 2025, SCO had established 17 software technology parks and 76 freelancing hubs across Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan over the past 20 months, creating more than 7,000 jobs and empowering over 1,500 freelancers.
By the end of the current month, he added, the network would be expanded to 100 centres.
The Muzaffarabad park — 8th in AJK — was aimed at bridging the digital divide, encouraging women-led startups and boosting Pakistan’s IT exports by showcasing the potential of AJK’s youth, he said.
Ms Andrabi congratulated SCO on what she called a “historic achievement” and said the project would always be remembered as a milestone in women’s empowerment.
She commended the organisation for providing a dedicated space for women freelancers, recalling that in the past, they had faced numerous obstacles in pursuing IT careers.
“Now, with a safe and culturally secure environment, they have an easy pathway to compete with the international community and prove their talent,” she said.
She expressed the hope that AJK’s women, particularly students, would use IT positively to move towards self-reliance and generate valuable foreign exchange for their families.
Meanwhile, Col Javed told
Dawn
that the Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) had earlier announced plans for a women-exclusive Software Technology Park at Women University Bagh and initially promoted it as the country’s first such facility.
However, since that project was still at least two months from completion, “it is SCO that now has the distinction of launching Pakistan’s first operational Women’s Software Technology Park with today’s inauguration in Muzaffarabad,” he said.

“On September 17 2025, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in the Khuzdar district of Balochistan, on reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy,
Fitna al Hindustan
,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as
Fitna-al-Hindustan
to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR statement said that during the operation, “own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location”, adding that “after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell”.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from slain terrorists, the ISPR said.
The terrorists were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”, it added.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area,” the statement read.
“Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” it added.
A day ago, the ISPR had issued another statement, saying that the armed forces had
eliminated
five “Indian sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Khuzdar earlier this week.
Yesterday, two police stations and a Levies station had also come under
attack
in Balochistan’s Sherani district. In those attacks, a policeman was martyred and two Levies personnel were injured.

The 25-year-old employee allegedly jumped from the eighth floor of the school building on September 1, according to a first information report (FIR) registered at Brigade police station.
According to the complainant, who was the victim’s brother, “On September 1, he (the victim) left home at around 8:15am for work. At around 9:35am, I received a phone call informing me that my brother’s health had deteriorated and he was being taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC).”
The complainant said that when he arrived at JPMC, the school’s administration staff was also present and they informed him that his brother fell from the eighth floor of the building at around 8:45am.
He added that when he reached the emergency room, he saw that his brother was dead.
“It later transpired that my brother had left a message on social media, naming three men who ‘mentally tortured’ him,” the complainant stated.
He alleged that his brother ended his life because of mental pressure and wanted to pursue legal action against the three people named in the social media post.
The police invoked Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 322 (punishment for manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code against the suspects.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the victim’s cause of death was “injury to thoraco-abdominal contents”.
She added that multiple bones found fractured in the body. “Thoraco-abdominal cavities found full of blood and there were lacerated wounds on the back,” she continued.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941834/iaea-backs-nuclear-solutions-for-climate-hit-agriculture-in-pakistan,IAEA backs nuclear solutions for climate-hit agriculture in Pakistan - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD:  Pakistan’s agriculture sector could mitigate and adapt to climate change through the use of nuclear technology, according to a recent assessment mission under the Atoms4Food Initiative — the first of its kind in Asia and the Pacific, launched by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The mission noted that climate change —  rising temperatures, erratic rainfall and more frequent extreme weather events — poses a threat to the production of staple crops such as wheat and rice, as well as cash crops including cotton.
Scarce irrigation water, soil degradation and growing pest populations are further straining food security for Pakistan’s 250 million inhabitants.
Pakistan was among the first in Asia and the Pacific region to commit to the  Atoms4Food Initiative since its launch in October 2023.
Atoms4Food initiative to help boost crop yields, food security
Following a request from the government, an assessment mission was organised by the IAEA and the FAO last month and its goals were to consult stakeholders and analyse country-level data to better understand Pakistan’s food security and agricultural resilience needs before ultimately making data-driven, country-specific recommendations.
The Atoms4Food  assessment mission found further potential to optimise and broaden the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices in the country.
This includes capacity building in efficient nutrient and water use practices, to enhance soil fertility and health, as well as reducing the carbon footprint of fertilisation.
Findings of the assessment mission will provide the basis for the development and implementation of a national Atoms4Food action plan, which will deliver support in the areas of research, transfer of technology and capacity building to empower national and local stakeholders for a more robust and resilient agri-food system, IAEA says in a bulletin.
Future cooperation with  Pakistan through the ‘Atoms4Food’ initiative will focus on upgrading local capacities in the use of nuclear technologies for the detection,  characterisation, and monitoring of animal diseases, zoonotic diseases and antibiotic resistance, and producing safe and effective vaccines against animal pathogens using irradiation.
“Despite contributing less than one per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, Pakistan is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing significant economic damage from extreme weather events,” said Secretary National Food  Security, Amir Mohyuddin.
“The agricultural sector, crucial to the  Pakistani economy, faces dire consequences, with some projections indicating a potential substantial loss in production if current practices continue, due to increasing temperatures and erratic rainfall patterns,” he said.
Building on Pakistan’s cooperation with the  FAO and IAEA to produce new and improved plant varieties, the assessment mission highlighted opportunities to integrate advanced technologies such as speed breeding and biotechnology into mutation breeding programmes for priority crops in Pakistan.
“Pakistan has used mutation breeding to create pest-resistant and drought-tolerant crops like chickpea, rice and cotton. We have employed nuclear techniques to improve soil fertility, we have reclaimed barren land, optimised fertiliser use for better yields and reduced costs, to give a few examples,” said Muhammad Yussouf Saleem, director general and chief scientist of the Agri & Biotech division of the Pakistan Atomic  Energy Commission (PAEC) and the national focal point in Pakistan for  Atoms4Food.
“The initiative will further expand our cooperation by engaging new partners and breaking silos across sectors with a whole value-chain approach,” he said.
Revitalising Pakistan’s seed system will also help capitalise on the improved plant varieties developed with FAO and IAEA support. The mission team recommended that national institutions and stakeholders across the value chain be trained to scale up the distribution and use of improved seeds, ensuring they reach farmers and translate into increased yields.
Soil degradation and inefficient use of water and nutrients further limit crop production — however, decades of cooperation with the IAEA has supported Pakistan’s Nuclear Institute for Agriculture and Biology in transforming salt-affected soils into productive farmland.
Without an effective system to test and control food safety, the export of agricultural produce from Pakistan remains difficult. A dearth of accredited testing capacities for mycotoxins, veterinary drugs and microbes is a bottleneck in Pakistan’s efforts to improve the safety of food products for foreign markets.
The assessment mission recommended scaling up monitoring capabilities and establishing a national plan to ensure safety across the food value chain.
A review of Pakistan’s analytical capacity for the application of stable isotope techniques in nutritional assessments revealed further opportunities to integrate nuclear technologies in informing evidence-based nutrition policymaking.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944550/terrorists-receive-state-patronage-in-afghanistan-sarfraz-bugti,Terrorists receive ‘state patronage’ in Afghanistan: Sarfraz Bugti - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Thursday that terrorists were receiving “state patronage” in Afghanistan, from where they launched attacks on Pakistan.
His comments come against the backdrop of a tumultuous security situation in Balochistan, which has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and
intensity
of their attacks. The banned so-called
Balochistan Liberation Army
(BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
Islamabad, for the last couple of years, has been insisting that terrorists use Afghan soil to
lauch attacks
across the country. Kabul, however, denies the allegations.
Responding to a question during a press conference in Islamabad, CM Bugti reiterated the state’s narrative and said, “Terrorists were provided safe havens and places to run training camps in Afghanistan.”
He highlighted that many among the recently killed terrorists were from Afghanistan.
The CM called on the Taliban rulers in Afghanistan to abide by the Doha agreement, in which, he said Kabul had “committed not to let your soil be used against any country”.
Bugti justifies 4G suspension
Earlier in the press conference, he shared details of a intelligence-based operation conducted in Chagai yesterday, in which he said two men were killed and another surrendered. Bugti said one of the two killed “terrorists” was a lawyer by profession.
He detailed that the lawyer was traced following some arrests over the killing of Pakistan Air Force men on May 8 in Dal Badin. “We observed him for two to three months and surrounded his house yesterday. Then, through a loud speaker, we asked him to surrender, and as soon as we did that, firing started from their end.”
A Federal Constabulary soldier was injured, and retaliatory firing by security personnel led to a fire exchange which went on for two to three hours, he said, adding that eventually two of the “terrorists” were killed and their third companion surrendered.
Answering a question, he alleged that efforts were being made to gather terrorist organisations in Balochistan. He went on to say that this was a “war” facilitated and funded by Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing. “They have foisted an intelligence-based war on us, and they are trying to bring together all those who want to destabilise Pakistan.”
Bugti also touched upon the
suspension of 4G mobile network services
in Balochistan.
“We faced criticism for suspending 4G services,” he said, clarifying that the authorities’ intention behind such moves was not to cause inconvenience for the people. “But, terrorists have started using means of communication that are beyond the capacity of our intelligence agencies,” he explained, adding that the suspension of mobile network services helped with tracking down and catching terrorists.
In response to another questioned, he stressed the need to distinguish between the “youth” who had not taken up arms and those who had  taken up arms with the intention to break Pakistan.
He questioned if an area was deprived of development and resources, should its people kill others. “How are you justifying violence on this basis? … We continue to link this violence to deprivation, unparalleled development, [violation of] human rights.”
Balochistan, where violence has been a problem for long, continues to face neglect in terms of development and resource availability as well. Human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International, have also
repeatedly called out the authorities
over action against rights activists, notably Baloch Yakjehti Committee’s Mahrang Baloch. Mahrang has particularly raised voice on the issue of missing persons.
Bugti also directed criticism toward her and said “there is a huge difference between self-disappearance and enforced disappearance”.
“Unfortunately, you continue to buy the narrative being peddled out here, without thinking that the reality may be different from perception,” he continued.
He also dispelled the impression that there “is a puppet government in Balochistan”.
The CM shared that the federal and Balochistan government had decided to carry out an exercise with the help of satellite images and would not get Pakistan’s poppy-free status get compromised.
He was also asked about the
reports
of killing of a terrorist identified as Rehman Gul in Afghanistan, who is said to be the mastermind of the
Jaffer Express attack
.
CM Bugti said these were unconfirmed reports. “It cannot be said that this is 100 per cent true. This is what we have been informed of from different sources … But I believe that this is a big success of ours, even if the reports are unconfirmed. Though, it seems they will be confirmed soon.”",2025-09-25,Dawn.com,1205,0.00015

A press release stated that the CHRI, the Commonwealth Journalists Association (CJA) and the Commonwealth Lawyers Association (CLA) called on member states to urgently repeal “laws that criminalise legitimate public speech” and take decisive action to protect media workers and watchdogs from violence and intimidation.
“The report

finds that criminal provisions for speech offences, including defamation and sedition, as well as violations of national security laws, are arbitrarily applied to intimidate and silence journalists, human rights defenders, and government critics,” the press release read.
“A key objective, the authors argue, must be to decriminalise defamation laws in 41 Commonwealth countries — many of which permit long prison sentences.”
According to the press release, the report is based on analyses of national legal frameworks and draws on testimonies from over 30 senior journalists and 35 lawyers across Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Caribbean, Europe and the Pacific regions.
The report concludes that the Commonwealth’s past inaction has “contributed to the serious and persistent challenges to the protection of freedom of expression and the rule of law in some member countries”.
The report urges the secretariat and member states to act resolutely, together with non-governmental organisations, to ensure observance of the 11-point Commonwealth Principles on Freedom of Expression and the Role of the Media in Good Governance adopted by Heads of Government in Samoa.
“These media principles call on governments to create a safe and enabling environment for media workers, and to review and consider amending unduly restrictive domestic laws that inhibit free speech both online and offline,” the press release read.
According to the press release, the report found that 213 journalists were killed in 19 Commonwealth countries between 2006 and 2023, and in 96 per cent of cases, the perpetrators were not brought to justice, according to Unesco figures.
It also found that 41 Commonwealth countries maintain criminal penalties for defamation; 48 retain laws related to sedition; and 37 have legislation regarding blasphemy, the press release stated.
“The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) is urged to fulfil its mandate to address systematic constraints on civil society and the media,” the press release read. “The CMAG should be reformed and supported by a Commonwealth Envoy on Freedom of Expression.”
The CHRI, CJA and CLA urged member states to develop action plans with state and non-state actors to accelerate the repeal of criminal legislation for speech and anti-state offences in line with international best practice.
“Collaborate with civil society and international human rights organisations, including UNESCO, to monitor and support the implementation of the Commonwealth Media Principles,” the three bodies urged, requesting that members prioritise the protection of civil and political rights.
As part of its recommendations, the report urged the following:
Strengthen legal frameworks
Align national legal frameworks with international human rights standards. Any restrictions on freedom of expression should comply with international human rights law
Ratify and implement international treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)
Enact robust right to information legislation
Enact appropriate defences to defamation laws.
Promote judicial independence, due process guarantees, and access to justice
Strengthen judicial independence
Combat impunity
Ensure access to effective remedies and that due process and fair trial guarantees are clearly set out in law and respected in practice
Adopt anti-Slapp (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) measures
Ensure media pluralism and protect digital rights
Establish and maintain independent media regulatory and oversight bodies
Promote media pluralism
Refrain from imposing internet or communications shutdowns or censorship of critical voices
Support digital literacy
Ensure online platforms abide with their human rights responsibilities
Protect journalists and foster a vibrant civil society
Protect journalists by strengthening national legal frameworks to address journalists’ safety and access to justice
Create an enabling environment for journalists and for civil society organisations
Establish safeguards against surveillance and intimidation of journalists.
Take special measures to protect disproportionately targeted groups, including women journalists
Support global and regional civil society initiatives
Protect freedom of association
Establish and strengthen accountability mechanisms
Strengthen the CMAG
Strengthen and adequately resource the Commonwealth Secretariat
Establish a Commonwealth Special Envoy on Freedom of Expression
Engage with international and regional human rights institutions and mechanisms
Join and engage with the Media Freedom Coalition
“Too many Commonwealth countries continue to enforce colonial-era laws that criminalise speech and silence dissent, in clear violation of their international obligations,“ Sneh Aurora, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative director, was quoted as saying.
“The media principles adopted by [the] heads of government in Samoa provide a timely opportunity for member states to take concrete steps — through law reform and institutional safeguards — to protect freedom of expression and align national laws with international human rights standards.”
William Horsley of the CJA said: “The almost complete failure of Commonwealth countries to prosecute and punish those responsible for the killings of over 200 journalists in 20 years is shameful.
“This culture of impunity must be swept away. A genuine Commonwealth engagement to protect the truth-tellers from threats and reprisals would give the organisation a vital new sense of purpose at a time when the concept of truth is under fierce attack.”",2025-09-09,Dawn.com,1565,0.000177

However, this video is not from Pakistan and shows two Vietnamese siblings.
A day ago, a video showing a young girl with a baby was shared on
X
by a user sharing Islamophobic content, based on their past posts.
The caption of the post said: “Pakistan: Islam is a Cult Religion. How sad … A shocking case has emerged in Pakistan where an 11-year-old girl was married to a 60-year-old man and gave birth at age 12. Really, Islam is sexual child abuse religion!”
This post was viewed by over 16 million users.

also shared a similar post with the same claim, which received over 102,000 views.
Additionally, several other users on X widely circulated the same claim as can be seen

, collectively gaining over 110,000 views.
Notably, the posts did not provide any other contextual details, such as the date and location of the alleged incident.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and to address the harm that such allegations can cause.
A keyword search to corroborate whether the incident recently occurred or not in Pakistan yielded no results from credible national or local news outlets reporting any such occurrence.
Observing the video itself showed that the people were not speaking any language or dialect used in Pakistan.
A reverse image search led to a

false
. The video shows a young Vietnamese girl with her baby sibling and was shared back in August 2024.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945000/kp-govt-does-not-support-operations-gandapur-tells-centre-at-pti-rally-in-peshawar,"KP govt does not support ‘operations’, Gandapur tells Centre at PTI rally in Peshawar - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who is a senior PTI leader, asserted on Saturday that his provincial government did not support any operation — a reference to military action in various parts of the province against militants.
Addressing a PTI rally in Peshawar, he said, “We will not allow any operation and do not support it … Federal government, listen. The KP government does not support operation or displacement.”
Gandapur called on the “federal institutions” to talk to Afghanistan and resolve the issue of terrorism in the country.
“We don’t want war and we will raise our voice against it,” he added.
Gandapur has been shifting positions on the matter.
In July, he
said
in a heavily-edited video message that the armed for­ces were in the province at the request of the KP government and should be treated as “guests” and with respect.
This came in complete contrast to another video statement issued by him following a PTI parliamentary meeting a day ago, in which he said that innocent civilians were martyred in a military offensive launched against militants in Bajaur district. He added that such operations had a negative impact and eroded trust between people and the forces.
Meanwhile, the PTI remained opposed to military action.
More recently on Tuesday, he
said
that mortar shelling, drone strikes and using fighter jets against terrorists was the constitutional right of the military and that the provincial government could not stop it.
Gandapur calls for justice
At the rally today, the KP CM also urged the judiciary to serve justice in line with the Constitution. “Deliver justice to Imran Khan, his wife and the people,” Gandapur said.
The CM further stated that PTI’s struggle for ‘
Haqeeqi Azadi
’ would continue until it achieved success.
Addressing army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, he said, “It is obligatory on you to play your role and sort out Imran’s issue” just as the PTI founder had played his role during the May conflict with India asked the people to stand with the armed forces.
Earlier the rally, PTI leader Faisal Javed announced that “video messages” from Imran would be played at the rally.
“In a while, Imran Khan will speak to you on this screen, Peshawar,” he said.
Later, a video of an address by Imran was played, but it seemed to be from a previous public gathering.
Party leader Azam Swati also addressed the gathering and vowed to stand tall and “continue to bear cruelty and barbarity” until Imran’s release from jail. He expressed the hope that Imran would soon come out of jail and lead the country towards development, prosperity and peace.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan lauded the party’s followers for standing together during the brief war with India in May.
“This is the eighth rally since the elections and Pakistan has changed greatly since February 8,” he said. “In May, despite (Imran) Khan
sahib
being wrongfully imprisoned and not allowed to see his family, you stood with the rest of Pakistan and defeated our thuggish enemies.”
Gohar added that the PTI lost its mandate in these elections, but said that Imran was confident the courts would restore it. However, he continued that “the 26th Constitutional Amendment killed that hope”.
“Our rally is not a power show. The world is saying that 90 per cent of people are in favour of Khan
sahib
— 200 million people rise at his call,” the PTI chairman said. “They want to demand one thing: this rally is for us to raise our voices and show our concerns. Injustice in one place means injustice will be everywhere.”
Quoting Imran, Gohar demanded free courts, a strong parliament and democracy.
“It is your duty to hear our voice,” he emphasised, addressing the government. “Do not silence the voice of 90pc of our people; end injustice, end military operations; end these wrongful convictions. We want justice. We have approached the courts for it and will continue to fight for it.”
He closed out his speech with a message from the PTI founder: “I will not compromise or make deals, I will not bend and I will remain in this country. But as long as I am here, I will stand up and live my life and will not let my country bend the knee.”
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram delivered a fiery speech branding the federal government “thieves and killers” and slamming the Punjab government’s flood relief efforts.
“Today, [Imran] Khan has called you all here … it is his rally. This is a rally for a man who has been stripped of his rights and locked in prison for standing for the right thing and sacrificing for future generations,” Akram said, addressing the crowd.
“He endures every problem, mistreatment and 22-hour isolation, but remains standing in the face of it all.”
The party spokesperson said that if there were true freedom, PTI figures including Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub, Ahmed Bachar, Aliya Hamza, Ayesha Bhutta, Khadija Shah, Zartaj Gul, Dr Yasmin Rashid and Sanam Javed would not have been “jailed for 10 years”.
“Why did this happen? Because there is no true freedom. This is a government of slaves, thieves and mandate stealers,” Akram declared. “If there were true freedom, what happened to the flood victims at the hands of this shameless government would not have happened.
“Look at what the KP government — Imran Khan’s government — has done: we disbursed billions to flood victims and rehabilitation has started. In Punjab, [Punjab Chief Minister] Maryam Nawaz has not even completed the initial survey. She is a liar, chasing photo-ops.”
Akram impressed on the crowd that “these people are not your leaders”.
“They are thieves and killers; they murdered your vote. Will you endorse these murderers? Will you condemn them?”
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja took to the stage, emphasising that his party will not end its struggle until the “system of oppression” is brought down.
“I was sitting with Imran Khan in Adiala Jail. I asked him what message he has for you all. He said: ‘Tell my nation that I will never bend before hardship. I am in jail because I value every drop of blood my nation sheds’,” Raja said.
“Today, KP is drenched in blood: ours, the innocents and that of our martyrs. Balochistan, Punjab, Sindh, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan are all drenched in blood. Oppression is everywhere.”
Raja paid tribute to martyrs, stating that “their mothers’ tears are our tears”.
“The martyrs of Tirah ask when this system of oppression will end,” he declared, referring to those affected by a recent airstrike in KP’s Tirah area. “I bring a message from Imran Khan: our struggle, our movement, will only end when the oppression does.”
Raja then demanded the release of the PTI founder, as well as other party leaders and activists, who he said were “imprisoned without rights” and given “false punishments by military tribunals”.
PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser said that the people of KP demand only one thing and that is peace.
“We will not allow military operations in our province under any circumstances,” he emphasised. “We are tired of wars; we will not be a part of one.”
Qaiser also demanded that the federal government settle matters with Afghanistan through diplomatic channels and jirgas.
“We in KP and Afghanistan share deep relations, so we want trade and relations so that there is peace and jobs in our province,” he stated. “I am hopeful that Ali Amin Gandapur will convince this ‘Form 47’ federal government to do so.”
The PTI leader and ex-national assembly speaker noted that there needs to be peace in this region.
“We appreciate the Saudi pact, but if this country is going to progress, then it needs to establish trade relations with regional nations.”
Rally arrangements
According to information shared by the PTI on
social media
, party workers and supporters have reached Peshawar from across the country to participate in the rally.
While television channels did not air it, the PTI employed social media to broadcast the event online.
Earlier, a statement issued by the office Peshawar Chief Capital Police Officer Mian Saeed Ahmed detailed the security and traffic plan ahead of the rally.
The statement read that 1,451 police personnel would be deployed as part of security arrangements and sniper shooters would be stationed on the roofs of the buildings round the rally’s venue.
Meanwhile, 508 traffic personnel would be deployed at different spots under the traffic plan, the statement said.
Several PTI leaders
visited
the rally’s venue and examined arrangements before the event. They included Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan and PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar.
Ahead of the gathering, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said on Friday that the party’s rally in Peshawar would raise a strong voice across the country against lawlessness, constitutional violations and restrictions on freedom of speech.

• Azma Bokhari accuses PPP of indulging in ‘flood politics’
• PPP leaders lash out at JI chief’s BISP ‘fraud’ remarks
LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: The war of words between coalition partners PML-N and PPP escalated on Wednesday after the former questioned the transparency of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), while the latter accused its senior partner of showing an “
irresponsible attitude
” by refusing to use the programme’s data to compensate flood-affected people in Punjab.
Several PPP leaders criticised the PML-N for “attempting to make the BISP controversial”. On Wednesday, PPP’s Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari — the first lady and a member of the National Assembly — entered the debate, questioning what she called the PML-N’s “unfounded concerns” in refusing to use BISP data to provide relief to flood victims in Punjab.
“Over four million people have been impacted by the unprecedented floods in Punjab. The Benazir Income Support Programme is the fastest and most effective way to distribute relief. Not utilising one of the state’s key organisations, which has both the data and the capacity to deliver assistance, would be irresponsible,” Aseefa wrote on X.
Senior PPP leaders Nadim Afzal Chan and Chaudhry Manzoor Ahmed — while addressing a press conference in Islamabad — also lambasted the Punjab government for rejecting BISP data for compensating flood victims.
Taking a jibe at Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, Mr Chan said that regardless of whose picture appeared on the relief package, the flood-affected people, especially farmers, should be compensated forthwith. He also advised CM Maryam to consult farmers regarding the compensation package.
Maryam Nawaz has often been criticised for putting her picture on every Punjab government project.
Mr Chan said the Punjab government was shirking its responsibility of helping poor farmers affected by
recent floods
. He stressed that BISP was the only welfare initiative in Pakistan that had won international recognition.
Chaudhry Manzoor underscored that only BISP had the infrastructure to reach down to the union council level. “Apart from BISP, no other mechanism has such reach,” he claimed.
PPP Vice President Sherry Rehman, too, strongly advocated the use of BISP for compensating flood victims during a Senate committee meeting. BISP is a national safety net programme in Pakistan that provides cash assistance to poor and vulnerable families, particularly targeting women.
PML-N reaction
Responding to the criticism, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said in a statement on Wednesday that some elements of the PPP had done nothing except indulge in “flood politics” and point-scoring.
“The PPP is trying to drag BISP into politics. The programme functions under its own law and mechanisms. To repeatedly link it with floods is nothing more than political point-scoring,” she said, adding that the PPP had no solutions for people’s problems and was only interested in “flood politics”.
Ms Bokhari accused the PPP leaders of dictating from their homes which embankments the Punjab government should break. “Governments make such decisions based on prevailing circumstances and ground realities, not on political statements,” she remarked.
A day earlier, the minister had clarified that the Punjab government would
issue
relief cards to flood victims in their personal names, using its own resources, instead of using BISP for assistance.
So far, the Punjab government has announced a compensation package for flood-hit families, including Rs20,000 per acre for crop loss, Rs1 million for completely destroyed homes, Rs500,000 for partially damaged homes, and Rs500,000 for the loss of cattle.
PPP condemns JI emir’s remarks
Meanwhile, the PPP on Wednesday strongly condemned Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman’s remarks branding BISP a “fraud”.
A day after BISP chairperson Senator Rubina Khalid rebuked the JI emir over his remarks, PPP leaders Nadeem Afzal Chan and Chaudhry Manzoor denounced his statement in strong terms.
Mr Chan alleged that JI had recruited innocent citizens in the name of Afghan jihad and collected billions of rupees for a project that ultimately failed.
“Was Jamaat-i-Islami’s jihad project a success or a failure?” he asked, claiming that JI had sacrificed innocent lives in a futile war.
Mr Manzoor accused JI of exploiting the poor by pushing them into Ziaul Haq’s so-called jihad project. “That project was fraudulent, a failure, and history has proven it. JI even won seats in elections under its cover. They must stick to politics instead of exploiting people’s lives,” he remarked.

unplanned growth
, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Thursday said the provincial government was spearheading a comprehensive, World Bank-backed master plan focusing on transport, water supply, drainage, waste management, and other critical sectors.
Speaking to the media after visiting Mazar-i-Quaid on the 77th death anniversary of the country’s founder, he said that studies for the master plan had been completed. These cover vital components such as transport, electricity, water supply, drainage, waste management and overall development.
Stressing the need for humane solutions to the city’s unregulated expansion, the chief minister said that no resident of informal settlements along the Lyari River would be displaced without adequate support and resources.
Mr Shah said that infrastructure upgrades under the master plan included construction on Bhutto Road, a 39 km highway linking Qayyumabad to the M9 Motorway,” he said, adding that the new road and a two-kilometre link road were under construction, with 15km currently in safe active use.
“The Shahrah-i-Bhutto project is valued at Rs52 billion under a public-private partnership, managed by developers, engineers, financial institutions, and project managers,” he said.
Discussing recent
flooding
in parts of Karachi, the chief minister said that water pressure issues had been addressed by raising retaining walls, with ongoing monitoring under his supervision.
He added that flood warnings for the border areas between Sindh and Balochistan had not been forecasted. “Water flowed through feed channels onto the Motorway / Superhighway and Saadi Town,” he said, adding that infrastructure challenges along the motorway were being addressed through ongoing interventions, with water crossing permissions still pending.
The CM also said that while Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan had suffered damage by floods, the Sindh government was taking all possible steps to minimise losses. “Safety of people’s lives and protection of barrages and embankments remain top priorities,” he reiterated.
Mr Shah described the Sukkur Barrage as facing an unprecedented situation where 10 gates had to be closed after three years. “Instead of simply closing the gates, concrete was used to seal them, showcasing engineering innovation,” he said.
Originally designed to withstand 1.5 million cusecs flows, the barrage’s capacity was reduced to 960,000 cusecs after the closure of these gates. “To date, the flow through the barrage has reached 1.1 million cusecs,” he said.
He added that ongoing maintenance efforts focused on gate replacement, critical to the barrage’s longevity. “For the first time since its construction, the barrage floor was opened and repaired to extend its durability,” he noted.
He explained that following the floods of 2011, 2012 and 2022, efforts had been made to clear blockages and enhance infrastructure on both banks of major water bodies, including Manchhar Lake.
Acknowledging the global challenges of flood management, Mr Shah stressed the need for unity, a positive outlook, and consistent political will. “Water projects require both technical expertise and sustainable political commitment,” he said.
CM Shah stressed that Pakistan could progress towards development and stability by adhering to the principles of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
He lauded the recent show of national unity in the face of Indian aggression in May, and strongly condemned ongoing Indian atrocities in Held Kashmir, as well as Israeli aggression in Palestine and Qatar.

The floodwater has submerged over 200 villages in Jalalpur Pirwala, Lodhran, and Uch Sharif, leading to evacuations and severing critical transport links, including the M-5, which has been
closed
for 15 days.
The National Highway Authority (NHA) is reinforcing the motorway with stone barriers to prevent further damage. Local connectivity has also been severely disrupted, with Jalalpur Pirwala cut off from Lodhran and Uch Sharif as key roads, including Gilani Road where the controlled breach was not plugged.
Jalalpur Pirwala, Lodhran and Bahawalpur are particularly affected, with villages such as Noraja Bhutta, Basti Lang, Kotla Chakar, Bahadurpur, and Dunyapur surrounded by stagnant water reaching the height of eight to 10 feet.
Floodwater stuck between the M-5 and Noraja Bhutta embankment affecting 200 villages
Nasir Khan Baloch, a resident of Kotla Chakar, says the water is continuously rising along the eastern side of the M-5 and their houses are collapsing.
“The Noraja Bhutta embankment is not plugged yet and it would take 10 more days to close the breaches, which meant that their homes would completely collapse due to standing water.”
He said they were living along the Gilani Road and their entire village would be destroyed completely.
“The water is not passing through culverts of M-5 motorway and stones are also placed to close these culverts. How will the water recede from our areas in coming days when it does not find a way to reach the Chenab River?” he posed a question to the authorities concerned.
Muhammad Bakhsh, a resident of Basti Lang, says the water would not recede until the government does not breach the motorway.
“Already all of our belongings have been destroyed and it is becoming challenging to live in camps.” He says they would not forget this situation created by different state departments.
When contacted, the NHA, irrigation department and district administration officials for replies about the water creating a reservoir-like situation between the M-5 and Noraja Bhutta embankment, which was continuously diverting around 60pc of the Sutlej River water towards the motorway and rising the water level in around 200 villages, they were of the view that they were supporting each other to address the issue.
The irrigation chief says they are plugging the breaches at Noraja Bhutta embankment while district administration officials say that they are supporting the NHA and irrigation department to fill the breaches. The NHA chief is of the view that the authority has a mandate to protect the motorway and it would do it at any cost.
Rescue 1122 is providing transportation services in Jalalpur Pirwala, Basti Lang, Dua Chowk, and other affected areas. While no new evacuations reported in Jalalpur Pirwala over the past 24 hours, 150 transportation cases were assisted.
A Rescue 1122 spokesperson confirms that the evacuation phase is complete, and efforts are focused on transportation, with priority given to children, women, and the elderly.
Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu says emergency measures for the restoration of flood-damaged infrastructure in Jalalpur Pirwala are ongoing.
In this regard, the district administration has continuously stationed heavy machinery in Jalalpur Pirwala for restoration operations.
Mr Sindhu says that during a visit to the Jalalpur motorway section, he received a briefing from the authorities and inspected the repair work on the Sui gas pipeline service.
“The flood relief camps would remain established in Jalalpur Pirwala for public convenience until normalcy returns. All departments, including the NHA and Irrigation, are engaged in a joint operation to restore the infrastructure.”
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority reports that the Sutlej River’s water flow has normalised at all key monitoring points, including 40,000 cusecs at Ganda Singhwala and 55,000 cusecs at Suleimanki.
The PDMA says that the river’s flow has stabilised after two months of elevated levels and floodwaters are receding in affected areas.

illegal occupation
of the land of a temple and other properties of the board in Sargodha.
“On account of numerous complaints received in various properties concerning issues regarding corruption and malpractices committed resulting a bad name to the department – Sohail Ahmad (rent collector/LDC) office of ETPB Sargodha is relieved of his duties forthwith and directed to report to the board’s secretary for further order.
“The assistant commissioner ETPB Sargodha is directed to submit a detailed report of such cases and property matters wherein the said official committed illegalities and corrupt practices within a week so that disciplinary action is initiated against him,” an order of the ETPB said on Wednesday.
Earlier, PPP senior leader Nadeem Afzal Chan, in a video post on his X account, had alleged that the land of the temple in Bhalwal had been illegally occupied at the behest of a top bureaucrat of the Maryam Nawaz administration.
He also alleged that not only this land of the ETPB but the other ones in Bhera and Kot Momin (Sargodha) had also been illegally occupied by the nephews of that bureaucrat. The ETPB’s role remained dubious in the matter as questions are being asked how come illegal construction on the temple’s land was made possible.

The police lodged an FIR against the four kidnappers following an inquiry and initiated furtherinvestigations to trace and arrest them.
In his complaint to the police, the victim, Nadeem, a resident of Medical Society, said that he left his residence around 11am on Friday in his car, carrying Rs1.5 million cash, to make a payment.
He said in the Harbanspura area, four men in police uniform riding two motorbikes chased and intercepted his car.
Nadeem said that the suspects occupied the car seats on the pretext of searching the vehicle and later blindfolded him. He said that they took him to an unknown location, which seemed to be an outhouse.
The complainant said that the kidnappers initially demanded Rs100 million for his safe release and asked him to arrange the ransom amount. However, after negotiations, they agreed upon Rs50m.
He said that he called his friend Ali Raza, requesting him to arrange the amount, who said that he had only Rs2.5m. The kidnappers turned angry, but later settled for the amount.
The police say that the kidnappers told Nadeem and his friend Raza that they belonged to a dangerous criminal gang and would kill the former if ransom was not paid.
He said that his friend Raza paid Rs2.5m to the kidnappers, who also took away Rs1.5m he was carrying, and a two-tola gold chain he was wearing.
Nadeem said the kidnappers dropped him near Ring Road and drove away. Thevictim demanded the early arrest of the kidnappers.
A police official said that the investigation police are trying to trace the kidnappers with the help of the Punjab Safe Cities Authority cameras.

“At 1am this morning, a heavily armed raiding party of ICT police from Secretariat
thana
(police station) surrounded my home and asked for Imaan and Hadi. They were not there, and we informed them of the same. Cops said they had an FIR (first information report) against them and they should report to the
thana
. Eventually they left,” she posted on X.
In a subsequent post, she referred to a
protest
at the Islamabad High Court yesterday, where Imaan — who is a lawyer and rights activist — and others had raised slogans in support of judicial independence.
The lawyers had staged a protest on the premises of the IHC to oppose the
suspension of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from judicial work
.
Isl­a­mabad Bar Council member Ale­­em Abbasi, ex-president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) Riasat Ali and Imaan were prominent among the demonstrators.
However, tensions flared when — after the demonstration — PTI-affiliated lawyers, including Intizar Hussain Panjotha, Naeem Panjotha, and Fatehullah Barki, confronted IHCBA President Wa­­j­id Ali Gilani. Witnesses reported the PTI lawyers pushed Gilani, leading to an altercation, before IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jaja and other lawyers intervened.
The IHCBA president, accompanied by the secretary and bar council Vice Chairman Naseer Ahmed Kayani, later condemned the incident and announced that a reference would be sent to the bar council seeking the registration of a terrorism case against the lawyers concerned, as well as the cancellation of their licences.
He alleged that a group of lawyers, including Imaan, physically assaulted him, dragged him, and branded him a traitor. Gilani further claimed that they were armed and pressured him to support demands for filing cases against PTI foun­der Imran Khan, which he refu­sed. Jaja also claimed that the protest had been held without a formal requisition to the bar, in violation of due procedure.
Subsequently, police booked Imaan, Hadi and several PTI-linked lawyers under anti-terror laws.
Referring to the episode, Shireen Mazari posted on X that “all videos of the IHC protest yesterday show clearly the FIR charges are absolutely false. Eye witness accounts reveal the same. But persecution of Imaan and Hadi has become a daily routine by the state.”
Imaan, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, recently also
approached
inquiry committees of the IHC and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against IHC Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar.
The lawyer announced the development on X, saying that she had filed a complaint against the judge before the IHC’s workplace harassment committee and a reference for misconduct before the SJC.
This followed her
altercation
with Justice Dogar during a hearing earlier this month and his
subsequent remarks
over the exchange, which Imaan described as “sexist”.
Meanwhile, she and husband Hadi also face
charges
of alleged anti-state activities on social media.
Imaan was also among the voices
calling for a probe
into the allegations made by six IHC judges against interference in judicial affairs by the country’s intelligence apparatus in March.
The same month, an Islamabad court had issued
arrest warrants
for Mazari and Pashtun Tahaffuz Move­ment leaders Ali Wazir and Manzoor Pash­teen due to their repeated failure to appear in a case concerning an alleged anti-state march.",2025-09-20,Dawn.com,905,0.000128
https://www.dawn.com/news/1944882/two-men-confess-to-boys-rape-murder-in-karachi,"Two men confess to boy’s rape, murder in Karachi - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","KARACHI: Two men confessed before magistrates on Friday to raping a seven-year-old boy and murdering him by strangling him with a shoelace and striking him in the head with a brick.
The investigating officer (IO) produced both suspects before the judicial magistrate (East) and moved an application seeking to record their confessional statements.
As per Police Rules, Section 25.29, “When more than one person confesses or turns approver in a case, their confessions shall, if possible, be recorded by different magistrates and they shall not be allowed to meet one another till their evidence has been recorded in court.”
Before recording their statements, both magistrates gave the suspects sufficient time and asked them questions regarding their willingness to confess. The suspects made it clear to the court that they were giving their statements voluntarily.
After recording their confessional statements, the court concerned sent them to prison on judicial remand and directed the IO to submit the challan within the stipulated period.
The counsel for the complainant, Jahangir Kalhoro, told
Dawn
that both the suspects had confessed to their guilt, stating that on the day of the incident — Sept 18 — at around 7pm, they saw the boy returning from a relative’s house and then they invited him to visit their cattle farm, where both suspects used to work together.
After spending 15 to 20 minutes in the farm, both suspects sexually assaulted the boy in a room at the farm. They then attempted to strangle him with shoelaces before hitting him on the head with a brick and later attacking him with a heavy object, which led to his death, the counsel said.
They arranged a gunny bag and put the minor boy’s body into it, which was later recovered from an empty plot.
Responding to a question about the motive, Advocate Kalhoro said the suspects murdered the boy “brutally” after committing the offence “out of lust” as they wanted to conceal their crime.
He added that the suspects also had “personal enmity” with the complainant’s family, as they had earlier sought a marriage proposal from a relative of the deceased. After the complainant’s family refused, they developed grudges against them.
He further stated that the discovery of the body was communicated through a relative of one of the suspects, who personally contacted the ambulance driver on his phone, claiming that the ambulance service (Chippa) had no official record of such a call.
Responding to a query about whether more people could be implicated in the case, the counsel said that the investigation was ongoing, while the victim’s family believed others were also involved, including the wife of one suspect and his son-in-law, who had allegedly called the ambulance driver on his personal number.

DPO says nighttime convoy system already in place for safety of travellers
Meanwhile, the district administration imposed a ban on carrying and displaying any kind of arms and ammunition, directing the police department to provide foolproof security to processions to be taken out on Eid Miladun Nabi across the district.
A circular issued by Deputy Commissioner Mian Behzad Adil stated that a ban has been enforced on carrying and displaying arms, ammunition, explosives and any article that could be used for violence.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941036/gandapur-says-cant-travel-to-afghanistan-for-peace-talks-due-to-blocked-passport,Gandapur says can’t travel to Afghanistan for peace talks due to blocked passport - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur on Wednesday disclosed that his passport had been blocked since May 9, 2023, so he couldn’t travel to Afghanistan for holding peace talks with the interim Afghan government.
The disclosure came after Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan, in a tweet on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter),
directed
Mr Gandapur to visit Afghanistan and hold discussions with authorities regarding “mutual issues and peace and security to prevent the situation from deteriorating further.”
Besides Mr Imran, a multi-party consultative meeting hosted by Mr Gandapur on Feb 15 also underscored the importance of talks with Afghanistan at government level to establish peace in the country and demanded the formation of a jirga comprising religious and political figures for the purpose.
Talking to reporters after the “authentication” ceremony for the Provincial Assembly of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Procedure and Conduct of Business Rules, 2025, on the premises of the provincial assembly here, the chief minister said he tried to renew his passport but authorities refused to do so, saying it was blocked after the May 9, 2023, riots.
Complains he is not allowed to meet Imran in jail
He said he wanted to formally speak to the members of the interim Afghan government about peace and security and that it was still being worked upon.
Mr Gandapur, however, said it was beyond the provincial government’s mandate to hold national level talks with Afghan authorities.
“My requests for meetings with the PTI founder in jail are being declined. They [authorities] do not allow me to meet him, but let this message reach Mr Khan through the media that I will go to Afghanistan without a visa if Khan orders so,” he said.
Earlier, Speaker of the KP Assembly Babar Saleem Swati said his leader and PTI founder Imran Khan believed in the rule of the law.
He said assemblies were always run by the opposition as it pointed out issues and the treasury responded to them.
The speaker also thanked his National Assembly counterpart, Ayaz Sadiq, and all those involved in the framing of new rules of business.
He said the nation got independence but couldn’t “challenge and rectify the laws enacted during the colonial era.”
Mr Swati said anyone who considered any law unjustified could write to the petition committee, which would, through the standing committees, table laws in the assembly for changes.
“We will review all laws and will update everything,” he said, thanking the chief minister and cabinet members for their all-out support for smooth legislative business.
On the occasion, Mr Gandapur said that the rules of business were amended and that the reforms would benefit the entire province.
He said strong institutions could help a strong country.
“Lawmakers must try to come up with something that people remember, something that earns you a positive name. I have observed that what we discuss in the house is mostly about point scoring and criticising others instead of resolving issues,” he said.
The chief minister said that the house, meant for legislation, was also focusing on people’s development.
He wondered if a nation, under debt, could take its own decisions.
“Laws are enacted but not implemented. Once they’re implemented, it will help resolve issues,” he said.
On the occasion, provincial Governor Faisal Karim Kundi appreciated the role of the provincial assembly’s speaker and Deputy Speaker Suraya Bibi in efficiently running the rules committee. He was also all praise for the incumbent and previous members of the assembly, law department, assembly secretariat and office of the advocate general for the purpose.
“Let’s take this province in the right direction. Mr Speaker and the chief minister, let’s work together, jointly resolve the issues for peace and development of the province,” he said.
Leader of the Opposition in the provincial assembly Dr Ibadullah said that being a political worker, it was a historical day for political workers. He appreciated Mr Swati’s role for running the house according to the traditions and hoped the chief minister also behaved like the Speaker KP Assembly.
He said that man-made laws could be improved anytime and that the most important change in the rules was strengthening the house’s committees.
The event was also attended by former speakers, deputy speakers and current and former members of the assembly along with civil society members.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945613/court-orders-handover-of-17-baloch-children-to-parents,Court orders handover of 17 Baloch children to parents - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"SAHIWAL: The additional district and sessions judge (ADSJ) and presiding officer of the Child Protection Court, Sahiwal, has directed the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau (CPWB) to hand over custody of 17 minor children to their parents/guardians following due verification and recognition of the petitioners by the child.
The judge further instructed that custody be granted if the child’s identification satisfies the court, and proceedings should continue in accordance with the law.
This order was issued while disposing of the petition, titled Allah Yar vs the State, filed for the custody of a minor child through counsel, Muhammad Sajid Khan, in tehsil court Chichawatni.
Mr Akbar Ali Dhudi, the legal representative of the CPWB, was also present during the hearing. According to Muhammad Adnan, district officer CPWB, the parents arrived at the bureau’s office and the children were handed over to them following the court’s instructions.
The petition was filed on Sept 27 and was decided just yesterday evening prior to the handover.
It is learnt that the court conducted thorough verification of the parents, including checking their CNICs and asked each child about their parents. The judge also personally questioned the minors to confirm the identity of their parents. Muhammad Adnan added that the bureau had documented the handover by taking photographs of each child with their respective parents. The children were safely reunited with their families.
Earlier, the medical examination of 18 minor children —17 of whom belong to Balochistan — recovered from an unregistered orphanage in Chichawatni City earlier this week, was conducted this morning at the Sahiwal Teaching Hospital (STH).
According to official sources, a five-member medical board, led by Dr Muhammad Naeem Atta, additional medical superintendent, carried out the physical assessments and preliminary lab tests within the hospital premises.
Speaking to
Dawn
, Dr Atta confirmed that the board examined all children and that medical reports were expected within two days. The examination was ordered by Additional District and Sessions Judge Rana Tariq who had earlier transferred custody of the children to the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau (CPWB).
In a parallel legal development, the parents of the 17 children from Balochistan, through their counsel, appeared before the court of ADSJ Rana Tariq, seeking legal custody of their children.
The children were initially handed over to the CPWB after a disturbing video surfaced on local social media, showing a teacher brutally beating a 10-year-old boy with sticks on the premises of Ahmed Welfare Foundation, an unregistered orphanage.
Acting on the directives of the district police officer (DPO) Chichawatni, police
raided
the facility and arrested the teacher. Following the incident, the CPWB’s district office intervened, citing the orphanage’s illegal status and lack of registration both with the Social Welfare Department and CPWB.
The court subsequently issued a production order, enabling the CPWB to
recover
the children and place them under its care. Since then, the bureau provided food, clothing and shelter to the children and it enrolled them in Class I and II with books and uniforms.

“A search operation has been launched after the terrorist incident,” he said, adding that 12 suspects were detained in the operation and a large number of weapons were recovered from them.
“Terrorists will not be spared under any circumstances. No one will be allowed to disturb regional peace,” RPO Marwat stated.
Earlier today, Kurram District Police Officer Kurram Malik Habib Khan said that the unknown assailants fled the scene after the attack. “The bodies have been taken to the hospital,” he said, adding that an investigation into the incident was underway.
Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Hameed Hussain condemned the incident in a statement, calling it “an attempt to disrupt the peace of the area”.
“Such incidents are regrettable even after the establishment of check posts on the main highway,” he said.
Meanwhile, Haji Zamin Hussain, secretary of the Anjuman-e-Hussainia Parachinar, strongly condemned the attack, stating, “We are shocked at the incident as people of Kurram have been martyred.”
He expressed solidarity with the victims and called for “severe punishment” against the culprits. “We all should stand together to punish the perpetrators,” he said. He added that there has been “complete peace” in the Turi area and no incidents on the road over the past six months.
Kurram has been marred with tribal violence stemming from decades-old land disputes, which claimed at least 130 lives last year. Following months of
conflict

He was later remanded in police custody by a judicial magistrate.
According to a copy of the court order issued today, available with
Dawn.com
, police requested that the suspect be further remanded for eight days, but the court ordered three days.
“Learned counsel for the accused has opposed the request of the IO (investigating officer) and submitted an application that on a previous date, two days [of] physical remand was granted, thus the accused was supposed to be produced on [September 4], however, has been produced today,” the order read.
The court ordered that the suspect be produced before it on September 10.
The hearing
The suspect was produced in court before Duty Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Azhar Nadeem today after completing five days of physical remand. Police stated that the suspect had a two-day remand before his defence counsel, Chaudhry Zubair Gujjar, noted that the suspect had been produced after five days.
“We can see the first remand order,” Gujjar argued, to which police responded by saying that the two-day remand was a clerical error that was quickly resolved.
Meanwhile, the suspect’s transaction history with the social media influencer, as well as a video statement of her addressing her parents, were presented before the court.
“The suspect and the plaintiff are engaged,” Gujjar stated, showing photographs of their engagement.
However, the prosecution said that Rs45,000 had been recovered from the suspect and that his alleged accomplices needed to be arrested.
“[The suspect] got bail in one case but was deliberately arrested in another case,” Gujjar argued. “The suspect was in the Jinnah Super area at the time of the incident.
“When [the suspect] demanded money back from Samiya Hijab, false receipts were given,” he added.
The influencer alleged in a first information report (FIR) that the suspect had stalked her for several days. She added that last Sunday at 6:30pm, an attempt was made to forcefully take her out of the house.
“Today’s incident further escalated when he attempted to forcibly abduct me from my house while I was returning his gifts. This amounts to abduction, harassment, and assault under the law. For evidence, I have CCTV footage,” she was quoted as saying in the FIR.",2025-09-07,Tahir Naseer,705,0.000113

• Visits Guddu and Sukkur barrages, says handling 900,000 to one million cusecs will be extremely challenging
SUKKUR: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Sunday said the provincial government, with the support of the army, navy and Rangers, was fully prepared to deal with what he described as the
looming
“super flood” in the Indus river.
Talking to the media during his visit to the Sukkur and Guddu barrages, the CM said that the provincial government’s foremost priority is to protect human lives and livestock, followed by safeguarding the province’s three major barrages.
“We have devised a comprehensive strategy for a super flood [when inflows are recorded at 900,000 cusecs or more]. First, we will save people and cattle, then ensure the safety of Guddu, Sukkur, and Kotri barrages,” he said.
The chief minister explained that water levels in the Ravi was rising and were being closely monitored, as inflows from Trimmu would reach Sindh in about five days via Panjnad. “By tonight, Trimmu may touch its highest point, which will give us a clear estimate of how much water Sindh will receive,” he said.
The CM said mapping had already been completed to identify vulnerable villages. “We know exactly which areas will be affected at different water levels — 500,000 to 700,000 cusecs, 700,000 to 900,000, or even beyond. If inflows cross 900,000 cusecs, over 200,000 people may be impacted,” he warned.
He noted that Sindh’s terrain poses greater risks than Punjab’s. “In Punjab, designated breaches allow water to return quickly to the river. But Sindh lies below river level, so once water spreads, it does not recede easily,” he explained.
On the embankments, he highlighted six sensitive locations on the Right Bank of the Indus. “KK (Kashmore-Kandhkot) Bund is particularly vulnerable, while on the Left Bank, Shank Bund is structurally weak and may not withstand 800,000 to 900,000 cusecs. Still, our top priority is to protect it,” he stressed.
Recalling past floods, the chief minister said the inflows of 1.1 million cusecs had passed from Guddu Barrage in 2010. “This time, even 900,000 to one million  cusecs would be extremely challenging. On Aug 24, 550,000 cusecs had  already flowed through Guddu, which touched embankments and damaged  crops in some areas. If inflows remain limited, losses will be  manageable, but crops may still not survive,” he observed.
The CM was briefed by Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA)  and Minister Makhdoom Mahboobzaman on flood preparedness at Guddu and  Sukkur barrages, where water flow may cross 900,000 cusecs.
According  to the briefing, 15 districts, 167 UCs and 1,651 villages could be  affected in case of a “super flood”, endangering over 1.63 million  people (273,148 families).
The chief minister told the media that 948 relief camps have been set up, mobile  health units are functional, and the PDMA has established medical camps  with essential medicines, including anti-snakebite vaccines.
“Pakistan  Navy, Army and Rangers are fully coordinating with us. Around 192  rescue boats are already deployed in katcha areas,” he added.
He assured that cooked food would be provided at relief camps and that houses destroyed in riverine areas would later be rebuilt on higher ground.
The CM said all ministers, MPAs and officials had been deployed on flood emergency duties, while security arrangements were being ensured with the help of the Corps Commander and DG Rangers.
He added that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari was in constant contact,  President Asif Ali Zardari had been issuing directions, and provincial party president Nisar Khuhro had mobilised workers.
He was accompanied by provincial ministers Sharjeel Memon, Nasir Shah and Jam Khan Shoro, while Mukesh Chawla joined him at Guddu and Mohammad  Bux Khan Mahar at Qadirpur-Ghotki.
Inspects water flows, embankment conditions
Earlier, the chief minister visited the Guddu and Sukkur barrages to review water flows, embankment conditions, and ongoing rehabilitation projects.
At Guddu Barrage, Minister for Irrigation Jam Khan Shoro and Secretary Irrigation Zareef Khero told the CM that the rehabilitation and modernisation project, launched in 2017, had achieved  72.6 per cent physical and 78.6pc financial progress. The project,  being executed by China’s New Era Development Group, is now expected to be completed by March 2026.
The chief minster directed that the project must be finished within the revised timeline without compromising on quality.
During  his visit to Sukkur Barrage, the chief minister reviewed the Sindh  Barrages Improvement Project (SBIP), funded jointly by the Sindh  government and the World Bank.
The CM was told that work on the project was progressing as planned and is scheduled for completion by June 2027.
CM  Murad termed the rehabilitation of barrages a “historic milestone” for  Sindh’s agriculture and economy, stressing that timely completion would ensure sustainable irrigation, better flood management, and protection of millions of families.
The chief minister also inspected the Kashmore-Kandhkot (KK) Bund to review measures for their protection against the River Indus.
At KK Bund, the secretary irrigation briefed the CM that the river had been attacking the structure since 1995. After the 2010 “super flood”, studs and spurs were installed, with seven new structures completed in 2021 between miles 11  and 18. However, the river is now threatening the downstream side of mile 18. Emergency measures, including stone dumping, stockpiling, and  24/7 monitoring, are in place.
In Qadirpur, Ghotki, CM Murad inspected the Shank Bund, a sensitive structure protecting 5,000 acres of katcha land and the Qadirpur Loop Bund. The bund has remained vulnerable for decades, with a major breach recorded in 2022, when a  thunderstorm widened it to 550 feet. Remote sensing maps prepared on the  CM’s instructions showed 739 acres out of 4,029 acres were flooded.

A statement from the Balochistan Health Department said the blast occurred at a rally of the BNP-M and listed five dead and 29 injured in the incident. It said the injured were brought to the Quetta Civil Hospital for treatment and were provided first aid before being admitted to the trauma centre for further medical attention. Quetta Civil Hospital spokesperson Dr Waseem Baig also confirmed the same toll.
In a media talk at the hospital, Advocate Sajid Tareen, acting president of the BNP-M, said 13 party workers were killed in the blast and several were injured, adding that the attack occurred in the parking lot after a party rally to observe the death anniversary of party founder Attaullah Mengal.
He had earlier posted a picture on X of the crowd gathered for the rally.
Tareen said the party already had apprehensions of such an incident and had contacted the district administration in advance for security. He added that former MPA Ahmed Nawaz and party leader Musa Baloch were among the injured.
A statement from the Balochistan Home Department said rescue teams had reached the scene and the injured were being taken to the hospital for treatment, adding that security forces had cordoned off the area and begun collecting evidence.
It said the government ordered a high-level investigation into the incident and appealed to the public not to heed rumours and to cooperate with institutions.
Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the incident and termed it a “cowardly act of enemies of humanity”.
He said that “malicious elements” were “playing with the blood of innocent citizens”, vowing that the “evil intentions of terrorists” would be thwarted at all costs.
“Instructions have been given to provide the best medical facilities to the injured. Hospital administration and medical staff should remain alert, there should be no negligence in the treatment of the injured,” he said.
Saying that the investigation committee had been ordered to submit its report soon, the chief minister said those involved in the incident would be brought to justice and security agencies had been instructed to immediately apprehend the perpetrators.
“Protection of people’s lives and property is the first responsibility of the government. Malicious elements will not be allowed to succeed in their designs against the peace. The federal and provincial governments will work together to ensure the protection of people’s lives and property.”
Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar reached Civil Hospital on the chief minister’s instructions and was personally overseeing all medical relief activities.
He said that an emergency was imposed in all hospitals after the blast and all doctors and medical staff had been called for duty immediately.
Kakar further said that the regional blood centre was functional and emergency measures were underway to ensure the supply of blood, adding that the best medical facilities were being provided to the injured and operation theatres and ICUs in all hospitals were on alert, along with ambulance services and paramedical staff.
The minister expressed solidarity with the injured and assured all possible support to their families.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the blast.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the blast and extended his condolences to the injured.
“The terrorists and their facilitators of
Fitna-al-Hindustan
are targeting innocent people to create instability through a nefarious conspiracy. With the support of the nation, we will crush the sinister designs of Indian-sponsored terrorists,” he said.
In May, the government
designated
all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as
Fitna al-Hindu­stan
— a
new phrase
aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticised the state over the incident, terming it a case of “incompetence and negligence”.
Opposition coalition Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan strongly condemned the attack and termed it the “worst form of cowardice”.
“We express grief and anger over the martyrdom of political workers. The federal and provincial governments have failed badly in protecting the lives and property of the people.
“The enforcement of the Constitution and law has ended in the country, and every citizen feels insecure. We are assessing the situation and will soon present a detailed stance of the alliance before the public,” the alliance said.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Pakistan (MWM) central chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas Jafri said the incident was not only an attack on a democratic political party and its leadership but also a “direct assault on Pakistan’s constitutional and democratic framework”.
“I strongly demand from the federal and provincial governments and law enforcement agencies that the perpetrators of this attack be immediately arrested and brought to a deterrent end, and that the protection of the lives and property of political leaders and workers across the country be ensured,” he said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945126,COMMENT: Pakistan have a point to prove in Asia Cup final - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"CAN Pakistan do it? Nobody expects them to. India’s captain Suryakumar Yadav, or SKY for short, doesn’t even think that Pakistan deserve being called rivals.
But here they are, the “non-rivals” with a chance to upset India’s pre-scripted march to glory in the Asia Cup. T20 cricket is certainly a game of skill, but it is also a game of chance. And Pakistan, the underdogs, the non-rivals, have a chance.
The first two games in this minor trilogy of contests between the ex-rivals were one-sided and ill-tempered. It isn’t partial to say that India brought the bad vibes. Haris Rauf responded with some low insults and was rightly fined — along with Mr SKY for his comments after the group game.
It’s hard to imagine a final free of needle. That’s probably a good thing for Pakistan, who were more competitive in the Super Fours game as the political row escalated.
India’s cricketing dominance is built on their formidable batting, in particular the brilliance of Abhishek Sharma, the world’s top rated T20 batsman.
Sharma is a purist’s delight as he hits cleanly through the ball, whether playing under his eyes or away from his body. He has taken a liking to Pakistan’s opening bowlers and gave India an unstoppable momentum in the other two games.
Yet the biggest positive for Pakistan over the tournament is the re-emergence of its strike bowlers as a force to be reckoned with. Shaheen Shah Afridi, in particular, has started to remind us of the bowler that he was. Shaheen has a poor record against India, but his confidence should be high, and dismissing Sharma early can change the mental dynamic between the players.
This is added pressure for Shaheen, but it should be welcome for a player who wants to reclaim his status as one of the world’s premier fast bowlers.
There is a lot about Shaheen’s game that is encouraging. He is back to batting with aggression, a style reminiscent of the great all-rounder Wasim Akram.
More importantly, Pakistan need Shaheen to get closer to Wasim’s level as a strike bowler.
Inept top order
The second key area for Pakistan in this final will be the performance of the top order. Other than Sahibzada Farhan, Pakistan’s main hitters have been inconsistent and below par.
The top order lacks quality and is overreliant on the form of its middle and late order. It’s good that Pakistan’s all-rounders have some collective batting form, and that’s enough against lesser teams, but without something major from the top order Pakistan will find it hard to win.
All-round depth is something that Pakistan coach, Mike Hesson, seems to like. It certainly works when Saim Ayub chips in with vital wickets or Mohammad Nawaz scores late runs.
But you can’t build a consistently successful team around the quality of Pakistan’s selected all-rounders.
Pakistan might have lost to India only in this Asia Cup, but they are ranked above the other teams in this tournament. They should be winning those games.
When the World Cup comes around, five more teams ranked higher than Pakistan will also be there. None of those teams will be worried about the quality of Pakistan’s batting.
So, whatever happens today there is some serious work to be done if Pakistan are to be competitive in the T20 World Cup in February.
The extent of our T20 batting failure is confirmed by international rankings where there is no Pakistani player in the top 20. Where might Pakistan get that quality from? The obvious people to reconsider are Babar Azam and Mohammed Rizwan. The next place to look is among the next crop of young batsmen, and it’s a shame that the management didn’t stick with Hasan Nawaz.
Bowling shaping up well
Pakistan’s bowling is developing to be more competitive. There are four wicket takers in Shaheen, Haris, and Abrar Ahmed. Sufiyan Muqeem can’t get a game. Question marks hang over what to do with Faheem Ashraf, Mohammad Nawaz, and Saim Ayub.
Of these, Saim offers the most promise. His wickets are proving vital. A move down the order might work for him in the way that it has done for Mohammad Haris. The other two might make or break their futures today.
The other big question for Pakistan is around the selection of Salman Ali Agha. We don’t even need to get into his captaincy because he does not look like a T20 cricketer at international level.
Agha is a tremendous asset for Pakistan in Test cricket and 50-over cricket, but his T20 journey should end here.
A win in the Asia cup will be a tremendous boost, especially against the odds, but whatever happens today the underlying problems in Pakistan’s T20 formula must not be ignored.
Pakistan’s coach has a record of success with New Zealand and some franchise cricket, but he is still getting to grips with the bamboozling world of Pakistan’s international cricket.
He has a big job to do because the selection is wrong and the batting performances are dismal.
First things first, though, and Pakistan must show Mr Blue SKY and his Indian team what a “non-rivalry” really looks like. Salman’s team have a point to prove — and some pride to restore.

Besides, it also suggested postponing the Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Test (MDCAT) exam in the aftermath of
floods
.
The committee chairman, Senator Amir Waliuddin Chishti, said increase in prices of medicines was a huge issue. While suggesting expediting the process of registering new drugs, Mr Chishti said Health Minister Mustafa Kamal had told that the decision over withdrawal of price deregulation would be taken after a survey.
It is worth mentioning here that the caretaker government, just a day before expiry of its tenure, decided to deregulate prices of drugs due to which pharmaceutical companies were able to increase prices on their own. The minister gave the same statement during the previous meeting of the committee held last month.
Senator Dr Zarqa Suharwardy Taimur also highlighted that medicine prices were continuously rising, making them unaffordable for the common people, particularly in the aftermath of the devastating floods.
Suggests rescheduling of MDCAT in wake of floods
She emphasised the urgent need for measures to ensure access to affordable medicines.
The ministry officials informed the committee that certain medicines were imported, which contributed to their high cost. The committee was further apprised of the alarming prevalence of counterfeit medicines being sold in the market at high prices.
Senator Amir Waliuddin Chishti directed the ministry to submit a detailed report on medicine pricing in the next meeting.
Mustafa Kamal informed the committee members that an online portal had been launched to streamline regulatory procedures regarding import of medical devices. He stated that following its launch, applicants no longer needed to visit Drap office, and 180 cases had already been processed through the portal.
Senator Danesh Kumar raised concerns that nowadays every pregnancy was going through C-section which was not fair with women, adding that doctors were prescribing lots of medicines to patients to get commission and foreign trips.
Senator Irfanul Haque Siddiqui appreciated Senator Danesh Kumar, saying he had raised a very serious issue.
He suggested that details be sought from each doctor as to how many C-section they had done in their services.
The committee chairman recommended submitting data of the federal and provincial hospitals regarding the number of C-sections carried out.
On the request of senators, the committee chairman committee, Senator Amir Waliuddin Chishti, approved setting up of a subcommittee to further probe into the matter.
Senator Fawzia Arshad expressed concern over the rising number of dengue cases in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and stressed the need for immediate preventive measures, including carrying out fumigation to control the spread of the disease.
Suggestion to delay MDCAT
The committee considered the concern raised by Senator Mirza Mohammad Afridi regarding MDCAT examination scheduled for October 6.
Senator Afridi emphasised that due to the devastating floods in several parts of the country, it would be extremely difficult for students from affected and underprivileged areas to appear in the test.
He urged that the examination be delayed till November to provide equal opportunity for all candidates, particularly those belonging to poor and flood-hit families.
The PMDC president informed the committee that a meeting with the test-conducting body was scheduled for today (Wednesday) to review the matter.
He said 138,000 candidates had registered themselves for MDCAT, adding that all aspects would be taken into account and the committee would be apprised of the final decision accordingly.

He said during the initial probe it transpired that they were sitting in the rear seat of the SUV with the vehicle’s engine and air-conditioner on. Ostensibly, fumes or smoke emanating from the exhaust silencer entered the vehicle, and they died of suffocation, he added.
The bodies were shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.
Doctors said there were no signs of torture or strangulation on the bodies. “The cause of death has been reserved and all relevant samples have been collected,” said police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
The police said the woman was a resident of Federal B Area.
They said that the police traced the husband of the deceased woman and handed over the body to the family after completing formalities.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945637/two-state-surrender-pms-endorsement-of-trumps-gaza-plan-draws-strong-reactions-from-political-sphere,‘Two-state surrender’: PM’s endorsement of Trump’s Gaza plan draws strong reactions from political sphere - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"US President Donald Trump, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday unveiled a
20-point plan
for Gaza, seeking to broker a ceasefire, a hostage exchange, demilitarisation, and a transitional governance structure.
The two leaders have warned that Israel would “finish the job” against Hamas if the Palestinian group rejects the deal. Key Muslim nations have
thrown their weight
behind the plan while Washington’s European allies have urged Hamas to accept it.
For its part, Pakistan, which was
personally thanked
by Trump while announcing the deal, has hailed the 20-point plan; Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has welcomed it and called for implementation of the two-state solution.
“I am also convinced that durable peace between the Palestinian people and Israel would be essential in bringing political stability and economic growth to the region,“ he said in a post on X on Sunday night.
The prime minister’s remarks, however, have sparked strong reactions at home, with politicians, analysts, journalists, and activists criticising his endorsement of the Trump plan and terming it a “surrender”.
Author and former diplomat Abdul Basit said: “This is a complete surrender by the Muslim world. They can’t even mention a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.”
He added that it would be a “huge mistake” for Pakistan to join the Abraham Accords before the establishment of the State of Palestine.
As part of the Abraham Accords,
signed during Trump’s first term in office
, four Muslim-majority countries had agreed to normalise diplomatic relations with Israel after US mediation.
He also questioned why the premier was supporting the plan “knowing full well that it is literally ruling out any possibility of creating state of Palestine”.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir termed Trump’s plan a “flawed and unjust proposal that disregards the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people”.
“This secretive plan, crafted without open dialogue, excludes Palestinians and imposes a US-centric solution that prioritises Israeli interests over Palestinian justice,” he said.
He said that the plan sidelined key Palestinian voices, demanded the dissolution of Hamas without addressing its support base and was vague on the issue of Palestinian statehood. It also ignored critical matters such as the status of Jerusalem and Gaza’s humanitarian crisis, he said.
“No solution can succeed without the meaningful participation of the Palestinian people and all stakeholders. A top-down dictate from Washington stands no chance,” he said.
He added that PM Shehbaz’s “hasty endorsement of this plan — betraying both the Palestinian cause and Pakistan’s historic solidarity with it — is surprising”.
“His support for a US-driven framework, without consulting the Pakistani people, who share a deep emotional attachment to the Palestinian cause, or ensuring Palestinian inclusion, undermines that very cause. Only a transparent, inclusive peace process that centres Palestinian voices and delivers true sovereignty can bring peace — not a plan that perpetuates occupation under the guise of peace,” he said.
“There is one issue on which there is complete consensus in Pakistan and that is the issue of Palestine,” said human rights activist Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir.
“This Zionist slave and his masters will never be forgiven by the people of Pakistan for this,” she said.
Author and activist Fatima Bhutto said that her Pakistani passport prohibited her from entering Israel as the country she belonged to had a “duty” to the Palestinian people.
“A Pakistan that forsakes that moral and sacred obligation is an embarrassment and a humiliation,” she said.
She said that the Pakistani people would never accept a “two-state surrender”. “There is only one Palestine and it is occupied by Israel, a criminal genocidal entity,” she said.
“To speak of normalisation during Israel’s live-streamed Holocaust of our Palestinian brothers and sisters is a shattering betrayal. Why does Pakistan exist? It’s a state to protect Muslims. It should do so,” she said.
Journalist Talat Hussain also criticised the plan, saying “The Plan: No Palestinian state; No Palestinian Authority in Gaza; Hamas goes to dustbin of history after releasing all prisoners; Netanyahu becomes the peace maker after killing 64,000 Palestinians; Trump runs Gaza as real estate bonanza in a land soaked in fresh blood.”
In a thread on X, journalist Zarrar Khuhro said: “Standing next to a war criminal, Trump has presented a ‘plan’ that can never really work and which Israel will itself sabotage in no time while blaming Palestinians.”
He noted that the official line had always been a two-state solution, not just from Pakistan, but from a majority of nations.
He said that all the plan would likely be was a way to “whitewash Israel and provide an alternative target for the anger of Palestinians. Should stay away from any such proposals given the ground realities and the nature of genocidal Israel.”
“Whatever the ‘incentives’, the government of Pakistan must not endorse the whitewashing of Israel or join in a security arrangement that amounts to further oppression of Palestinians. This will be absolutely unacceptable to all Pakistanis,” he said.
“In any case, as of yet, there has been no response from Hamas or any other Palestinian group as yet. We know that Israel sets impossible conditions exactly so that they are rejected and they can carry out their agenda of extermination. This new ‘plan’ will likely end the same,” he said.
Activist Ammar Ali Jan reacted to the premier’s post, saying, “Shame on you for talking about ‘peace’ with the Zionist entity at a time when it is committing a genocide of Palestinians.
“The people of Pakistan will never forgive those who join Trump’s plan for normalising these genocidal maniacs. Don’t dare cross this red line,” he said.
Veteran politician Javed Hashmi said that Quaid-i-Azam’s stance was clear that Israel was a “bastard state”.
“Shame on you, your masters, and those puppets whose hands drip with the blood of Palestinians. History won’t forgive you,” he said.
Jamaat-i-Islami central emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that his party categorically rejected the premier’s statement.
“The United Nations Charter is clear: every nation has the right to armed struggle if its land is occupied, and no power can forcibly deny this right. To praise any so-called peace proposal built upon the bodies of 66,000 martyred Palestinians is to stand with the oppressors,” he said.
“Without the will and consent of the Pakistani nation, how can any individual dare to speak in the voice of Donald Trump?” he asked.
Former finance minister Asad Umar said that PM Shehbaz had “overturned a cornerstone of Pakistan policy for decades regarding Palestine, by supporting the Trump plan”.
“He has done this without any national debate and mandate from the nation,” he said, adding that there were seven questions the premier needed to answer.
“The plan says Gaza will be deradicalised and become a terror-free zone. Why does it not say the same about Israel, which is the most radical country in the world and a threat to world peace?” he asked.
“Israeli hostages will be released immediately but Israel will withdraw in an undefined future time in phases. With Israeli history of breaking every peace accord, why is it being trusted and not withdrawing immediately?” he continued.
“How can you support only 600 trucks per day [of] relief goods for a population of more than two million, many on brink of starvation? Even this level agreed in the Jan 2025 accord has not been allowed by Israel,” he pointed out.
He also took issue with the implementation of a technocratic government in Gaza being supervised by the US. “Why lectures of democracy for the rest of the world and an effectively colonised technocracy for Gaza?”
“Hamas will not have any role in Gaza but Netanyahu, who has attacked five sovereign nations in last year and killed more than 66,000 Gazans, including 20,000 children, allowed to continue?” Umar continued.
“When redevelopment is advanced, conditions may be in place for a pathway to Palestinian statehood!!! In other words no two-state solution for decades and probably never. How can you support this treachery?” he questioned.
“Why is there no word about stopping and evacuating the illegal Israeli settlements?”
Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar termed the joint statement issued by Muslim countries a “surrender”.
“Netanyahu goes scot-free after committing genocide!” he said.",2025-09-30,Dawn.com,2153,0.000221

Swabi Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Ijaz Abazai and Saidul Amin, Station House Officer (SHO) at Swabi city police station, told
Dawn.com
that the TikToker was filming videos while dressing as a woman and “striking controversial poses”.
“There was severe resentment and anxiety among society,” SHO Amin said. “Aamir Khan, the in-charge of Bamkhel outpost, traced the TikToker, and police have taken immediate action and arrested the suspect, a resident of Bamkhel.”
A first information report (FIR) has been filed against the TikToker at the Swabi city police station — available with
Dawn.com
— stating that the police came to know that he was making videos performing obscene acts on social media, “which had a very bad impact on society”.
The FIR was registered under Section 294 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which “makes it an offence to commit any obscene act or sing, recite, or utter obscene songs, ballads, or words in or near a public place to the annoyance of others, punishable with imprisonment up to three months, a fine, or both.”
After being arrested, the suspect confessed to the crime and promised to refrain from such immoral activities in the future.
The TikToker said in a video recorded by police: “I belong to Jafarkhail, a Mohallah of Bamkhel village. I was making videos and uploading to my TikTok account. I will not make such videos in the future.”
SHO Amin said that the content creator had been presented in a local court and “would face the law of the land”.
DSP Abazai said that it was very sad that he was making videos in Swabi’s traditional

According to an FIA statement, the action was taken on the instructions of the director of the agency’s Islamabad Zone during a surprise inspection of the immigration staff under the supervision of Deputy Director (Immigration) Salman Liaquat.
The statement read that an assistant sub-inspector and a constable were taken into custody while on duty “after they were found using mobile phones”, which the immigration staff are prohibited from carrying during duty.
Their phones were searched on suspicion, and “important evidence related to illegal immigration” was recovered.
The FIA reported that according to initial investigation, the two men were in “contact with passengers and agents” and “charging Rs50,000 per person to send citizens to the Philippines and Uzbekistan”.
Records of transactions amounting to “millions of rupees were recovered from the suspects’ mobile phones”, and the pair was “using microfinance accounts to receive payments”, the statement read.
A case has been registered with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle in Islamabad, and a three-day physical remand of the suspects has been obtained, it added.
Last month, the FIA took

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945671/govt-raises-petrol-diesel-prices-by-rs4,"Govt raises petrol, diesel prices by Rs4 - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","The federal government on Tuesday increased the price of petrol by Rs4.07 per litre and that of high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs4.04 per litre for the next fortnight.
According to the press release issued by the Finance Division, the petrol price now stands at Rs268.68 per litre from Rs264.61 per litre. Meanwhile, the price of diesel has jumped to Rs276.81 per litre from Rs272.77 per litre.
It added that it decided on these new rates upon the recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the relevant ministries.
Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households. HSD fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods.
The government currently imposes no GST on petroleum products, but char­ges significant levies. These include Rs79.50 per litre on diesel and Rs80.52 per litre on petrol and high-octane products, which also cover Rs2.50 per litre under the CSL.
In addition, customs duties of around Rs16-17 per litre apply to both petrol and diesel, regardless of whether the products are imported or locally produced.
Meanwhile, Ogra on Tuesday also notified a decrease in the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs.6.70 per kilogramme for the month of October. After the reduction, a 11.8kg cylinder of LPG, which cost Rs2,527.47 in September, will now be sold for Rs2,448.33, down by Rs.79.14 or 3.13 per cent.
In a statement, a copy of which is available with

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939306/flour-millers-blame-punjab-ban-for-wheat-crisis,Flour millers blame Punjab ban for  wheat crisis - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: As consumers continue to pay
inflated prices
for various flour types, millers have accused the Punjab government of creating an artificial wheat and flour crisis by imposing a ban under Section 144 on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and related products.
The Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA) South Zone argued that such restrictions contradict the wheat deregularisation policy and violate Article 151 of the Constitution, which allows the free movement of goods across provinces. The association warned that provincial-level curbs inevitably lead to nationwide disruptions.
PFMA South Zone Chairman Abdul Junaid Aziz, in a letter to Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain on Tuesday, said the ban had placed wheat stocks worth billions of rupees at risk in Punjab, especially in the wake of recent floods. The restriction also deprives consumers in other provinces of access to lower-priced flour.
He noted that Punjab accounts for 70pc of the country’s wheat output, making other provinces heavily dependent on its surplus. “We are a single nation. Our joys and sorrows are shared. Such measures damage national unity,” Aziz stated, calling on the federal government to intervene immediately.
He warned that the stored wheat in flood-affected areas could be destroyed if not moved promptly to safer locations in other provinces. “The Punjab government is taking a heavy risk by blocking the movement of wheat, endangering national food security and increasing financial losses to the exchequer,” he said.
Aziz added that Punjab currently holds sufficient surplus wheat stocks and there is no justifiable reason for the movement ban.
Chaudhry Aamir Abdullah, Central Executive Member of PFMA South, proposed that the government either lift the inter-provincial movement restrictions or allow the private sector to import one million tonnes of wheat to avoid an imminent wheat and flour crisis.
He noted that the Punjab government had set up checkpoints at exit routes and motorway interchanges to monitor and block the transport of wheat and flour to other provinces.Millers warned that failure to act swiftly could lead to a severe flour shortage and further price hikes in the coming months.

Addressing a press conference at the Directorate General Public Relations, the provincial minister emphasised that disaster relief should not be politicised.
“The relief cards will ensure that help reaches the right people without making them suffer further. We are focused on serving, not politicising,” she said.
“Should we take advice from those who have turned Sindh into archaeological ruins?” she added, taking a jibe at the Sindh government.
The provincial minister criticised those who she claimed were using the crisis to “advance their political agendas”.
“Our focus is on relief and rehabilitation. Not everything should be turned into politics,” she said. “These relief buses and programmes are for the people, not for headlines.”
The Punjab government has announced a compensation package including Rs20,000 per acre for crop loss, Rs1 million for completely destroyed homes, Rs500,000 for partially damaged homes, and Rs500,000 for the loss of cattle.
“All of these funds are from the Punjab government’s own resources. We haven’t asked anyone for financial aid,” Bokhari emphasised.
“The [Punjab] chief minister and her team are continuously on the ground, working tirelessly in flood-affected areas. You haven’t seen such governance before.”
Despite the disaster, development work in the province has not stalled, the minister claimed. Under the
Apni Chhat, Apna Ghar
housing scheme, 80,000 houses are under construction, with the number expected to reach 100,000 by December, she added.
Bokhari highlighted that several federal leaders, including PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani — both belonging to the ruling party in Sindh — have acknowledged the Punjab government’s efficient handling of the flood situation.

murder case
of teenage TikToker Sana Yousaf on Sept 20.
During Saturday’s hearing, police presented the accused in court. The judge handed over copies of the
challan
to him and announced the date for his formal indictment. The case was registered at Sumbal Police Station.
Earlier, the prime suspect had recorded a confessional statement under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) before a magistrate, admitting to have shot dead the 17-year-old social media influencer.
In his statement, Hayat — son of a retired government official and a TikToker himself — said he had developed a one-sided infatuation with Sana after connecting with her through social media. He confessed that suspicion and jealousy drove him to commit the crime.
Hayat revealed he travelled from Jaranwala to Islamabad on May 28 to wish Sana on her birthday. When she did not meet him, he became convinced she was deliberately avoiding him. On June 2, he returned to the capital after renting a Toyota Fortuner and carrying a 30-bore pistol, intending to confront her.
According to his account, when Sana did not respond to repeated calls, he went to her home in G-13 sector, forced his way inside, and fatally shot her in front of her mother and maternal aunt. He then took Sana’s mobile phone to erase their conversations and fled.
Hayat said he directed the driver to drive fast and later hid the murder weapon near a railway bridge before returning to Jaranwala.
Islamabad Police arrested him within 20 hours of the crime during a raid in Faisalabad, recovering the pistol and Sana’s phone.
Investigators said raids were conducted at more than 11 locations across Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Faisalabad to track him down. His movements were traced using geo-fencing and CCTV footage, particularly his escape route from G-13 to Chungi No 26.
In the court, Hayat expressed remorse for his actions, telling the magistrate He felt deeply ashamed for having taken the life of an innocent teenage girl.
“I feel deeply ashamed for committing such a cruel act,” he reportedly said, adding that his confession was voluntary and not made under pressure.

Commonly known as “brain-eating amoeba”,
Naegleria Fowleri
, is commonly found in warm fresh water —such as lakes, rivers and hot springs — and soil. Only one species, Naegleria fowleri, infects people.
It infects people when water containing the amoeba enters the body through the nose. This typically happens when people go swimming, diving, or when they put their heads under fresh water, like in lakes and rivers. The amoeba then travels up the nose to the brain, where it destroys the brain tissues and causes Primary Amoebic Meni­ngoencephalitis (PAM).
The first symptoms of the PAM usually start about five days after infection and may include headaches, fever, nausea or vomiting. Later symptoms can include a stiff neck, confusion, a lack of attention to people and surroundings, seizures, hallucinations and comas.
After symptoms start, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within five days. The germ cannot survive in cool, clean and chlorinated water.",2025-09-13,Imtiaz Ali,444,9.3e-05

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940107,Unpacking campus scandals - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"NO one denies that outrageous incidents occur within our universities, sometimes making national news.
Examples include professors demanding sexual favours for better grades, male students creating fake, explicit AI images of female students, and administrators or low-level employees using hidden cameras for blackmail. Social media magnifies all this by a thousand, maybe a million. My internet search shows that some salacious on-sale videos can be viewed for only Rs100. Each scandal inevitably triggers public outrage that peaks and then fades.
Rightly speaking, university administrators should swiftly investigate and appropriately punish teachers or students. Unfortunately, this is rare. However, officials cannot always be held responsible because female students are usually too afraid to testify, fearing damage to their reputations even if they had been trapped and were guiltless. In a heavily patriarchal society with skewed power relationships, what can they do?
Media lynching — such as the recent
sting operation
at Bahawalpur University — is therefore seen as an alternative. Carried out by a popular TV channel, its viewership must have skyrocketed. The university’s authorities had, as expected, waffled. But is justice truly served by cameras chasing some bad-guy professor? One can be doubtful.
True injustice occurs, however, when these instances are weaponised by reactionary voices. They rush to seize a megaphone, multiply fears, ignite lurid sexual fantasies and declare the coed university as a den of sin and temptation disallowed by religious and cultural mores. See, they say, let the sexes intermingle and
bay-hayaee
(immorality) is what you get.
Reports of sexual misconduct are weaponised to enforce segregation and oppose coeducation.
The impact of such propaganda in a conservative society can only be imagined. In the aftermath of even a single incident, we cannot ever know how many hundreds of daughters were disallowed by their fathers or brothers from enrolling at some coed campus or being withdrawn from one.
A frequently proposed solution is to have more women-only universities. This is a dead end. I’ve guest lectured at several and to call them universities is a travesty. Perhaps they could be better described as female safe houses or custodial centres where minds must be sheltered and dulled, not challenged and sharpened.
What about going the Taliban way, and banning female education altogether? Even with the explosive growth of Pakistani conservatism, the near parity of male-female enrolment (100-96) in tertiary education suggests that urbanites do not want this extreme. Universities — whose revenues depend on enrolment — tread cautiously.
As a way out, worried officials aim to reassure fathers and brothers (mothers rarely matter) by increasing segregation through strict moral pol­icing. Official circulars are periodically issued that threaten violators with fines, denial of entry on campus, withholding of semester results, or expulsion. But how do they define morality?
Official websites do not list as ‘immoral’ crimes like theft, academic cheating, plagiarism or vandalism. Similarly, harassment and violence against different ethnic and religious groups, or disrupting cultural and music festivals, are not classified as immoral. Depending on who’s in charge, some officials disallow such actions while others secretly or openly endorse them.
Immorality, however, revolves around female attire. While none can deny that clothing should be ‘modest’, its meaning varies from city to city and campus to campus. Back in the early 1970s, when I started my university teaching career, the number of female students at Quaid-e-Azam University in burqa were fewer than the fingers on one hand. Today they are the majority, followed by the less restrictive hijab, while those without head cover are outliers.
Morality also comes under threat when a female walks by herself (hence becomes vulnerable), engages in casual conversations with male students, or makes friends across the divide. This is less emphasised at institutions like Lums whose official policy merely forbids PDA (public display of affection) such as the holding of hands. But within that same city is Punjab University (PU), a once-decent relic from British times.
Now better known for hyperactive moral squads than for scholarly accomplishments, PU is the headquarters of the
Islami Jamiat-i-Talaba
. IJT denounces coeducation and has physically attacked couples found sitting together on the university’s lawn or benches. Some teachers and officials make no secret of their support for such actions.
Modernity is impacting every country’s values and eliciting different responses. Turkiye, Morocco and Bangladesh have liberal campuses, much more so than ours. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are now outpacing even them. Whether or not de-segregation has full popular support, this is what their autocratic rulers have decided. On the other hand, even under Iran’s strict clerical rule, the cruel death in custody of 22-year-old anti-hijab activist
Mahsa Amini
led to countrywide
protests
, suggesting that change is inevitable.
Modernity is also changing Pakistan but far slower than elsewhere. Our conservatives still don’t want wives and daughters to work, but their opposition has diminished now that females in one out of five families have outside jobs. Despite all efforts to minimise contact between genders, full segregation is proving impossible.
The Pakistani diaspora in Britain, now into its third generation, remains backward and stuck in a quandary. Many parents, fearing corruption, resist sending their children to British coed schools. This makes for awkwardness in a society that treasures equality of men and women. Even more seriously, this puts many Pak-Brits at the bottom of the social heap for lack of skills and knowledge. Attitudes towards females, derived from enforcing school segregation, can show up late in life.
Islamophobic forces in Britain have long derived strength from grooming gang sex scandals that, much more than other immigrants, implicate British-Pakistani men. While the far right’s claims are exaggerated to suit its political agenda, Pakistanis familiar with male attitudes towards females in general, and white girls in particular, say: where there’s smoke there’s fire.
Gender-related crimes on campus — or elsewhere for that matter — have no easy solution. Would restricting women to female-only workplaces restore purity and virtuousness? Would banning all contact between males and females eliminate sexual misconduct on our coed campuses?
Very likely, this would — just as banning all cars and motorbikes would eliminate traffic accidents. However, travelling on horses and camels is not a price that many, including conservatives, are willing to pay.

The development comes days after a poliovirus case was
confirmed
in Sindh’s Hyderabad district.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio
remains endemic
. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
The statement issued by the NIH today said: “With these two cases, both girls, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 29, including 18 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, nine from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.”
The NIH handout stated that this month, a sub-national polio vaccination campaign was conducted across 88 districts of the country, including Badin and Thatta. “The campaign successfully reached nearly 21 million children under the age of five,” it said.
It added that the next nationwide polio vaccination campaign would be held from October 13 to 19, aiming to protect around 45.4 million children under the age of five.
“During the campaign, Vitamin A will also be administered alongside the oral polio vaccine (OPV) to boost children’s immunity levels. More than 400,000 dedicated frontline workers will go door-to-door to ensure that every eligible child receives this essential protection,” the NIH said.
The institute said that these campaigns were aimed at “rapidly boosting children’s immunity and strengthening protection as part of Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to eradicate polio”, encouraging parents and caregivers to ensure their children were vaccinated.
“Polio eradication is a shared responsibility. While dedicated frontline polio workers deliver vaccines, parents and caregivers must ensure their children receive all recommended doses, including routine immunisations,” it said.
In 2024, the country
reported
at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.",2025-09-29,Rukhsana Khan,606,0.000105

LAHORE: Evacuation eff­orts continued across central and south Punjab as exceptionally
high flood levels
persist between the Panjnad confluence of Chenab-Ravi-Sutlej and Guddu Barrage in Sindh, creating a severe humanitarian crisis, inundating low-lying areas, displacing large populations, and destroying hundreds of acres of standing crops.
The overflowing Indus has also inundated parts of Sindh, with areas in Dadu and Lar­kana witnessing widespread displacement in riverine areas.
Residents of flood-hit areas are also facing widespread electricity and mobile service outages, leaving them cut off from authorities and relatives, while trapped by rising waters.
Punjab Relief Commi­ssioner Nabil Javaid said 97 people had lost their lives as Punjab faced the “biggest flood in history”. He reported that 2.45 million people from 4,500 villages along the Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab rivers had been affected, and that 1.9m cattle had been moved to safe locations.
The Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) has warned of a very high flood at Head Panjnad, Sidhnai, and Ganda Singh Wala, while high flood levels persist at Head Sulemanki, Head Islam, and Mailsi Syphon.
According to FFD data, released at 1am on Saturday, Punjnad Headworks recorded a flow of 651,572 cusecs, while the outflows at Guddu Barrage were steady at 537,392 cusecs.
Breaches
A total of 19 controlled breaches were carried out on Friday to mitigate the flood threat to Jalapur, Alipur, while efforts to repair the damaged dyke in Shujabad continued in earnest.
In Shujabad, a dyke collapsed at Mouza Dhundwala, flooding several villages and sending water towards the city. The administration and irrigation officials are trying to reinforce the Bakhto Wah canal dyke to protect the town, but several villages have already been submerged.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, who toured several flood hit areas on Friday, also visited the breach site and directed officials to seal it.
However, three workers sent to repair the breach in Shujabad were swept away by the rising waters. Two of them were rescued, but their third colleague could not be traced and was feared dead.
Authorities also made controlled breaches on Uch Sharif Road to divert floodwaters away from Jalalpur city, with Multan police chief Sadiq Ali Dogar saying the decision was necessary as pressure on temporary dams was not easing.
In Alipur, the administration breached Seetpur Road at 18 locations to disperse water flowing towards the city, submerging several villages and trapping thousands on rooftops.  Here, a rescue boat capsized in Darabpur village when a man tried to climb on it, causing it to lose balance. However, all passengers were rescued.
‘Calamity-hit’ Alipur
Marriyum Aurangzeb also visited Alipur to monitor flood relief operations. She declared Alipur tehsil a calamity-hit area.
People gathered around her to report that six members of a family were missing after a rescue boat capsized in Seetpur. Many residents were stranded on rooftops, and boats were not available for evacuation.
The government also deployed drones in the flood-affected areas of Seetpur city to distribute food items. The drones carried supplies and delivered them to people stranded on rooftops.
Malik Riaz, a resident of Seetpur, told Dawn that he had been without food and water for the last two days and that the drone delivery provided much-needed relief. He added that hand pumps were emitting dirty water, which was unsafe for drinking.
Rescue spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said that 18,130 people have been rescued from Jalalpur Pirwala, 11,700 from Liaqatpur in Rahim Yar Khan, and 6,400 from Alipur. In the last 24 hours across Punjab, 19,946 people were rescued from flood-affected areas, including 1,955 from Bahawalpur, 1,715 from Pakpattan, 1,407 from Lodhran, 830 from Okara, 823 from Bahawalnagar, 659 from Jhang, 585 from Kasur, 558 from Vehari, and 545 from Toba Tek Singh.
Dadu flooding
In Sindh, floods inundated parts of Dadu as the Indus River overflowed near the Dadu-Moro Bridge, submerging more than 30 villages in the riverine areas. The rising waters have displaced large numbers of residents and triggered outbreaks of waterborne and other infectious diseases.
The Health Department, People’s Primary Healthcare Initiative and Rescue 1122 have set up medical camps to provide urgent care.
According to Deputy Commissioner Syed Murtaza Ali Shah, medical camps have been established along the protective embankment, while mobile ambulances are operating to assist the affected population. Boats have also been deployed to help stranded residents. Authorities are monitoring the situation closely and have urged the residents to cooperate with rescue teams and follow precautionary measures.
PM praises relief efforts
Separately, PM Shehbaz Sharif on Friday praised all four chief ministers, as well as the governments of GB and AJK, for carrying out prompt and effective flood relief operations across the country.
The prime minister specially commended his niece, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, saying: “She is leading from the front.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943591/a-reunion-with-limits,A reunion with limits - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"PAKISTAN and Saudi Arabia have recently restored their once-close relationship, signing a landmark
agreement
to expand defence cooperation.
This reunion comes after more than half a decade of both countries exploring alternative strategic alignments, only to return to their traditional partnership. The new defence pact, carrying significant strategic and geopolitical importance, has reignited debates across the Middle East and South Asia, where it is being interpreted through multiple lenses and perspectives.
The strains in Pakistan-Saudi relations had deepened when Islamabad chose to align with a new bloc led by Iran, Turkiye and Malaysia, an initiative that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman took as a serious affront. Personal tensions between former prime minister Imran Khan and MBS, often whispered about in policy circles at that time, further complicated matters. But the cracks had appeared earlier, when Pakistan refused to dispatch troops to Yemen, despite the red-carpet welcome prime minister Nawaz Sharif had received from King Salman bin Abdulaziz. The crown prince’s ambition to build an ‘Islamic Nato’ also faltered, pushing Riyadh to explore other strategic options, including strengthening ties with India and relying more heavily on the US for defence.
In this context, Saudi Arabia, along with the UAE, envisioned, with the US, an ‘India-Middle East Economic Corridor’ in 2023, conceived as a counterweight to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Pakistan, tied deeply to the BRI through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, found itself excluded from this alternative connectivity project.
During this period of strain, both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia tested the limits of their influence. Pakistan’s establishment pursued ‘patron shopping’, seeking new alliances and sources of support, while Saudi Arabia recalibrated its neighbourhood policy, mending ties with Iran, reimagining its partnership with Turkiye, and reshaping its strategic engagement with Russia.
At the same time, Pakistan sought to create inroads into Central Asia and the Baltic region, with a particular focus on Azerbaijan, while further strengthening its ties with Turkiye to fill the geopolitical void left by its estranged relationship with Saudi Arabia.
In short, over the past seven years, both nations have gone through bitter as well as sweet experiences, and there is hope that the foundation of their renewed relationship will prove as solid as before. One advantage for Pakistan this time is that the ‘Iran factor’ is less likely to strain ties, as it did in the past.
Saudi Arabia and Iran have already developed a functional state-to-state relationship. Tellingly, even as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed their new defence cooperation agreement, Iran’s foreign minister was in Riyadh on a follow-up visit to President Masoud Pezeshkian’s April trip to maintain the momentum of their relationship, which Tehran needs most in the volatile Middle East situation. During that visit, Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, met with both MBS and Defence Minister Khalid bin Salman, signalling a broader regional détente.
The future of renewed Pak-Saudi ties lies in standing together during difficult times.
Although the recent pact is not the first defence-related agreement between the two nations, one clause has drawn particular attention: “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”. For Pakistan analysts, the significance of this commitment, modelled on Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, lies in the Indian context, while many Saudi and Middle Eastern experts view it through the prism of Yemen and potential aggression from Israel.
As for Saudi-India relations, their trajectory is unlikely to change dramatically. Over the past two decades, both countries have invested heavily in economic, strategic, and political ties that cannot easily be reversed. Under Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia seeks to diversify its economy, reduce dependence on oil and attract foreign investment in areas where India is considered a vital partner. If conflict were to erupt between India and Pakistan, the most Riyadh would realistically do is attempt to mediate, as it did during the
stand-off
of May 2020.
A crucial lesson Saudi Arabia has drawn in recent years is that its relationship with Pakistan cannot be reduced to transactional security concerns or proxy wars. Despite past strains, the partnership remains broader and more profound. The future of this renewed relationship lies in standing together during difficult times, expanding military training and joint defence production, and building capabilities that not only strengthen both sides but also send a clear message to any potential aggressor: the Pakistan-Saudi friendship is not to be breached.
The optimism that followed the agreement — that it might pave the way for an Islamic bloc — is little more than an illusion. The rulers of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states lack both the vision and the desire to pursue such a project, having long felt that sentimentality has yielded little in the past and is unlikely to pay off in the future.
The idea of an Islamic alliance is, in fact, more of a Tehran aspiration, born out of Iran’s relative isolation in the Muslim world and its need to project moral and ideological leadership. Beyond Iran, these utopian notions are sustained mainly by radicals, both violent and non-violent, within Muslim societies, as well as by ideologues who occasionally compel rulers to adopt such rhetoric, as has often happened in Pakistan. In reality, the idea remains impractical, especially when multiple Muslim nations continue to vie for leadership of the ummah.
The revived Pakistan-Saudi relationship, however, will bring tangible economic and financial benefits to Pakistan. Yet, one critical lesson for Pakistan’s power elites is that the country’s persistent economic fragility has itself strained ties with Riyadh. Time and again, Pakistani leaders have looked towards Saudi Arabia in moments of crisis, reducing the relationship to a lifeline for financial bailouts. True national strength does not lie in defence capabilities alone; it depends on internal cohesion and sustained economic growth.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1938853/infected-inmates,Infected inmates - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"WHEN one thinks of Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, one thinks of
overcrowding
and misery. Unbeknownst to many, the facility also has the dubious honour of holding the
highest number
of HIV-positive inmates in Punjab, as revealed recently by the Punjab Aids Control Programme.
Figures show 148 prisoners are infected in the detention centre, built for fewer than 2,000, but crammed with over 4,300. The outbreak not only highlights the dangers of neglecting healthcare in closed institutions, it also reminds us of our
failed response
to HIV.
Overcrowded prisons are the perfect incubators for disease, especially given the inadequate attention to health and risky inmate behaviour. The dangers in Pakistan are amplified by a history of unsafe practices — unsterile injections, lax blood-banking and rampant syringe sharing. Ratodero in 2019, where hundreds of children
contracted
HIV from a single doctor’s
reused syringes
, was the most notorious case. Unprotected sex among high-risk groups and migrant workers bringing infections home are two more contributing factors.
The statistics speak for themselves: nearly 40pc of those who inject drugs are HIV-positive, and almost three-quarters admit to reusing syringes. The kind of behaviours that drive transmission in communities find their way into jails. Although prevalence in the general population remains officially low at 0.1pc, UNAIDS modelling suggests that over 230,000 Pakistanis were living with the virus in 2022 — a three-and-a-half-fold increase since 2010.
Pakistan’s response to the virus has been weak. Recent commentary in The Lancet
accused
the state of outsourcing much of the HIV effort to NGOs sustained by foreign donors, leaving the government with little incentive to take ownership. Services remain siloed in stand-alone clinics that are easy to spot; with their bold signage, patients are inclined to avoid stepping in for fear of stigma. Only a third of those infected are on antiretroviral therapy. Spending on prevention has fallen, while international funding, on which Pakistan is dependent, is shrinking. The Global Fund, citing both belt-tightening and mismanagement, has slashed its support by $27m.
As with other health challenges, Pakistan has strategies on paper. Its latest AIDS plan aspires to slash new infections by nearly two-thirds by 2026. Yet provincial health departments often fail to spend the money already allocated, while screening and treatment targets remain a fantasy. In some provinces, less than a quarter of those infected even know their status. Also, while improving prison health is imperative, the government must realise it is not just about inmate welfare. Untreated infections spill back into communities when prisoners are released. The authorities must invest in prison healthcare, enforce safe medical practices, and above all, integrate HIV prevention and treatment into the wider health system. The virus is relentless and so must the country’s response be.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1938996/kp-govt-promises-dignified-return-of-afghans,KP govt promises dignified return of Afghans - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"KHYBER: Adviser to the chief minister on health Ihtesham Ali on Monday announced the provision of sufficient quantities of medicines for the returning Afghan nationals along with nutritional food for their children.
During a visit to the “temporary withholding camp” in Landi Kotal here, he said that every effort would be made to send Afghans home in a dignified manner while fulfilling all legal requirements.
He said staff members at the withholding camp were strictly asked to fulfil all health-related and other requirements of the returning Afghans while caring for their self-respect, as people of both countries shared norms and values.
Officials told the adviser to the CM that on average, around 3,000 families were returning to their country on a daily basis.
He met with Afghans and asked them about the facilities offered at the camp.
In Lower South Waziristan district, around 650 Afghan individuals returned to their homeland via the Angoor Adda border crossing in the last two days, said deputy commissioner Musarrat Zaman here on Monday.
The statement came as the phased repatriation of Afghan refugees under the supervision of the district administration continued in the day.
The DC said that the returnees included men, women and children, who crossed the border in an orderly manner under the guidance of staff deployed at the gate.
He said the entire process was being conducted peacefully in line with regulations and in coordination with security forces.
The official said a temporary shelter established at the Angoor Adda border point had been made functional with a capacity of 50 beds, while drinking water, electricity and food were provided to families awaiting their return to Afghanistan.
Also, the district administration has set up a tent village at the Agri Park Wana to temporarily accommodate Afghan families.
Meanwhile, Haripur’s deputy commissioner Waseem Ahmad on Monday said that the district administration was making all-out efforts to facilitate hassle-free voluntary repatriation of Afghan refugees to their country.
“We have assured them [returnees] that their cultural norms would be respected, while their journey to Torkham border would be made hassle-free and respectful,” he told reporters on Monday.
The DC said that he asked Afghans to vacate the camps and private houses without delay and the district administration would utilise available resources to make their repatriation easy and dignified.
He said that on a complaint about overcharging by transporters, a committee headed by the additional deputy commissioner (general) and comprising officials of motor vehicle examiner, traffic personnel and officials of Afghan directorate had been constituted to ensure that the repatriating families are not fleeced by truckers.
The DC said he hoped that the refugees would vacate the camps, private houses and businesses without delay.
About the investment of Afghan refugees in different businesses as well as the renting of shops and plazas in Haripur, the DC said that both sides were aware of the government’s decision of not extending the stay of Afghans, so “whatever they did was at their own risk.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942800/balochistan-pac-decries-federal-funding-shortfall,Balochistan PAC decries federal funding shortfall - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"QUETTA: The
Public Accounts Committee
(PAC) of the Balochistan Assembly has disclosed that the federal government shorted the province by over 11 billion rupees from its share of the national divisible pool during the 2022 financial year, calling it a constitutional and 7th NFC award violation.
The PAC, in a meeting on Wednesday presided over by Chairman Asghar Ali Tareen, expressed “serious concern” over the failure to pay Balochistan’s full share and termed it a “gross violation of the constitution”.
The committee formally asked the provincial government to take up the matter of the short payment with the federal government in Islamabad “and do not compromise on it”.
During the meeting, which reviewed financial matters of the provincial Industries and Commerce Department, the PAC strongly objected to the absence of the finance secretary.
Calls it a constitutional violation; demands finance secy’s presence
The committee called his absence on such a critical issue “unacceptable” and summoned him to appear today to explain when a financial reconciliation would be completed. It also directed the Auditor General’s office to verify the recovery of the outstanding amount.
In a separate finding, the committee noted a discrepancy of 6.99bn rupees between district accounts offices and the National Bank, calling it a “serious irregularity” that undermines financial discipline.
While reviewing the Industries Department’s accounts, the PAC was told the department had a grant of 2.53bn rupees for the 2021-22 fiscal year. Of that amount, 196 million rupees remained unused but were not surrendered.
Auditors also found that 62.5m rupees in ground rent had not been recovered from allottees, despite repeated reminders, and that 5.1m rupees were paid to contractors through inflated rates and for unauthorised works.
Mr Tareen expressed anger over the excess payments, terming them “against the rules” and ordering their immediate recovery.
He directed all departments to convene Departmental Accounts Committee meetings on time to resolve such irregularities, warning that the PAC would otherwise be “compelled to take strict decisions”.
‘Fiscal autonomy’
Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti Balochistan asserted on Wednesday that the province must significantly boost its own financial resources to achieve “genuine fiscal autonomy” and spur development.
Presiding over a meeting of the Balochistan Revenue Authority (BRA) Advisory Council, Mr Bugti said that reducing dependence on the federal government, preventing tax evasion and increasing provincial revenues are key priorities.
“Balochistan’s development could only be achieved by reducing dependence on the federation and enhancing its own sources of income to establish true financial self-reliance,” Mr Bugti stated.
During the meeting, the council decided to expand the scope of the tax on services, bringing more sectors into the tax net.
Mr Bugti added that provincial taxes, including sales tax on services, contract services, franchise fees, telecommunications, insurance, and construction, would be made more transparent and simplified.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942187/the-words-of-the-chief-justice,The words of the Chief Justice - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"In 1817, Chief Justice John Marshall, one of America’s founding fathers, delivered what is often called the
shortest judgment
in judicial history: “The United States never pays costs.” This was the entirety of a unanimous majority decision in the Supreme Court case of
United States v. Barker
. Six words settled a complex question of law that had gone unanswered for twenty years, and solidified jurisprudence on sovereign immunity with clarity and precision.
Exactly 208 years later, the unthinkable happened. In a judgment authored by Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) ruled on the case of a journalist restricted from leaving the country with the following: “Office objection is sustained”. Move over Justice Marshall, that looks like four words and a newly broken world record to me.
Pakistan: 1, USA: 0.
A stunning upset like this must be exactly the kind of judicial achievement the framers of the
26th Amendment
dreamed of. So where are the balloons, the mass media coverage, the celebrations on the streets? Why is it only this writer who’s publicly noticed an achievement so grand?
Well, it might have something to do with the difference between these two judgments. Brevity is the soul of wit, and that Shakespearean adage applies to both. But while the former sought to push the limits of how much you could accomplish with how few words, the latter took a different approach, by not seeking to accomplish anything at all.
When courts shield power, not people
For context, the journalist, Asad Ali Toor, had approached the court after he was stopped at an airport and
prevented from leaving the country
to attend a training program.  He had been placed on the “Provisional National Identification List”, which exists under a 2018 standing order for the purposes of preventing fugitives of ‘heinous crimes’, like rape, murder, or terrorism, from fleeing abroad.
The only ‘heinous’ crime Toor has ever been accused of is irritating some very powerful people. Regardless, his name was on the list; he was not told this fact until he was packed up and ready to board his flight, and someone in a very high office likely took great pleasure in the deliberate act of causing him pain.
Courts exist for the precise purpose of shielding regular citizens from thuggery like this. What happened to Toor was illegal in at least a dozen different ways: he was not even accused of anything that merited inclusion in the PNIL; no reasoning or show-cause notice was given; the Courts have consistently held that one must be informed when placed on such a list; an accused must be given the right to appeal; the Constitution guarantees freedom of movement; and the list goes on and on. Toor has a
history of being targeted and punished
for his journalism (even the people who sold him his parrots
were not spared
), and this cannot be ignored when judging his present mistreatment.
For a case like this to land before a judge is a ripe and easy opportunity to affirm that justice is not dead in this country — that some loose cog in our very large government machinery cannot arbitrarily decide that it does not like you, and therefore you must deal with a certain amount of misery as a prerequisite to your existence here. Confronted with a situation so transparently unjust, a judge has the chance to deliver a comprehensive verdict that strengthens individual liberties and at least attempts to ensure that no citizen of this country ever goes through such an indignity again.
Justice Babar Sattar of this same court did just that in his excellent judgment on illegal phone tapping. If the chief justice so desired, he could have affirmed and strengthened the constitutional right to free movement in a way that made Pakistan a better place, with a stronger rule of law, for all of us.
Instead, we got the world’s shortest judgment. Toor had been told by the registrar’s office that, before he comes to court, he must first go to the government department that is visibly intent on making his life miserable. The office objection was sustained. The training program went on without him. Now, it could happen to you, too. Whether you love him or hate him, agree with his opinions or not, or even know who he is, Toor has unravelled the extent of all our freedoms, and their lack thereof. For now, they’re worth a grand total of four words.
Later, though, we got more words from the chief justice.
Misogyny, misconduct and the language of the law
In another case about the freedom to leave the country, he castigated Imaan Mazari, the same lawyer who represented Toor, for critiquing his work. In open court, the chief justice reportedly threatened contempt proceedings,
said
“shut your mouth”, and then turned to another lawyer, who happened to be Mazari’s husband, to say “control her, one day if I catch her…”. There was no question that these remarks were sexist, threatening, and unacceptable. An apology was due.
Instead, the following day, according to journalists in the courtroom, the chief justice stated: “Imaan Mazari is like my daughter. Yesterday, as a chief justice and as an elder, I was explaining things to her. My remarks were taken out of context”. Specifically, he denied having said he was going to “catch her” and stated (in contradiction of multiple journalists’ reports) that he had, in fact, only asked her husband to catch her (as if that was any better).
There’s an old saying that goes, ‘when you’re in a hole, stop digging’. But the Chief Justice still wasn’t done. “If I initiate contempt proceedings, the girl’s career will be ruined. I explained to her like my children, but she wasn’t understanding”. A shockingly inappropriate word was used to refer to a professional and accomplished lawyer — “
bachi
”. In doubling down on a worldview that sees women as lesser beings, devoid of agency and subject to the restraint, control, and unsolicited advice of the men around them, the chief justice revealed much. But he was clear during his castigation that one should critique the decisions, and not the person, so that is all I’ll do.
The Islamabad High Court Chief Justice’s decision to engage in textbook misogyny and belittle a female advocate for daring to stand up to him does not have much to commend itself. His decision to present a non-apology and further condescension disguised as benevolence only worsened his position. And his decision to still not provide an unconditional apology to all the women who appear in his court, despite multiple condemnations from bar associations and women’s groups, takes this matter to unacceptable levels of misconduct.
Apparently, there is a history to this behaviour. In an
interview
with Matiullah Jan, Mazari’s husband reported that Justice Dogar had been protested by the bar in Multan and ultimately transferred for referring to a lawyer as
‘ulloo ka patha’
in court. The Supreme Judicial Council is the sole body empowered to hold judges accountable for actions like this. At the very least, it should convene to take notice and release the minutes of the meeting to the public to let the country know that the entirety of its justice system does not condone misogyny.
How one clause changed it all
It cannot be ignored that everything you have read about here is a
direct result of the 26th Amendment
. That is what allowed this chief justice to be transferred from number 15 in seniority at the Lahore High Court (LHC) to number one in Islamabad, leapfrogging over some of our country’s most brilliant jurists. No reasoning was ever given to the public as to why Justice Dogar was deemed a better fit than those he superseded for the top job at the court of this nation’s capital.
Five sitting judges went on the record to argue (very convincingly) that this transfer was illegal and amounted to nothing more than an attack on the independence of the judiciary; going so far as to file a petition against the transfer appointments in the Supreme Court (SC). This challenge was heard by the constitutional bench, itself a creation of the 26th Amendment, and went exactly how you would expect it to.
With every passing day, the mess that this amendment created gets layers added to it, and the prospect of any meaningful pushback feels less and less likely. Robust challenges to its legality remain completely ignored by the SC. And almost a year into its enactment, while its impacts are immense and impossible to quantify, the result here is simple; the same IHC that once represented the very best of our judiciary — pushing back against power, delivering intelligent and progressive judgments, and standing up for the vulnerable — has been reduced to castigating activists and broadcasting misogyny.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1941150/lahores-female-bikers-push-for-space-on-the-road,Lahore’s female bikers push for space on the road - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: Women on motorcycles are becoming an increasingly common sight in Pakistan’s major cities.
From university students navigating traffic to working women managing school runs, two-wheelers have become a practical and affordable solution to unreliable public transport.
Yet, despite this growing presence, female riders continue to face significant hurdles, limited infrastructure, patchy support and the challenges of navigating a male-dominated road culture.
In Lahore, female motorcyclists regularly weave through the traffic in residential neighborhoods and around university campuses. Often in traditional shalwar kameez and carrying backpacks, they ride alongside men. This surge is a response to a powerful trifecta of forces: economic pressure, the need for safety and a push toward personal independence.
The rise in female riders is primarily driven by necessity.
Sidra Farooq, a university student, explains, “A rickshaw to my office costs Rs500 a day. Petrol on my bike costs less than Rs200.”
Economy, need for safety, personal independence behind the change
Given that motorcycles make up 74pc of all registered vehicles in Pakistan, their affordability makes them a natural choice for women juggling work, study, and family responsibilities. While affordability is key, safety and autonomy are equally powerful motivators.
Harassment on public transport has long restricted women’s mobility in Pakistan. A UN Women Safety Audit in Public Places in Lahore found that 90pc of women have faced harassment while commuting, including 82pc at bus stops. Such challenges partly explain why Pakistan’s female labour force participation rate remains just 24.26pc, among the lowest globally, the World Bank’s 2024 report shows.
Beyond cost and safety, motorcycles have emerged as empowering tools, offering privacy, control and greater access to work, education, and social spaces.
“It makes me feel independent. Whenever and wherever I want, I can go without troubling my brother or father or booking a ride daily,” says Hiba Afzal, a student at UMT, Lahore. This shift is evident not just on the streets but also in electric vehicle (EV) sales and policy initiatives.
Muhammad Saeed Akhtar, vice president of sales at an EV company in Pakistan, says the shift reflects trends across the wider electric vehicle market.
“Seventy percent of EV buyers are now women nationwide,” he says, noting that sales across the EV industry have surged by 30pc in the last six months.
Compared to the previous year, total EV bike sales in Pakistan have more than doubled, from around 20,000 units to between 43,000 and 45,000, with Lahore driving sales.
This growth coincides with Pakistan’s EV Policy 2025, which reserves 25pc of e-bike subsidies specifically for women, a clear institutional effort to boost female mobility.
Visibility campaigns and training programs have reinforced this confidence, helping normalise women’s presence on the roads.
The Punjab government’s Strategic Reforms Unit (SRU) launched Women on Wheels (WoW), one of the earliest formal initiatives to empower women through riding lessons and subsidised bikes. Between 2016 and 2019, over 5,000 women were trained before the programme was discontinued. Its founder, Salman Sufi, later carried forward the mission through his non-profit.
Today, WoW’s legacy is evident in parts of Lahore, where women ride motorcycles and scooters and riders note a gradual shift in public attitudes.
Anum Shehzadi, a bank employee who began riding bike in 2020, recalls, “When I started, drivers would slow down their vehicles just to stare. Now, reactions are more respectful.”
This gradual acceptance has encouraged women to explore new avenues for mobility, including digital ride-hailing platforms, where they are not only passengers but increasingly drivers themselves. Such participation signals a rising visibility of women on the city’s roads. While this represents an important shift, sustained support is needed to expand female driver programmes and corporate initiatives.
Notwithstanding these gains, many women still face barriers. Family pressure often forces the riders to abandon biking, while unsafe conditions add further risk.
“Women innovate their own solutions, like modifying abayas (robe) to avoid wheel entanglement, but they still struggle to find protective gear and reliable support. Proper training on traffic rules, bike maintenance, and safe riding, along with stricter enforcement of safety laws, would significantly boost their confidence,” says one Fariha Zulfiqar.
Past mobility initiatives, though promising, have struggled without long-term government backing. Despite Rs90m subsidy allocation, only 700 subsidised bikes were distributed under WoW. The programme was eventually phased out in 2019 after a change in the government.
While some women push through challenges, progress often remains individual rather than systemic. Even trailblazers like Faryal Ashraf, Pakistan’s first aspiring female road racer, face exclusion from all-male clubs and races.
“Some people still believe riding and racing are only for men,” she says. “People often stare, and acceptance is still limited in some spaces.” For Ashraf, the challenge extends beyond riding to transforming societal perceptions.
“Riding and racing aren’t just for men—they’re for anyone with skill, dedication, and courage. I want to see professional training facilities and legal racing events where riders, especially women, can develop their riding skill safely and professionally. Every time I ride, I’m breaking barriers not just for myself but for other women too,” she adds.
Lasting change, however, cannot rest on personal determination alone. It requires coordinated action from city authorities, transport agencies, and the private sector.
With strict enforcement of protective laws, inclusive infrastructure, and a culture that accepts women as a normal, respected part of traffic, riding becomes safe and empowering. Training programmes and accessible facilities help, but true progress comes when women on motorcycles are no longer exceptions, but a natural part of Lahore’s everyday rhythm, confidently claiming their place alongside men.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944070/elite-pact,Elite pact - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"THERE is a new defence pact in town — or, shall one say, the region.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have signed a defence
agreement
with pomp and celebration and the announcement has caused much noise and buzz at home and abroad (in some places). Commentary, analyses, songs and discussions, applause — it is all there.
And while the discussion is far from over and one can find much praise and a little bit of criticism from the cheerleaders and doubting Thomases, there is a consensus that very little information is available at the moment. Serious and insightful comment, it seems, will have to wait.
Indeed, more details will need to be filled in and a fuller picture made available before a comprehensive analysis can be undertaken. No wonder then that at the moment, there are more questions than answers and more conjecture than information — questions about what this pact will mean operationally; what the two countries will commit to each other; whether or not this pact has been signed with a specific state in mind or not; and whether it will be expanded to include more countries or followed by more bilateral accords.
But even in the absence of answers, the euphoria in Pakistan is instructive. There is hope, conjecture and even belief that this pact will bring ‘good’ times for the country. And these hopes do not necessarily emanate from officialdom but are also being discussed privately.
Partly, this is understandable because Saudi Arabia has always come to Pakistan’s rescue in the past — with oil on deferred payments as well as loans that help with our forever crisis, ie, low foreign reserves. Even now, the country is one of the biggest contributors to our reserves, with a loan that will be rolled over (and over) whenever the moment arrives.
Domestically, the Pak-Saudi pact is being viewed exactly the same way as some past moments.
So now that there is a formal agreement in place for a bilateral defence pact, in which each promises to come to the aid of the one that is under attack, the conclusions everyone is jumping to are quick. Obviously, Pakistan will provide the muscle power in this relationship, with its well-known military prowess, and obviously, Riyadh will provide some financial concessions or assistance to Islamabad. The good times, they are a comin’.
But these assumptions reveal the elite consensus, shaped over decades, which continues to be in place. A consensus in which the elite want to use external funds to run the economy, wittingly or unwittingly accepting the primary role of the military in not just ensuring these funds but also being the main player domestically. And the politicians are willing to accept the role of the junior partner, in politics and in terms of the share of the money. Funds they too squirrel away while spending a wee bit on the populace.
Even though the past few years seemed to offer little to no chance of geostrategic rents, the ruling elite was and is reluctant to change its mad, bad ways. The previous PML-N government counted on CPEC; the PTI had hopes of investment from overseas Pakistanis; the 2022 floods led to talk of climate-related aid; then came the talk about investment from the Gulf. The common thread running through all this is the notion that some external flows would help end the crisis without the country having to go through the pain of reform and real adjustment.
It is noteworthy that this ‘hope’ was real even though it was accompanied by a public debate on critical economic challenges and problems, in terms of diagnosis and prescriptions — whether it was to increase the tax base or to reduce government spending at the centre or even amend the NFC. The detail with which these discussions took place was unprecedented. But for those in power, even as they took part in these discussions, the political will was missing. Bad habits formed over years are simply part of the explanation.
Another reason for this is also the challenge of legitimacy. Those in power, be it the PTI government in power or the present set-up, are so insecure they would rather offer immediate relief, however unsustainable, than go through the painful reform process.
It is this hope of immediate relief that led to the ‘chatter’ around the domestic implications of this pact. While much of this conversation was positive, there were also comments about the fear of Pakistan selling itself cheap. This stems no doubt from the view that post-9/11, Pervez Musharraf had been overly eager to join the US-led effort and had not bargained well enough. Whether or not one agrees with this view, there is no doubt that the decision allowed the general to successfully create the mirage of economic prosperity and buffer his regime.
Hence, it is no wonder that, however much the world and Pakistan’s place in it are changing, domestically, this pact is being viewed exactly the same way as some past moments — an opportunity to stabilise and sustain this set-up, along with the balance of power it has put in place.
However, it would be worth asking if the inflow that is being expected is going to be comparable to what came our way in the past — a question which requires the expertise of those more familiar with economic matters. But even if the sums are generous, what will this mean for the populace at large? For this elite consensus, for the most part, has also meant a complete disregard, if not wilful negligence, of the development of the people. And this neglect of the people will continue to pose the biggest challenge to the ruling elite, even if they are able to sustain the current set-up as well as successfully evade the criticism about the quality of democracy. It would be worth paying attention to this in the middle of celebrations.

• Expert says rare surgical procedure is carried out by a few centres in US, Canada
KARACHI: Amidst a constant flow of distressing news emerging from their hometown in flood-hit Multan, Sajid Hussain and his wife Samina find some solace when they look at their son Ayan today without feeling a surge of anxiety.
The five-year-old suffering from a potentially life-threatening heart condition has recently undergone a highly specialised surgery, brightening his chances to live a normal life.
The successful procedure — performed for the first time in Pakistan — was nothing less than a miracle for the family that has lost four children to the same illness before.
“After a long time, my heart is at peace; he hasn’t fallen ill even for once after the operation,” his mother Samina says, recalling that Ayan earlier used to react to any unpleasant thing by holding his breath, turning pale, and then fainting.
Married to her cousin, 30-something Samina had three stillbirths, too. With three surviving children including Ayan, the family is devastated by the ongoing floods that swept away their house and forced all loved ones to take shelter in relief camps.
“In these desperate times, Ayan gives us hope. We are too happy to see him, without a fear of losing him to the sudden illness,” she says.
While Sajid has been working in Karachi as a labourer since 2009, the family finally moved from their village in Multan to the city in 2023 when someone told them that Ayan could be treated for fainting free of cost here.
Ayan was initially treated at a public sector hospital from where he was referred to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD).
Life with disabilities
At the NICVD, Ayan was diagnosed to have a severe type of heart rhythm disorder that causes fast, chaotic heartbeats.
“He presented to us when he was three-and-a-half-year-old with multiple episodes of fainting and seizures. He has a severe type of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), a type of inherited arrhythmia syndrome,” shares Dr Muhammad Mohsin, who initiated and heads the inherited arrhythmia clinic at NICVD, the first of its kind in the country.
He explains that the heart is otherwise normal (in individuals with heartbeat disorders) but the heartbeat at times becomes fast and irregular and presents with either seizures or sudden cardiac death in young healthy individuals less than 30 years old.
“These are rare conditions but not that rare. For instance, the incidence of LQTS is estimated to be 1:2,500 live births. Consanguinity not only increases the risk (for these disorders) but also can cause the most severe phenotypes of disease as is in Ayan’s case. He is deaf and dumb that is part of the severe phenotype of LQTS.”
According to Dr Mohsin, also part of the team that conducted the surgery, the usual treatment of the heartbeat disorders is medication but if patient has cardiac arrest despite medication than implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) — a battery-powered device that detects and corrects abnormal heart rhythm — and/or surgery is needed.
“Initially, we put the device in but he had recurrent shocks every time his heartbeat became life threatening so we decided to proceed for the surgery known as left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD), which was not done before in Pakistan,” he said.
The surgery, Dr Mohsin pointed out, was considered because Ayan had very frequent shocks from ICD (almost every week up to four shocks in a day) and LCSD would help in reducing the frequency of those shocks.
Uniting for a cause
The LCSD, experts say, aims at reducing the overstimulation of the heart by removing specific nerves on the left side of the spine to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death.
The NICVD collaborated with the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) for the specialised minimally invasive heart surgery costing around Rs600,000. The much-needed financial assistance was met through the AKUH’s patients’ welfare programme and a donor’s support, ensuring that the family didn’t bear the burden.
“The operation went very well. It took us 21 minutes to carry out the procedure for which three incisions were made. The biggest one was 5mm and the other two were 3mm each. A camera was inserted through the [5mm] incision and the other two were used to insert the [surgical] equipment,” says Dr Saleem Islam, senior Paediatric Surgeon and Chair, Department of Surgery at Aga Khan University.
Few centres in the US and Canada, he says, carry out the rare surgical procedure and a lot of homework was done prior to the surgery to ensure its success.
Asked about the challenges faced, Dr Islam said: “The most difficult part was the patient selection. We knew we had to have the right family as this was the first time that we were doing the case anywhere.
“After that, it was the organisation with our anaesthesia colleagues because the anaesthesia part was the challenge too. Overall, what this case represents is how complex medical care has to be delivered by teams of experts in this day and age as no physician or surgeon can provide everything for everybody,” he said.

agreement
with Saudi Arabia.
According to a notification, in exercise of powers conferred by clause (1) of Article 54 of the Constitution, the president has summoned the National Assem­bly to meet at the Parliament Ho­­u­­­se on Sept 29 (Monday) at 5pm.
The upcoming sitting will be a regular session; earlier, a session had been called to discuss issues related to

It is worth mentioning that PM Shehbaz
addressed
the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly during his visit to the United States. On the occasion, he, along with Field Marshal Asim Munir, held meetings with US President Donald Trump and other key figures.
These meetings are being closely analysed in India, where there is a debate about the potential benefits for Pakistan and possible implications for India. Legislators are expected to be taken into confidence about the visit and the discussions held in the US.
Similarly, lawmakers may be briefed about the recently sig­n­­ed defence agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, which has drawn international attention.
Meanwhile, National Assem­bly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq has convened a meeting of parliamentary leaders at the Par­li­ament House on Monday at 4pm to discuss and finalise the agen­­da for the NA session. All parliamentary leaders have been notified about the meeting, which will be chaired by the speaker.
In another development, exercising his powers under clause (1) of Article 54 of the Constitution, President Zardari has summoned the Senate to meet at the Parliament House Sept 30 (Tuesday) at 4pm.
On the other hand, the main opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, has already announced a boycott of the parliamentary sessions and is therefore unlikely to attend.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944692,Judges’ transfer can’t be shot down over ‘individual gripe’ - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"• Seniority concerns cannot override constitutional transfers, holds Justice Mazhar
• Justice Panhwar suggests creating unified seniority list of all high court judges
ISLAMABAD: Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar on Thursday ruled that the transfer of a judge from one high court to another under Article 200(1) of the Constitution cannot be declared “against the public interest” merely because it affects the seniority of a few existing judges.
“The best interest of public at large is always with the expeditious disposal of their cases and not in forum shopping,” emphasised Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar in a detailed judgement.
Justice Mazhar had presided over the Supreme Court’s five-judge Constitutional Bench that heard a
joint petition
by five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — who had argued that three transferred judges, including IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, should not be treated as IHC judges until they took a fresh oath under Article 194, read with Schedule III of the Constitution.
Justice Mazhar observed that the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) had also filed a petition, initially fixed along with these petitions, but later withdrew it on April 17. This, he said, clearly showed that the parent bar association accepted the transfer of judges and did not consider it contrary to public interest or judicial independence.
Article 200 of the Constitution makes it clear that “public interest” is not a precedent or a hard and fast rule and the pros and cons are left to the consultees to decide, being the sole arbiters in terms of the relevant constitutional article.
Had the consultees felt that a proposed transfer was politically motivated, mala fide, or against public interest, they could have withheld consent during the consultation process. However, in this case, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and other chief justices of the high courts gave their unanimous assent.
“All the transfers were by consensus, and no transferee judge approached this court to claim that his transfer was made without consent, under duress, or for punitive or political reasons,” Justice Mazhar observed, adding that the CJP’s concurring note even applauded the transfer.
Nothing was articulated, Justice Mazhar noted, to explain how the transfers adversely affected public interest. “Has the IHC’s working come to a halt? Have the transferee judges failed led to perform their duties? Has the court stopped functioning?” he wondered.
On the issue of seniority, Justice Mazhar clarified that such disputes fall within the administrative authority of the high court’s chief justice. Whether the transfer was permanent or temporary, this should be specifically mentioned in the notification of transfer.
In a separate note, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar proposed the creation of a unified national seniority list of all high court judges. This list, he suggested, should be maintained and annually notified by the president’s office in consultation with the CJP, to apply specifically to IHC transfers, subject to the principle of diversity. Such a reform, he argued, would ensure transparency, equality and consistency in judicial administration and matters of elevation.

The bench formulated several questions for stakeholders, seeking their replies within a fortnight.
The bench also included as necessary parties in the petitions different stakeholders including secretaries of the ministries of interior, law and justice and human rights, Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, the director general of KP Judicial Academy, additional IGP of counter-terrorism department (CTD) and provincial health secretary.
Formulates queries for determination, seeks details of under-trial prisoners
The bench was hearing two public interest petitions filed by a citizen Asifullah and a senior lawyer Shabbir Hussain Gigyani, respectively.
In its 20-page detailed order, the bench announced constituting a larger bench comprising PHC Chief Justice SM Attique Shah, Justice Syed Arshad Ali, Justice Sahibzada Asadullah, Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan and Justice Salahud Din, which would hear the petitions in the second week of Oct.
Barrister Amirullah Khan Chamkani appeared for petitioner Asifullah and stated that CJS in KP had almost collapsed due to structural and procedural failures.
He said that those deficiencies collectively resulted in systematic violations of fundamental rights, particularly the right to fair trial guaranteed under Article 10A of the
Constitution
.
He said that people across the province were losing their precious lives, honour, dignity, respect and both moveable and immoveable properties, yet they were not receiving proper justice owing to grave shortcomings in the justice sector, including false implications, exaggerated charges, weak investigations, poor oversight by district public prosecutors, defective trials and flawed sentencing.
Similarly, petitioner Shabbir Gigyani has sought directives of the court for the respondents to ensure early submission of Challan (charge sheet) in terms of Section 173 of
Code of Criminal Procedure
(CrPC) and rules 6 and 7 of
National Judicial Policy
, 2009, as non-compliance thereof amounts to violation of articles 4, 9, and l0-A of the Constitution.
Several lawyers well-versed in criminal jurisprudence including Mohammad Nisar Khan, Mohammad Sareer Khan, Sahibzada Riazatul Haq, Syed Akber Ali Shah and Tafseel Khan Afridi appeared on court notice and put forward their opinions.
Apart from the advocate general, Shah Faisal Uthmankhel, and the additional advocate general, Inam Khan Yousafzai, the director general prosecution, Robin Haider Bukhari, also turned up in the case.
“As the constitutional court of the province, it is incumbent upon this court to take due notice of any violation of fundamental rights and any deviation or negligence in the application of laws relating to criminal justice system,” the bench observed.
It formulated around 20 questions for determination by the court in the light of assistance to be rendered by lawyers representing petitioners and respondents, law officers, director general prosecution and all other stakeholders.
Some of the questions are: Whether refusal of police to register an FIR in cognisable cases and its subsequent registration through an application under Section 22-A CrPC (justice of peace), renders police liable lo penal and compensatory consequences?
Whether a false, frivolous, or exaggerated FIR or complaint entails penal and compensatory liability for the complainant, as well as for the police officers, who facilitate such proceedings? Whether defective investigation, inadequate prosecutorial oversight, and delays or improper application of law and procedure by criminal courts are contributing factors to the low conviction rate in the country, particularly in the province of KP?
Whether the investigation branch of police is fully independent of the operational branch so as to effectively and independently perform its statutory duties? Whether the existing substantive and procedural criminal laws in force in KP are sufficient to meet the needs of modern times, particularly with reference to strengthening of CJS or whether they stand in need of revision?
Whether there exists any proper and effective oversight mechanism to hold various stakeholders of CJS, such as judiciary, police, prosecution, investigating officers, medico-legal officers, and jail authorities, accountable for non-compliance with their statutory duties and other mandatory provisions?
Whether independent forensic laboratory exists in KP, and if not, whether any measures have been taken to establish the same or otherwise? Whether prosecution is fulfilling its statutory duties as envisaged under
KP Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions and Powers) Act
, 2005, including but not limited to the duty of prosecutorial supervision?
Whether the failure of prosecution to submit Challans within the statutory period of 14 days, as mandated under Section 173 CrPC, amounts to a violation of fundamental rights of under-trial prisoners guaranteed under articles 4, 9, and 10-A of the Constitution, and whether such failure entails penal or compensatory consequences? Whether criminal trials are being concluded within the statutory period or not; and whether the law provides any remedial measures in cases where trials are not concluded within the specified period?
The bench also directed the DG prosecution to submit details about current pendency of cases before the prosecution department; number of district public prosecutors (DPPs) against whom departmental action was taken for poor oversight and low conviction rate; the number of cases in which DPPs had recommended action against investigating officers to relevant district police officers and their outcome; etc.
Similarly, the bench also put multiple questions to KP Forensic Science Agency, provincial health secretary and DIG investigation, directing them to submit their respective reports in the light of the said questions.

Central District Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi told
Dawn.com
that the factory building that originally caught fire collapsed, and four firemen were injured as a result.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan, in a statement, said, “Besides the four firefighters, a cameraman of a private TV channel was also injured due to the building collapse.”
New Karachi Industrial Area Station House Officer (SHO) Rizwan Qureshi told
Dawn.com
that the fire erupted at around 6:30am and factory building collapsed around noon.
According to SSP Siddiqi, the presence of diesel drums compounded the fire, which spread rapidly, engulfing two more industrial units in its vicinity.
The injured firefighters were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, while further checks were being carried out at the Civil Hospital Karachi and the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for any additional casualties.
The police officer identified the four injured persons as 50-year-old Ismail, 35-year-old Owais, 30-year-old Buland, and Aslam, also aged 30 years. “They are in a stable condition,” he added.
SSP Siddiqi and the central district commissioner supervised the firefighting operation.
According to an update shared by SHO Qureshi around 3.15pm, the fire was brought under control by then but the cooling work still ongoing.
Detailing the rescue operation, Haseeb said the firemen “immediately” responded after receiving information about the fire. A fire and rescue team, one ambulance and five fire tenders reached the spot and assisted in controlling the fire.
The Rescue 1122 claimed that the immediate response helped them in controlling the blaze, but the building collapsed due to the impact of the fire.
Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a
mix
of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
According to city planners and engineers,
70 per cent
of residential, commercial and industrial buildings in Karachi lacked an adequate fire safety system. Citing official data of the city’s fire department, Fire Protection Association President Kunwar Waseem said the city witnessed nearly 3,000 such incidents in 2024.
In late August, at least
six people
died in a fire that
broke out
after a massive explosion inside a warehouse in a densely populated area near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex.
Earlier that month, a massive blaze at a factory in the Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi

military operations

terrorism
.
Speaking at the Sindh Amn March organised by his party in Karachi, the Maulana said there could be no state within a state, but if a solution through dialogue was proposed, then it should be entertained by the authorities.
He, however, said no one had the right to take the law into their own hands. “It’s unacceptable for someone to carry guns, climb mountains and kill whoever they want calling it ‘Jihad’,” he said.
Besides the JUI-F leader, the PTI has also
opposed
military operations, particularly in KP, where terrorism has seen a spike after the Taliban government came to power in Afghanistan. Recently, PTI chief Imran Khan had also told his party’s chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur in KP to oppose the move.
Maulana Fazl appreciated the
defence pact
between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. He termed it a positive development for regional stability and a step towards greater unity in the Muslim world.
“We urge both nations to utilise this agreement not just for bilateral gains but for the collective benefit of the Islamic world. This accord should be made effective for the whole Muslim Ummah,” he said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939835/over-100-million-pakistanis-overweight-health-experts,Over 100 million Pakistanis overweight: health experts - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: Chronic obesity is silently killing and crippling thousands of relatively young Pakistanis every year, with new evidence showing that more than 100 million adults are now overweight or obese.
This was stated by national and international health experts at a moot in Islamabad.
They said the disease was fueling an alarming rise in diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, cancers, infertility and obstructive sleep apnea. They stressed that without urgent interventions, Pakistan will face an unprecedented public health disaster.
Dr Waseem Hanif, Professor of Diabetes and Endocrinology at the University of Birmingham, described obesity as “a normal response to an abnormal environment.”
He said nearly 2.5 billion people over 18 worldwide were overweight, and one billion were obese, adding that South Asians faced even higher risks at lower body weights.
“The ideal BMI is 18–25, but for South Asians it should be around 23. Obesity is a chronic disease that kills at a young age, cripples through sleep apnea, and destroys quality of life. In Pakistan, over 100 million people are obese. A revolutionary new treatment like tirzepatide is a fresh breeze — capable of reducing weight by up to 25 per cent — but it must go hand in hand with balanced diet and regular exercise. Obesity is a disease, and its main symptom is hunger,” he emphasised.
Prof. Saleem Qureshi, Head of Medicine at KRL Hospital Islamabad, said: “if current trends continue, over 57 per cent of Pakistani children will be obese by the time they reach 35 years of age. Obesity must be treated as a chronic disease with medication and lifestyle modification, because most Pakistanis seek medical care far too late,” he warned.
Echoing these concerns, Prof. Jamal Zafar noted: “Doctors must guide patients towards exercise, physical activity and a balanced diet. Exercise does not increase appetite — it reduces it. Lifestyle change is essential alongside treatment.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945580/petty-politics,Petty politics - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"IT is disappointing that the Indian cricket team felt compelled to engage in theatrics on what should have been a celebratory occasion.
Having
clinched
the Asia Cup after a thrilling contest with Pakistan, the side ought to have basked in its triumph. Instead, it spoiled the moment by
refusing
to accept the trophy from the Asian Cricket Council chief, because he is a Pakistani national.
That act of arrogance was not isolated. From its captain’s refusal to
shake
hands in the opening match to his overtly political comments in the post-match awards ceremony, the Indian cricket team’s behaviour seemed scripted to turn the game into another stage for New Delhi’s nationalist posturing. Their prime minister wasted no time in reinforcing this narrative,
describing
India’s victory as “Operation Sindoor on the games field”.
That he felt compelled to cast a sporting win in the language of war spoke less of confidence than of his insecurity, betraying the scars of his government’s military
misadventure
against Pakistan earlier this year.
The pettiness is particularly regrettable given cricket’s history in the region. Since the beginning, the game has seen fierce rivalry but also provided some rare occasions for goodwill between the two nations.
Vajpayee’s “friendship through cricket” initiative in 2004 and the 2011 World Cup semi-final in Mohali, famously attended by the prime ministers of both countries, reminded South Asians that sport offers respite from hostility. These occasions gave ordinary people a glimpse of what statesmanship and sportsmanship could achieve. India’s current approach is the opposite. Even as its team shone on the field, it chose to be arrogant off it, ensuring the tournament would be remembered less for its skill and more for its churlish behaviour. The disappointment is immense, especially for fans who turn to cricket for joy, not as a platform for leaders to flaunt their insecurities.
Equally troubling is the general political climate that feeds this behaviour. India insists on Pakistan’s culpability in the Pahalgam terrorist
attack
, but has yet to provide any compelling evidence. Its leaders repeat the allegation endlessly, as if that can substitute for proof. It was this unyielding stance that brought both countries to the brink of nuclear catastrophe earlier this year.
To now see the same rhetoric spilling into cricket is extremely dangerous. It narrows the space for peace, deepens mistrust, and denies the region any room for optimism. The Indian cricket team had a chance to show grace in victory; to remind millions that the sport can offer relief when politics fails. Instead, it left behind not only the trophy it refused to receive, but also a lasting impression of the country’s insecurities. The people of the two countries deserve better. Their shared love of the game should not be exploited in so crass a manner.

We were driving to Leeds, UK, for a family commitment. It is about 2,300 kilometres away from where we live in Javea, Spain, a small town on the Mediterranean coast, midway between Valencia and Alicante.
In my relatively younger days, we thought nothing of driving a thousand kilometres in a day. But now, in my not-so-young days, my family does not agree to any plan that involves such long drives. We drive about 600 km at most and make night stops after being on the road for no more than six to seven hours.
Our night stops decided, accommodation booked, we thought we’d be happily on our way. But the French had other ideas. They vehemently safeguard their rights and, despite voting in a Conservative president committed to curtailing public expenditure, resent any cuts that impact their lives, healthcare plans, pensions, retirement age, to name just a few.
So, when their government presented a plan in parliament aimed at addressing what it said was a 44 billion-euro hole in the finances, the first casualty was the prime minister, who was voted out — not the same significance as in our parliamentary democracy, because France’s president is all-powerful, with the power to appoint one prime minister after another, which he promptly did.
America’s unconditional support to Israel is forcing a rethink in the Middle East and beyond.
An impromptu strike call was given by some parties and unions last week, which was partially successful. Then, this past Thursday, all the main unions joined in the strike call and pledged to shut down the country.
Since our arrival date was not flexible and neither was our departure, we decided to drive from our home in Spain to Clermont Ferrand in France, a distance of 1,100 km because we could not take the chance of being stranded due to the strike at our original night stop in Perpignan, just across the border from Spain — a town where Spaniards used to drive to watch films which the censors would block during the Franco dictatorship in their country.
Our amended plan meant staying two nights in Clermont Ferrand, which is home to the famous Michelin Tyres with a huge manufacturing unit and research laboratory situated here. Our drive took us through the picturesque Massif Central via the Norman Foster-designed Millau Viaduct (the world’s tallest bridge), which we saw being constructed when we first drove through the area in 1995. We stayed at one of the motorway (called autoroute in France) hotels for two nights.
After the 10-hour, 1,100 km drive, when we finally got to the room, a shattered me received my good friend and
Dawn
Magazines editor Hasan Zaidi’s ‘this is huge’ WhatsApp message, sharing a link, carrying the story of Pakistan’s mutual defence
agreement
with Saudi Arabia.
For as long as I can remember, the two nations have had very close defence ties, with Pakistani troops based in Saudi Arabia in the past for not just training their army but also acting as a reserve force in an internal security role. Even then, I have never read anything nearly as categorical as “an attack on one will be considered an attack on both”.
After Chinese mediation in recent years led to not just de-escalation in tensions between traditional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, but also declarations of brotherhood, this defence accord can’t really be directed at Tehran.
In fact, it followed Israel’s missile
attack
on Qatari soil, apparently targeting the Hamas negotiating team said to be discussing a US proposal for hostage release and
ceasefire
in Gaza. Israel remained unapologetic and said it would again target its enemies wherever they were.
The attack seems to have brought home the realisation to the Arab Gulf leaders that the security umbrella the US extends to their states excludes protection from Israeli aggression as a totally different set of standards govern the conduct of the genocidal apartheid state.
“Pakistani military might, Saudi financial heft to redraw Gulf security map,” read the six-colu­­mn headline in
The News
, summing up the developm­ent. Whether the Gulf security map would be re­­drawn via this agreement will become clearer when the details emerge. But it has been signal­led that Saudi security won’t rely on a single sou­r­­ce, which proved unreliable in Qatar’s case. Qa­­tar was attacked despite being home to the US Ce­­ntral Command’s largest base in the Middle East.
Even the details, if made public, are unlikely to shed light on, for example, a nuclear umbrella for the kingdom. Equally, many Pakistanis would be keen to find out what kind of response the next possible aggression from India on our soil would evoke from Saudi Arabia. India is Saudi Arabia’s second-largest trading partner, while Saudi Arabia is India’s fifth.  Riyadh has pledged tens of billions of dollars in investment in India.
But America’s unconditional support to Israel is forcing a rethink not just in the Middle East ; it is leading to realignments beyond as well. Who knows if the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s collective or indivisible security may,  in the end, appear more appealing to the wealthy Arab Gulf states than reliance on the US, which has shown it supports Israeli ambitions at the expense of other allies, including those in the Gulf.
In fact, when the Muslim leaders’ emergency
meeting
in Qatar was calling upon the US to exerc­ise its influence over Israel for a ceasefire in Gaza, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was inaugurating the excavation of a tunnel (an ‘archaeological site’) which will end near the Al Aqsa Mosque and for which many Palestinians have been forcibly evicted from their homes in Jerusalem. Against this backdrop, the US-end­orsed Gaza genocide continues, billions around the world who oppose it are powerless to stop it.

implicates
Naeem Haider Pan­jutha and several others.
The party has described it as a blatant act of political victimisation.
In a statement issued by the PTI central media de­partment on Wednes­day, the party spokesperson claimed that the FIR was initially registered un­­der sections 506, 147, 149, 382, and 427 of the Pa­­kistan Penal Code. How­e­v­­er, in what the party ter­med a “shocking abuse of law,” terrorism clauses were later inserted overnight.
“When our people appeared before ordinary courts in the morning, they were forcibly dragged before an Anti-Terrorism Court — a glaring testament to political victimisation and manipulation of the justice system,” the statement read.
PTI claimed the case was entirely fabricated and rooted in sheer political revenge. It added that, unfortunately, the Punjab Police and the provincial government had effectively become a printing press for ‘fake’ FIRs — particularly targeting members of Imran Khan’s family.
The party said Aleema was being targeted solely for supporting her brother, Imran Khan, and for conveying his message to the nation. The spokesperson described her as a dignified and courageous woman, and reaffirmed PTI’s firm support for her.

“The Indian sponsored
kharjis
attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by the vigilant and resolute response by own troops. In their desperation, the
kharjis
rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij
is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The ISPR added that in a display of “unwavering courage and professional excellence”, troops engaged the terrorists with precision and eliminated all five of them. The ISPR said six soldiers belonging to the FC and Pakistan Army were martyred in the intense exchange of fire after “putting up a heroic fight”.
The ISPR said the clearance operation in the area would continue and the perpetrators of the “heinous and cowardly act” would be brought to justice.
“The security forces of Pakistan in step with nation remain steadfast in their resolve to eradicate Indian sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further strengthen our unwavering commitment of safeguarding our nation at all costs,” it concluded.
Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of
attacks
, particularly targeting police personnel in
Bannu

Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan earlier told

Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed said during a media briefing that police, army and FC personnel swiftly responded to the attack and killed four within an hour of the attack and later the fifth was also eliminated.
The IG said a clearance and search operation was carried out at the site. The operation’s conclusion was later confirmed by RPO Khan.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.

carve relentless paths
through South Punjab, submerging villages and livelihoods, and now approaching with higher intensity through the Indus to Sindh, Pakistan stands at a crossroads.
The 2025 floods — perhaps as devastating as the
2022 disaster
but with even bigger dimensions, making them among the worst in recent history — have claimed over 842 lives (some sources estimate over 1,000), displaced 1.2 million people, affected more than 4m, mainly in Punjab, and threatened economic losses between $6–10 billion thus far.
Yet, amid the chaos of rescue and relief, a powerful opportunity emerges to document the crisis in real time, harnessing community voices — especially women’s — to build a resilient future. By blending local insights with global best practices, Pakistan can transform this disaster into a catalyst for systemic change.
A nation under water
Perhaps, this is bigger than a war — those have dry spaces and pauses. But here, the battle is against water that advances like a warfront; it is everywhere.
The 2025 monsoon has unleashed a dual assault of river and rain-induced flooding. In South Punjab, districts such as Multan, Bahawalpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan are
inundated
, with over 4m residents affected and 1,400 villages submerged under 5–10 feet of water.
In Sindh, the Guddu Barrage
braces for peak inflows
of 800,000 cusecs by September 10 or 11, putting downstream areas and 1.6 million
katcha
residents on high alert. Urban centres — Lahore, Rawalpindi, Karachi, and Hyderabad — face flash floods, with clogged drains and 50 per cent higher runoff due to rapid urbanisation.
The echoes of the current crisis bring back bad memories of the 2022 floods, when a third of the country was submerged and 33 million people were displaced. But here’s the scary part: the intensity of the deluge this year — driven by climate change and upstream water coming from India through a destined gradient — exposes persistent vulnerabilities.
Over 100,000 animals have perished, cotton crops face 20pc–30pc losses, and school closures disrupt critical exams. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)
reports
over 155,000 rescues in Punjab alone, yet bottlenecks in boats, helicopters, and supply chains underscore systemic gaps.
The power of real-time planning
Disasters demand more than reactive aid; they require strategic foresight. The World Meteorological Organisation’s (WMO) Integrated Flood Management (IFM) framework emphasises real-time data to balance prevention with sustainable development.
By documenting bottlenecks, inundation patterns, and community experiences now, Pakistan can lay the groundwork for resilient recovery. “Every crisis is a classroom,” says Naseer Memon, a water and disaster risk reduction expert. “Notes taken today — on what fails, what works, and who’s most affected — can rewrite tomorrow’s playbook.”
The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction’s (UNDRR) Sendai Framework also underscores this, advocating iterative learning to bridge institutional silos.
In Pakistan, where coordination between federal and provincial disaster management authorities often falters, structured documentation can align efforts. The Global Flood Partnership’s worldwide monitoring network shows how satellite data, like Nasa’s Global Precipitation Measurement Mission, predicts patterns, optimising resources.
Similarly, the Google Flood Hub provides important insights and forecasting for floods.

Women, comprising 60pc of relief and rescue camp populations, face unique burdens: childcare, limited mobility, and risks of gender-based violence. The World Bank’s research reveals women are disproportionately excluded from early warnings and resources, increasing their vulnerability.
In 2022, Pakistan’s failure to include local voices led to mismatched aid; 2025 demands better. Women’s miseries have been reported from Lahore camps and many other places.
Focus groups in camps — prioritising women — reveal sanitation woes, privacy deficits, and hygiene gaps. Social media posts on various platforms call for resilient housing and disaster risk reduction (DRR) training, echoing Bangladesh’s success with community-led adaptations like elevated homes and floating gardens, which cut flood damages by 40pc.
This is the time to do it differently for women, children, and the elderly. It should go beyond words and rituals.
Bottlenecks and breakthroughs
Rescue operations highlight both triumphs and failures. The NDMA’s app-based alerts enabled 259 swift rescues, but insufficient boats and helicopter shortages stranded families in South Punjab. Supply chains crumble under flooded roads, delaying the UN’s $5 million aid package. Medical facilities strain under 1,117 injuries, with cholera risks looming due to weak disease surveillance.
In urban areas, flash floods paralyse markets like Hyderabad’s, worsened by 10–14-hour electricity breaks. These power outages during rain are universal across Pakistan’s cities and towns, with some areas going without power for days. This aggravates urban flooding, as pumping becomes hampered.
The white elephant of the Water and Power Development Authority has given birth to Hesco and other monsters that have entangled the entire energy supply network. The distribution networks need to be overhauled with complete management change. This must be considered an important step for better preparedness for disaster management, including flood management, in Pakistan.
Structural issues — leaky canals losing 30–40pc of water, clogged urban drains, nonexistent stormwater management for cities — and non-structural ones, such as absolutely weak land-use planning with no concept of geographical planning, and deforestation across the country, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan, amplify the crisis.
Alleged upstream water releases from India add geopolitical strain; this necessitates basin-level planning for both flood and drought management. Inundation patterns show rapid pluvial buildup in South Punjab’s low-lying farmlands, escalating within 24–48 hours, with 2025 volumes 20pc higher than 2022.
Global lessons, local solutions
So when it comes to learning, there are international case studies that offer blueprints for Pakistan.
Japan’s Yokohama uses public-private detention systems to manage 82 mm/hour rainfall, slashing runoff by 75pc via permeable pavements. Jakarta’s tidal barriers and community warnings tackle pluvial-fluvial overlaps, while Shenzhen’s spatial planning curbs urban inequities. Bangladesh’s community radio saved lives during the 2013 cyclones, and its Netherlands-backed Delta Plan 2100 pioneers sustainable flood defences. Bangladesh’s flood experiments foster collaborative capacity-building, a model for Pakistan’s fragmented response.
The Associated Programme on Flood Management (APFM) champions participatory vulnerability assessments, ensuring gender equity. A global review of 80 documents stresses context-specific research to empower communities. Pakistan’s 2022 “build back better” approach — elevated housing — reduced future damages; broader inclusion of locals closed response gaps.
To operationalise real-time planning, stakeholders can adopt this checklist, inspired by global frameworks like the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s after-action reviews and WMO’s Integrated Flood Management tools:
Document daily:
Log rescue bottlenecks, supply chain delays, and medical gaps by PDMAs/NDMA and the Revenue Department. This needs to reflect what one observes, how people express their problems, and the important solutions they offer. Never underestimate their knowledge. Local people are the first responders. This daily diary should be available at least at the tehsil level.
Map patterns:
Use satellite data to track inundation trends, focusing on prone areas. Initiate the marking of water levels, mapping water gradient patterns and lines, and other important on-ground information that can be highly helpful for planning.
Engage communities:
Seek input from communities, especially women,  to capture needs, prioritising hygiene and safety.
Assess infrastructure:
Identify failing assets, noting where, why, and to what extent.
Integrate urban-rural plans:
Address pluvial-fluvial synergies via climate modelling. As some towns have been flooded first by rainfall and then by river overflows during emergent conditions, prepare a long list at the tehsil level.
Evaluate and learn:
This should be a weekly task for one or two hours by respective PDMAs and the revenue departments. The regular meetings carried out in different offices, mainly led by deputy commissioners, the PDMA, or local ministers and legislators (or ministers on special duty), focus on key urgent problems, but these are rarely minuted; when done so, they provide superficial information rather than the crucial discussions that take place. This must be given time and a dedicated role so that when floodwaters recede, they provide both geographical and spatial problem and solution lists. Conduct post-flood audits to refine strategies, ensuring gender-sensitive aid.
The 2025 floods are not just a disaster — they’re a call to reimagine resilience. By weaving community voices, especially women’s, into real-time planning, Pakistan can break the cycle of devastation. Notes scribbled amid the deluge — on bottlenecks, patterns, and solutions — can become the cornerstone of a safer, stronger nation. With global wisdom and local resolve, this crisis can spark a revolution in preparedness, ensuring no flood catches us off guard again.

flights
between the two countries.
The Uzbek embassy in Islamabad said on Wednesday that Uzbekistan and Pakistan continued to strengthen their friendly relations and expand cooperation across multiple sectors. In this process, transport and logistics, particularly air connectivity, played a crucial role.
Starting October 28, the frequency of flights on ‘Tashkent-Islamabad-Tashkent’ route will be doubled, from once a week to two flights per week.
Currently, Uzbekistan Airways operated flights twice a week — on Wednesdays and Fridays — on the ‘
Tashkent-Lahore-Tashkent
’ route, and once a week (on Saturdays) on the ‘
Tashkent-Islamabad-Tashkent
’ route.
Due to consistently high demand, with flights running at full passenger capacity and tickets selling out several days in advance, the airline had decided to expand its flight schedule.
The Embassy of Uzbekistan said increase in flight frequency would not only provide greater convenience for travelers but also foster closer trade and economic cooperation, encourage business partnerships and support more frequent exchanges between the two nations.
The embassy said these additional flights would also strengthen cultural and humanitarian ties between the brotherly peoples of Uzbekistan and Pakistan.
Furthermore, the expansion of flights offers significant advantages for international travelers. Tashkent International Airport serves as a strategic transit hub, providing convenient connections from Pakistan to destinations across Europe, North America, and Asia. This made Uzbekistan Airways an attractive option for passengers seeking smooth and efficient travel to global destinations.
According to the Uzbek embassy, the regular expansion of flight frequencies was a strategic step for both Uzbekistan and Pakistan, reflecting the growing partnership between the two nations and taking bilateral relations to a new level of cooperation and connectivity.

wheat stocks
and ordered a crackdown on hoarders.
“Launch strict action against those involved in illegal storage of wheat,” the CM said while presiding over a meeting in this regard.
As per a handout, she announced a three-day grace period for all wheat stockists to voluntarily declare their inventory or face action. Legal action will be initiated against those who fail to comply after the deadline expires.
She said no action would be taken against those who truthfully declare their wheat stocks. She emphasised the need for accurate identification and reporting of wheat stockpiles in the province. She asserted that those who were attempting to exploit flood crisis would not be shown any leniency.
Hoarded wheat worth millions seized in Bahawalpur
She said certain elements were trying to create artificial shortage of wheat, which would not be tolerated under any circumstances. “The government must demonstrate its writ to protect public interests and ensure stability in the wheat and flour markets”.
The CM directed Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (Pera) to conduct continuous inspections and enforcement across Punjab. She also directed them to get government price lists prominently displayed at all retail outlets, as stern action would be taken against the violators.
In response to the loss of wheat stocks in Khanewal due to flooding, she expressed indignation and directed the authorities concerned to take immediate disciplinary action to get the situation fixed. The CM removed the food department director general for failing to transport wheat to a safe and secure place in time, while the district food controller (DFC) of Khanewal, including entire local staff, have been suspended from service.
The CM said all available resources must be utilised to detect wheat hoarders. Necessary steps should be taken to maintain stable prices of wheat and flour throughout the province, she said.
BAHAWALPUR:
In pursuance of orders from the Punjab government, joint teams comprising food department officials and Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (Pera) staff launched a crackdown on wheat hoarders in Bahawalpur district on Tuesday.
The authorities claimed to have seized thousands of maunds of hoarded wheat worth millions of rupees and sealed the godowns of the owners.
According to Bahawalpur District Food Controller Khadim Hussain Faraz, during a raid on the godown of Chaudhry Brothers Cotton Factory in Khairpur Tamewali, the joint team recovered 50,000 bags of hoarded wheat valued at Rs190 million.
The seized wheat was sent for grinding in flour mills to be sold at government-regulated prices. The factory’s godown was sealed.
In another operation, the Mason Factory in Khanqah Sharif was raided, resulting in the seizure of 11,000 wheat bags worth Rs40m with the godown also sealed. As many as 14,000 bags worth Rs50m were seized from a resident, Amjad Bhatti, of Qasim Shah. Hundreds of wheat bags were confiscated during a raid at a shop in Ghalla Mandi, Bahawalpur.
Similar raids were conducted in grain markets of Hasilpur and Yazman, recovering hoarded wheat worth hundreds of thousands of rupees, and sealing the respective godowns.
Khadim Hussain Faraz said hoarders who declare their stock will be exempt from action but must hand over their stock to the food department for disposal at government prices.
Flour bags of 10 and 20 kilograms are currently available in Bahawalpur at Rs905 and Rs1,810, respectively.

Investigating Officer (IO) Sajjad Ali brought the suspect, under tight security with his face covered with a chador, before Judicial Magistrate (South) Sagar Khan Abro after the completion of his initial remand.
The rape survivors and their parents were also present within the court premises.
The IO stated in court that the suspect had been nominated in at least six rape cases and had allegedly confessed to the crime before the police.
Statements of minor survivors to be recorded today
He added that the suspect’s custody was required to record the statements of the minor girl survivors under Section 164 of the
Criminal Procedure Code
(CrPC) before the magistrate concerned.
Meanwhile, another IO, Sohaib, informed the court that a separate case had been registered against the suspect at the Defence police station under Section 11/3 of the
Sindh Information of Temporary Residents Act
.
The officer said the police had raided a rented house where the suspect was living and found that he had been residing there without any tenancy agreement, which constituted an offence under the Act.
He added that a case had also been lodged against the house owner, who had yet to be arrested.
After hearing both IOs and the state prosecutor, the court extended the physical custody of the suspect for a further three days and directed that he be produced at the next hearing.
It is pertinent to mention that after obtaining the suspect’s physical custody, IO Sajjad moved an application before Judicial Magistrate (South) Kalsoom Mustafa Sahto, seeking permission to record the statements of four survivor girls.
The court allowed the application and fixed Thursday (today) for recording the statements, which are to be recorded in the presence of the suspect.
According to police, the suspect came to Qayyumabad in 2016 and started luring and trapping children around 2019. He first opened a grocery shop, and then a juice cart.
The police said that the matter came to the authorities’ attention after one of his alleged victims managed to obtain a USB drive from the suspect. The victim then took the USB to a video shop for the purpose of downloading music onto it, but the shop owner detected the presence of explicit content on the drive and informed area residents, who apprehended the suspect and beat him up before handing him over to the police.

wheat supply
amid claims about a 68 per cent hike in
flour prices
across the province.
Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle criticised the Punjab government for ‘restricting’ wheat movement from the province to KP, insisting the move has caused a crisis-like situation in their province.
With Speaker Babar Saleem Swati chairing the session, they warned if the Punjab government didn’t immediately lift the ban on wheat supply, KP would suspend supply of electricity, gas and oil to Punjab.
“The unconstitutional restrictions on wheat movement from Punjab to KP have created uncertainty and unrest among the people of the province,” read the resolution moved by PPP member Ahmad Karim Kundi.
Lawmakers claim 68pc hike in flour prices across province
It said the house expressed serious concerns over the illegal sealing of inter-provincial borders by the Punjab government obstructing the delivery of wheat to KP.
The resolution said such moves violated Article 151 of the Constitution, which guaranteed free trade and goods across the provinces.
Mr Kundi urged the government of KP to take up the matter with the federal and Punjab governments to ensure “constitutional compliances and uninterrupted supply of essential commodities, including wheat.
The resolution was also signed by food minister Zahir Shah Toru, excise minister Khaleequr Rehman, law minister Aftab Alam Afridi, and MPAs Shafi Jan and Riaz Shaheen. The debate on wheat shortage and hike in flour prices was started by PTI member Shafi Jan.
He said the rate of a 20kg wheat flour bag had gone up from Rs1,300 to Rs2,500.
“The Punjab government’s ban on wheat supply has no justification and instead, it violates the Constitution,” he said.
Mr Jan said that the KP government had never halted supply of gas, electricity and oil to the Punjab but the Punjab government “regularly” stopped wheat supply to KP.
Member of the opposition JUI-F Adnan Khan said that the Punjab government had set up checkposts and was not allowing the transportation of wheat to KP.
He said the ban on wheat supply had triggered a “crisis-like situation” in KP as poor residents couldn’t buy flour at inflated rates.
Mr Khan urged political parties, which are part of the ruling coalition in the Centre, to take up the issue with the prime minister and Punjab government before “the situation deteriorates.”
He said that if the Punjab government didn’t follow the Constitution and laws on the issue, then the KP government, too, should take adverse action by stopping the supply of electricity, gas and oil produced by KP to Punjab.
Food minister Zahir Shah Toru informed the house that a 68 per cent increase had been reported in flour prices since the Punjab government halted wheat supply lately.
He said that flour prices had also gone up in other provinces, mainly due to the hoarding of wheat in Punjab.
“KP produces 1.472 metric ton wheat annually, while it fulfills the remaining requirement by purchasing wheat and flour from Punjab. The KP government is not allowed to purchase wheat from other countries and is mainly dependent for it on Punjab,” he said.
The minister said that wheat supply from Punjab was banned by notifications from districts bordering KP and not the Punjab government in an inappropriate move. He said that people in KP were badly hit by terrorist attacks and the recent floods, and the increase in four prices had added to their misery.
Mr Toru said KP would have to purchase wheat at high prices, paying an additional Rs5 billion.
The house also passed the KP Local Government (Amendment) Act 2025.
The chair later adjourned the session until next Monday (Sept 15).

FM Dar is part of a delegation being led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at a high-level segment of the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) from today, drawing the attention of the international community towards the “grave crisis” in Gaza and calling for “decisive action” to end the suffering of Palestinians, according to a statement by the government.
World leaders gather in New York every September for several days of speeches at the annual UNGA session.
Addressing a UNSC session on the Middle East, FM Dar said: “Gaza has become a graveyard for humanity and the global conscience. We call upon the Security Council and the broader international community to act decisively, to uphold human dignity, to ensure accountability and deliver justice.
“The time for words has passed, the time for action is now.”
Reiterating the damage and devastation in Gaza, along with the numerous people killed and the plight of those still surviving, he said the humanitarian situation had reached “catastrophic proportions” with the people starving and famine gripping the territory.
He said Pakistan welcomed France’s summit on the two-state solution, co-sponsored with Saudi Arabia, and commended the recent recognition of the Palestinian state by more UN members, saying it “reflects adherence to justice and the principle of international law”.
FM Dar also addressed the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Committee of Six on Palestine, reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause.
Stressing that this was a “defining moment” for the Muslim world, he called on the OIC to press urgently for a permanent ceasefire, unrestricted humanitarian access, an end to illegal settlements, accountability for war crimes, reconstruction of Gaza under the Arab-OIC plan, and the protection of Palestinian lives.

According to a statement issued by the Finance Division, “The ECC considered a summary regarding the commercial import of used vehicles and, after detailed discussion, accorded approval to the proposals.”
Initially, only vehicles not older than five years will be permitted until 30th June 2026, after which the vehicle age limit shall stand removed, it added.
As per the statement, Federal Finance and Revenue Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired the ECC meeting virtually from New York.
The ECC further directed that “such commercial importation would remain subject to strict compliance with prescribed environmental and safety standards”.
“The committee also approved the imposition of 40 per cent regulatory duty in addition to the existing customs duties, on the commercial import of used vehicles (less than five years old),” it added.
“This enhanced duty will remain applicable until 30th June 2026. Thereafter, the duty shall be reduced gradually by 10 percentage points per year, reaching zero by 2029-30, in line with the recommendations of the Tariff Policy Board.”
The statement further read that on another summary moved by the Cabinet Division, the ECC considered and approved a technical supplementary grant of Rs800 million in favour of the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA).
The ECC’s decisions will now be approved by the federal cabinet.
The meeting was attended by Federal Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik, Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain, Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari, federal secretaries and senior officials from concerned ministries and regulatory bodies, the statement concluded.
Last month, local auto parts manufacturers
warned
of a potential shutdown of Pakistan’s car assembly industry within the next two years if the government proceeded with plans to liberalise the commercial import of used vehicles from September.
Former chairman of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM), Aamir Allawala, raised concerns during a media briefing at various vending units, stating that used vehicles already account for 25pc of the market — over 40,000 units annually. In contrast, used car market share stands at zero in India, 0.3pc in Vietnam, and 1.2pc in Thailand, he noted.
Allawala said import duties on completely built-up (CBU) units in Pakistan range from 50–100pc, compared to 125pc in India, 52pc in Vietnam, and 80pc in Thailand. The negligible used car imports in these countries are the result of both tariff and administrative measures, he added.
In May, as the International Monetary Fund was pushing the government for rationalisation of tariffs on the auto industry, the All Pakistan Car Dealers and Importers Association (APCDIA)
urged

The PTI alleged that she was arrested in Islamabad last night.
Her lawyer, Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq, confirmed to

today that she was arrested in the fake videos case.
“My team and I will appear in Lahore District Court tomorrow in Falak Javed’s case. We will provide full legal assistance in Falak Javed’s case. If NCCIA applies for Falak Javed’s physical remand, we will oppose it. The case is being reviewed from all angles,” he said.
The Punjab minister had sought action last year in July against the persons involved in sharing her edited images on social media. She alleged that Falak edited and spread her images on social media.
The minister said a request was made to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) under the Peca (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) to take action against Falak and others, but the agency did not take any action.
The minister argued that she had been defamed on social media and that her constitutional rights had been violated.
In her petition, she asked the court to order the FIA to take action against the respondents and submit a compliance report.",2025-09-24,Rana Bilal,341,8.6e-05
https://www.dawn.com/news/1941378/bajaur-operation-averted-militant-buildup-in-kp-officials,‘Bajaur operation averted militant buildup in KP’: officials - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"PESHAWAR: Amid renewed
opposition
to military action to root out militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, officials on Thursday said the targeted
operation
in Bajaur, continuing at a steady pace, was necessary to contain militants in the tribal district, which serves as a “transit route” to nine other districts.
According to officials, a failure to act in time would have “serious security implications” for at least 10 other districts and further complicated the security situation in the province bordering Afghanistan. A civil administration official told
Dawn
that the militants would have overrun KP had they not been contained in the upper reaches of Bajaur.
“The district serves as a transit route to nine districts of Malakand division as well as Katlang in Mardan. All these areas are interconnected,” the official said, while referring to the districts of Upper and Lower Dir, Shangla, Swat, Buner, Malakand, and Katlang in Mardan.
Another official said that the “threat projection was big” and the situation would have been more difficult to handle if timely action had not been taken. The targeted action, the official said, forced a large number of militants to flee and they were now believed to have concentrated in regions close to the border.
The official said the security forces cleared 11 of the 36 areas and over 3,000 families, who were temporarily displaced, had returned to their homes.
“We thought that Damadola and Kitkot with build-up areas would turn out to be tough. Militants have now retreated from the area and we are in the process of sanitisation before allowing people to return to their homes and hearths,” the official said.
Damadola, about seven kilometres from the Afghan border, has always been a militant hotbed. It gained national and international attention in January 2006 when a number of students were killed in a
strike on a seminary
. Initially thought to be a US strike, reportedly targeting Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, Pakistan’s military eventually claimed the action as its own.
Officials believed that if the targeted action continued at the same pace, remaining areas could be cleared in the near future and people would be able to return home ahead of winter. Bajaur, the official claimed, could serve as a model in other districts affected by militancy.
This was the first time a targeted area-wise operation was launched by engaging the local population, who were encouraged to ask militants to leave the area to avoid displacement and damage to their property.
Authorities began the process of engagement with the area notables on July 30. Negotiations continued for fourteen days but following the militants’ refusal to leave the area, residents agreed to vacate their areas for the targeted operation.
A document seen by
Dawn
revealed that the notables acknowledged that the protection of life and property was the responsibility of the state, thus empowering the security forces to establish the writ of the state. The document also emphasised that efforts would be made to minimise the damage to the property and allow for compensation.
This enabled the security forces to undertake action without fear of harming and causing civilian casualties and damage to properties, the official added.
Accordingly, 21,000 families left their homes, out of which 8200 were provided shelter at government-owned buildings, while 12,800 stayed with the community. “The most remarkable thing was to facilitate the return of people to six villages of Tarkho within five days of their displacement on August 21. Subsequently, six more areas were cleared and residents were allowed to return on September 8,” the official said.

unfortunate incident
” that took place with her — a reference to her exchange with IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar — earlier this week.
In her application to the IHC registrar,which Mazari shared on X, she said: “I write to you today to seek [the] preservation of CCTV footage of the Honourable Chief Justice’s courtroom no.1 from September 11, 2025 between 9am and 11am, as an unfortunate incident took place with the undersigned counsel, as a result of which it is imperative that the exchange recorded on the CCTV footage is preserved.
“I would also request [the] provision of a copy of the CCTV footage from the aforementioned date and time on the USB I have annexed herewith this instant application.”
The proceedings that Mazari referred to in her application are from a hearing on Thursday, during which she represented her client — who sought the removal of rights activist Mahrang Baloch’s name from the Exit Control List — in the court of IHC CJ Dogar.
At the hearing, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting hold of her”.
For her part, Mazari had said that she was only fulfilling her professional duty and was prepared to face contempt proceedings if the court deemed it necessary.
A day later at the hearing of another case, Justice Dogar
provided a clarification
on the matter, saying that his words were presented out of context. He also denied saying anything along the lines of “getting hold of” Mazari — a claim contested by Mazari’s husband Hadi Ali Chattha who also attended Thursday’s hearing.
In his clarification, Justice Dogar also said that Mazari was “like a daughter” to him, and he was only trying to explain things to her the previous day.
“I was explaining to her just as (I would) to a child, but she was not understanding. She was repeatedly mentioning fundamental rights. Does this court not have any fundamental rights,” he said.
His remarks drew
criticism
from the country’s legal fraternity and Mazari herself, who termed his remarks “sexist”.
A number of lawyers’ bodies and bar associations issued statements condemning the IHC CJ’s behaviour, with some even demanding that he be removed from his office.
The Lahore High Court Bar Association strongly condemned the exchange, saying that lawyers were “officer[s] of the court” and their respect and dignity should be prioritised, just like those of respected judges. It urged the Supreme Judicial Council to remove Justice Dogar from his post.
This demand was echoed by the Balochistan Bar Council as well, while the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) strongly condemned the “highly inappropriate conduct” of Justice Dogar.
The Women’s Action Forum was also outraged by the judge’s reported remarks, and condemned the “highly objectionable patriarchal misogynist anti-women remarks and behaviour … patronising language employed in addressing and instructing the lawyer’s spouse…”.",2025-09-13,Tahir Naseer,793,0.000119
https://www.dawn.com/news/1940833/sc-fixes-three-month-summer-break-under-new-rules,SC fixes three-month summer break under new rules - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"• Routine leave requests will require CJP’s approval
• Court offices to remain open during vacations, except public holidays
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has fixed its three-month summer vacation for 2026 under the newly framed
Supreme Court Rules 2025
, even as debate continues within the top court over the scope and regulation of judges’ leave.
The annual vacation will run from June 15 to Sept 14, 2026, under Rule 4 of Order II of the new rules, which replaced the 1980 framework.
A full court meeting on Monday, presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and attended by 19 of the 24 sitting judges, approved the rules. The judges agreed that the new rules, described as a living document, will be subject to review and amendment as needed.
Judicial leave has already become a contentious issue. In his address at the opening of the new judicial year on Monday, the CJP noted that while judges may take holidays during annual vacations, routine leave requests during the working year fall within his discretion under the stated criteria.
“The notification is a kind of forerunner for judges to accumulate and plan their holidays for the next vacations in advance,” commented a senior counsel on condition of anonymity.
According to the SC notification, off­ices will remain open during the vacations except on public holidays. Urgent and criminal cases, along with matters fixed under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023 and Article 191A of the Constitution, will continue before available benches as directed by the three-judge committee.
The July 29 General Standing Order (GSO), issued under the Supreme Court Judges (Leave, Pension and Privileges) Order 1997, also uploaded on the court’s website, empowered the CJP to approve leave with due diligence in the interest of public service. It required all types of leave to be applied for in advance and supported by cogent reasons.
For judges proceeding abroad, a no-objection certificate is mandatory. Pri­vate foreign visits should be confined to summer or winter vacations, except in cases of pilgrimages, official nominations, awards, medical emergencies, or children’s graduation ceremonies. Jud­ges on leave must provide current contact details, and in case of official visits abroad, the Foreign Ministry will arr­ange facilitation and protocol, according to the GSO.
In response, senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah
wrote
a seven-page letter to the CJP on Sept 4. He expressed surprise that, for the first time, the GSO described judges as being at the whole-time disposal of the state — language he termed wholly alien to a constitutional court.
He stressed that judges are not regimented officers but independent under the Constitution.
Justice Shah also noted that the GSO restricted ex-Pakistan leave to five categories, which are not envisaged in the Presidential Order No. 2 of 1997. He reg­retted that even invitations from leading global institutions such as Yale and Har­vard universities and recognised professional bodies like the New York City Bar Association had been refused on what he described as flimsy grounds.
“Such engagements are not personal leisure but opportunities to carry the institutional presence of this court to global forums, enriching jurisprudence and credibility,” the letter stated.
Justice Shah maintained that leave could only justifiably be refused where a part-heard case cannot be adjourned, urgent administrative duty requires pre­sence, or a judge is neglecting work. He regretted that leave was being denied even when none of these conditions app­lied, apparently to enforce compliance and limit independent judges from addr­essing international forums.
“Such arbitrary denials betray a deep institutional insecurity,” Justice Shah had observed.

The child had been abducted when he was returning from school on Saturday.
After learning about the abduction, a team was constituted that raided the house of the alleged criminal, Saifuddin, who was wanted in 13 cases.
The raid was led by district police officer Jehanzeb Mohmand, SP investigations, DSP Thall and SHO Doaba.
The police said the outlaw opened fire at the police party after sighting it, which was duly retaliated, leading to his killing. The child was rescued safely. He was immediately shifted to hospital as his condition was ‘critical’.
The DPO said drug sellers and other criminals could not escape the long arm of law and they would be eliminated for the safety of the lives and property of the people and peace in Hangu.
Regional police officer Abbas Majeed Marwat praised the successful operation, claiming that Khyber Pakhtunkwa police would continue to make efforts for a crime-free society.

• Sutlej River forms 20-25km inland lake along Gilani Road-M5 stretch
• Official admits controlled breach into Chenab might have reduced damage
• One dead as boat capsizes in Muzaffargarh; three of a family drown in Alipur
LAHORE: In a catastrophic escalation of Punjab’s
flood disaster
, a massive new section of the Multan-Sukkur Motorway  (M5) was completely washed away near Jalalpur Pirwala, severing a vital national infrastructure link and stranding the region for the eighth consecutive day.
The breach, which rapidly expanded due to unrelenting water pressure from the Sutlej River, has now devoured all six lanes of both tracks, paralysing all traffic between southern and central Punjab. The collapse has disrupted supply chains, stranded thousands of vehicles and forced travellers onto perilous alternate routes.
“This is the second major breach to cripple the M5,” confirmed an Irrigation Department spokesperson. “The new breach is actively widening. Our emergency teams are working around the clock, placing boulders in a desperate attempt to stabilise the ground.”
The scale of the disaster is vast. The Sutlej River has effectively created a 20 to 25km-long inland lake between Gilani Road and the M5 motorway, submerging and damaging the highway along its entire length in the area.
A district administration official, speaking to
Dawn
on condition of anonymity, revealed that the scale of the damage might have been mitigated by a difficult decision. “It would have been better to make a controlled breach on the motorway to pass the Sutlej River water into the Chenab, but the decision was not taken in time,” the official stated.
Due to medium level flood in the Sutlej River, thousands of people were being evacuated from Multan, Lodhran and Bahawalpur districts.
Water continued to change its way from the Norja Bhutta breach to inundate the villages between Gilani Road and the M5 motorway.
Meanwhile, a man drowned and 14 people were recovered when a rescue boat carrying 15 people capsized in the Seetpur area of Alipur tehsil in Muzaffargarh district. In another incident, three members of a family drowned in Basti Arain in Alipur when they were trying to cross the standing water.
Multan district administration spokesperson Waseem Yousuf said that all flood relief camps in Multan city and Shujabad tehsil were closed as flood-affected people were returning to their homes.
He said that the administration had also started a survey to calculate losses in areas that were cleared of floodwaters.
However, he said that the relief camps in Saddar tehsil, Multan, were not closed as flood-affected people had not returned yet, and flood relief camps would not be closed in Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil until the situation returned to normal.
The teams of the urban unit would conduct the survey using the latest technology, he said, adding that the district administration officials have started the process of spraying flood-affected houses, and health department teams were tasked with using sprays to kill germs in standing waters.
In Muzaffargarh, the water level in the Chenab River has returned to normal,and water has receded from the low-lying areas. Flood-affected individuals have started returning to their homes in areas where the water has receded.
Flood-hit people are residing in 20 out of the 30 relief camps established. Some 16,650 flood-affected people are residing in relief camps, while 10,350 affected individuals are staying in tents set up on flood embankments.
PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia said the flood situation in Punjab’s rivers has returned to normal and the water flow in most rivers of Punjab has normalised.
He said that a significant decrease in water levels has been observed in flood-affected areas.
On the Sutlej River, the water flow was 104,000 cusecs at Ganda Singh Wala and 81,000 cusecs at Sulemanki.
He said that the water flow was 42,000 cusecs at the Marala point of the Chenab River, 44,000 cusecs at Khanki Headworks, 37,000 cusecs at Qadirabad, 41,000 cusecs at Head Trimmu and 133,000 cusecs at Panjnad.
On the Ravi River, the water flow was 8,000 cusecs at the Jassar point, 9,000 cusecs at Shahdara, 31,000 cusecs at Balloki and 29,000 cusecs at Sidhnai.
According to a PDMA report on losses caused by floods in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers, as many as 127 citizens have lost their lives in various incidents during the recent floods.
Over 4.755 million people of 4,700 villages have been affected due to the flood situation in the rivers. As many as 2.09m animals have been relocated to safe locations during rescue and relief activities in the affected districts.
Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javaid said that Mangla Dam was 96 per cent full and Tarbela Dam was 100pc full.
He said that the Indian Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej River was 88pc full, Pong Dam was 99pc full, while the Thien Dam was 90pc full.

Right from 15/0 Mile to 17/1 Mile, up to the first spur of Mohenjo Daro near Purani Gudd village, he inspected the LS Bund and assessed its pre- and post-flood condition, according to the superintendent engineer (SE) of Northern Dadu division, Jamil Ahmed Sangi.
The SE briefed Mr Chaudhry — a retired chief engineer having expertise in hydrology and irrigation engineering — about the condition of the LS Bund.
He also inspected the T-spur of Hakra dyke at 16/1 Mile, which was constructed in 2017, Mr Sangi said.
Expert visits damaged, weakened dykes; recommends ways to save them from erosion
He said that a consultant had earlier recommended strengthening of the shank of the T-spur by elevating its top to 20 feet. Stone pitching on both sides and construction of a stone apron was also stressed. Further­more, it was suggested that the earthen bund running across two miles should be widened to 30ft.
Mr Chaudhry suggested building an arch in 35 degrees at the upstream of the T-spur. Presently, its width is 150ft which should now be increased to 400ft by adding 250ft to its original size.
The Hakra dyke had already been declared vulnerable to erosion and, therefore, a good quantity of stone boulders had been stocked alongside the LS Bund.
Mr Sangi was of the opinion that in the next flood season, the Indus water would hit this point too. Therefore, he said, it’s mandatory to address the issue at the early stage. It’s a common phenomenon that receding floodwater could create problems, he said.
Presently floodwater is receding at Sukkur Barrage but mounting pressure on all dykes, including Moria and Abad bunds across the Northern Dadu division. The total length of these dykes in the division is 86 miles, he said.
He said mounting pressure during the peak flow a few days back had caused damage to the T-spur’s arm downstream Moria Loop Bund and attacked its entire length. However, he added, “we are vigilant about the situation and monitoring the river’s behavior“.

• Pays tribute to soldiers martyred in cross-border attacks
• Says anti-militancy plan to be placed before cabinet for firm, collective decision
PESHAWAR: With ties between the two neighbouring countries already strained, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday issued a stern message to Kabul, saying Afghanistan must decide whether it stands with Pakistan or the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“Today, I want to give a clear message to Afghanistan to choose between Pakistan and TTP,” PM Shehbaz said during a visit to Bannu, where he was accompanied by Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and Peshawar Corps Commander Lt-Gen Omer Bukhari.
The prime minister said terrorists entered Pakistan from Afghanistan and, together with the outlawed TTP, carried out attacks that martyred soldiers, brothers, sisters and ordinary citizens. He added that Pakistan was willing to maintain relations with Afghanistan, but if Kabul chose to side with and support the terrorists, then Pakistan had nothing to do with the interim Afghan government and the terrorists would be eliminated at any cost.
He said he had met the army chief and Peshawar Corps Commander, and that he had a plan which would be placed before the federal cabinet. All decisions, he stressed, would be taken collectively in the country’s interest. “The cabinet will decide and all the decisions taken in the cabinet meeting will be implemented immediately. We will not sit in peace until the militants are eliminated,” the prime minister warned.
He said it was time to take political and administrative measures to maintain peace and that decisive action was the need of the hour, adding that the entire nation wanted solid steps to restore security.
PM Shehbaz paid tribute to the officers and soldiers who had been martyred while performing their duties, saying their sacrifices were for the country’s peace. “Imagine what their parents, brothers and sisters are going through. These terrorists martyr them and take refuge in someone’s house,” he said, adding that the time had come to eliminate the militants.
The issue of militants using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks.
Differences between Pakistan and Afghanistan are primarily centered on security and border disputes. Pakistan has made terrorism its central concern in ties with Kabul, citing a sharp rise in attacks by the banned TTP and other militant groups operating from Afghanistan.
Earlier this month, Pakistan emphasised the seriousness of the threat posed to regional peace and stability by Afghanistan-based terrorist groups, calling it a common challenge that required collaborative efforts. “Groups like Fitna al Khwarij represent a common threat to the peace and stability of our region, necessitating collective action to counter their malign influence,” the Foreign Office spokesman had said at a media briefing.
During a meeting in January held in Peshawar, political leaders urged Field Marshal Asim Munir that the military engage with Afghanistan to address Pakistan’s internal security problems. The army chief, however, said the Afghan interim rulers had failed to heed repeated warnings in the past. “They don’t listen to us,” sources quoted the Field Marshal as telling politicians who had called for formal or informal dialogue with the interim Afghan government.
Earlier, during a visit by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar in April, Afghan acting premier Mullah Hasan Akhund assured that Afghanistan’s territory would not be used against its neighbours.

flash floods
tore through this hamlet, leaving a trail of destruction and trauma in their aftermath.
Still reeling from trauma of calamitous flooding, meagre compensation hampers Beshonai residents’ recovery
Still reeling from the shock, the villagers are even unsure about the number of their dead: everyone gives a figure. Some say it’s 84, while others believe 74 people died. However, many claim that several of their community members remain missing.
Besides physical destruction, the villagers also speak of mental scars inflicted by the deluge.
Jalal Ahmed, a student at the University of Buner, said they are paralysed by fear. “A large number of women from the area are still living with their relatives and refusing to come back, fearing more floods,” he added.
Hussain Shah, who lost his brother in the flood, told
Dawn
that when their local stream flooded on Aug 31, everyone in the village rushed to the nearby mountain in panic. “Women clutching their babies ran crying hysterically,” he says.
According to Dr Afsar Ali, a medical officer with the NGO Muslim Hands, at least 10pc of 200 patients examined by them suffer from anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). “After counseling, we refer them to the district headquarters hospital for psychological rehabilitation,” Dr Ali told
Dawn
.
Dr Siraj Kamal agrees with his colleague, saying the situation will get worse once the shock wears off. “Now people are too busy with reconstruction, taking care of the injured and running after aid, and when all this is over, they will be hit harder by the depression and trauma,” Dr Kamal added.
But reconstruction also has its challenges. The villagers are particularly concerned about the compensation package offered by the government. Sahibullah, a resident, calls for their relocation to some other location, fearing the villager “could never rise from its ashes”.
Traders and shopkeepers aren’t happy as well, as they try to make repairs in the Pir Baba Bazaar, one of the busiest commercial centres in the district. A thick pall of dust follows every passing car, as traders install new shutters and shelves in their shops. Al Khidmat Foundation, the welfare arm of the Jamaat Islami, has painted the exterior of the damaged shop in its own blue colour.
Syed Wahid, president of Pir Baba Bazaar traders, estimates damages to the tune of Rs30 million, which the government’s aid package hardly addressed.
“Government is treating those who lost million and those who loses are in thousands with the same yardstick,” he complained. “How, those who have lost millions, are going to get their life on track with merely Rs500,000,” he questioned, while criticising the government for its unilateral approach.
“I am president of this bazaar where over 800 shops have been affected due to the floods and the authorities did not even bother to ask me for a meeting,” he rues. For Mr Wahid, interest-free loans by the government could help restart their businesses.
Khairullah Khan, a pharmacy shop owner, lost medicines worth Rs1.3 million besides damages to his shop. “Four shutters alone cost me Rs50,000 and I have to install shelves and do other repairs,” he told
Dawn
.
As the government response remains sluggish, Mufti Fazal Ghafoor the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl has made efforts to fill the vacuum.
A large number of locals were seen heading to a hujra at some distance from the Pir Baba Bazaar, where Mufti Ghafoor distributed sewing machines, photocopiers, and equipment for welders, electricians and carpenters besides other material.
The project, being executed through donations, also includes the construction of several two-room houses for orphans and widows as well as distribution of vans and rickshaws for those who have lost their means of livelihoods.
“We are working on construction of 40 houses and have laid foundation of 12 so far in various parts of the district,” Mufti Ghafoor told
Dawn
. He said that in some instances, they have also arranged land for construction of these houses. He said that they have also distributed walkie-talkies among locals of Beshonai for easy communication, as cellphone coverage was still patchy in the area.
Following the evening prayers, a large number of party’s activists gathered at a service station in the bazaar, which they had repurposed as a relief coordination centre, reporting about their activities.Mufti Ghafoor said that with the help of 5000 seminary students, they cleaned the Pir Baba Bazaar and residential areas in the surrounding neighbourhoods.
“There are many roads still not fully restored… I would have cleared them by now if I had the machinery,” Mufti Ghafoor added.

According to the District Health Authority, 225 union council medical officers (UCMOs), 765 area in-charges (AICs), 4,731 mobile teams, 263 fixed teams, and 194 transit teams are participating in the drive to achieve the target.
The campaign is being conducted in Gujar Khan, Kahuta, Kallar Syedan, Kotli Sattian, Murree, Rawalpindi Cantt, Rawalpindi Rural, and Taxila Rural.
Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema directed the District Health Authority to achieve the target with the support of the dedicated health workforce.
“The high deployment of mobile teams will bridge gaps in rural areas, but sustaining this momentum requires addressing systemic challenges like education and access,” he said, urging citizens to cooperate with health workers.
He also called on religious scholars and parliamentarians to motivate people to vaccinate their children.
Health authority officials said two districts of Punjab, including Rawalpindi, have been moved from the red zone to the yellow zone due to their strong performance in the anti-polio campaign, which they termed an honour for the district.
Dr Cheema noted that Rawalpindi has the largest population of migrants, which is why cases of polio, dengue, and other diseases are reported in the area.
However, he added that due to the efforts of the administration, the number of cases has remained very low. He instructed that measures at the micro level should be further strengthened, warning that strict action would be taken against officials or staff found negligent or careless, as no leniency would be tolerated.
He emphasised that special attention should be given to union councils where a large number of migrants from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other adjoining areas reside, ensuring that not a single child is left without polio drops.
In a seperate development, as many as 1,800 police personnel are performing duty with 554 polio vaccination teams across the district to ensure foolproof security.
A police spokesman said Rawalpindi Police had made security arrangements for the four-day polio campaign, with around 1,800 officers and officials deployed. Security is being provided to 554 polio teams, 304 transit points and 207 fixed centers across the district.
As part of the security plan, police station mobiles, the elite squad and the Dolphin Force are also carrying out special patrol duties in different areas.
Foolproof arrangements have been made to ensure the safety of the campaign.
“Rawalpindi Police is always committed to protecting the lives and property of citizens,” the spokesman said.

imprisoned
in different countries with majority of them in the Gulf States for their alleged involvement in various crimes and illegalities; officials of the interior and foreign affairs ministries informed a Senate committee on Tuesday.
More than 13,000 of the prisoners are under trial and over 8,000 of them convicted. The meeting was told that most of the people convicted were involved in smuggling and that 65 per cent cases were drug related.  The Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development held its meeting in Parliament House with Senator Zeeshan Khanzada in the chair.
Senator Khanzada noted the urgency of the situation and stressed institutional coordination. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the committee that after its instructions it was decided to form an inter-ministerial committee on prisoners, which will include ambassadors and officials from relevant ministries. Letters have already been sent to all Pakistani embassies and missions worldwide.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the initiative will proceed in phases: First, meetings will be arranged with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and then engagement with Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia and lastly consultations with be held with the United Kingdom and European Union countries.
Community welfare attachés begin visiting prisons to meet Pakistani detainees, say officials
The committee was informed that community welfare attachés have begun visiting prisons abroad to meet Pakistani detainees.
However, Senator Nasir Butt rejected such claims and said, “No one visits Pakistanis imprisoned in jails.” Officials clarified that such visits have only recently started.
Chairman Khanzada directed the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis to present a full report on the funds allocated for legal and welfare support to imprisoned Pakistanis in the next meeting. This is the first initiative for details of funds and expenditure and it must be provided, he emphasised.
On migration issues, officials said there were 294 legal avenues for Pakistanis to travel to European Union countries, with student visas given priority. They noted that nearly 50 per cent of Pakistanis going to Italy travel legally while 50 per cent resort to illegal routes.
The committee expressed grave concern over reports that many citizens pay as much as Rs7 million to leave Pakistan illegally.
The committee dismissed recent claims about 40,000 Pakistani pilgrims disappearing in Iraq, declaring the matter a myth.
Senator Raja Nasir Abbas informed the committee that he personally raised the issue with the Iraqi leadership.
“I met the Prime Minister of Iraq, and he called it wrong. I also spoke to the Minister of Religious Affairs of Pakistan, who confirmed it was a mistake,” Senator Abbas clarified.
Officials from the Ministry of Interior briefed the committee that only 27 Pakistanis were caught in Iraq, while a total of 30 out of 81 Pakistanis remain under trial.
Senator Raja Nasir Abbas criticised the treatment of Pakistani citizens abroad. The passports of Pakistanis are kept at airports in various countries including Iraq. This is a great insult to Pakistani citizens, and the government must take notice. Ministry officials assured him the matter would be taken up at the highest level.

The development came during a session chaired by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati.
The draft law moved by law minister Aftab Alam Afridi was unanimously passed by the house after the incorporation of amendments suggested by some opposition members.
Under the law, the climate action board will “plan, oversee and execute all climate-related initiatives, streamline decision-making and synergise cross-sector efforts to address climate risks faced by the province and for matters connected there with and incidental thereto”.
Demands release of Imran’s detained nephews, action against those ‘misusing powers’
The draft bill says the climate action or climate initiatives mean any programmes, projects or activities meant to mitigate climate change and the risks associated therewith, adapt to climate change, support climate change research and promote awareness about the climate change with the objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, encourage low-carbon economy, enhance climate change resilience and promote sustainable development.
Section 3 of the bill states that there will be the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Climate Action Board to coordinate and oversee climate strategies across departments to ensure harmonisation of efforts. The board will be administratively and functionally independent, while the government will make best efforts to promote, enhance and maintain the board’s independence.
The board will have the authority to develop, review, amend and oversee the execution of climate policies and action plans for the province; advise government on climate policies, commitments and strategies; conduct and maintain provincial greenhouse gas inventories and establish emissions baselines, and conduct, promote and oversee research on mitigation, adaptation and climate finance.
The board will also be responsible for climate tagging of all schemes in the Annual Development Programme for alignment with climate goals, mobilising financial resources for climate action and establish, operate and maintain the dedicated Climate Action Board Fund, and coordinating and pitching provincial projects for international climate financing like Green Climate Finance, Climate Investment Finance and Global Environment Facility.
It will also facilitate participation in carbon markets, support the generation of carbon credits, establish and implement carbon pricing mechanisms to encourage low-carbon development, monitor and evaluate the implementation and progress of climate action programmes and projects. Also, the board will conduct public awareness campaigns on climate change, promote environmental sustainability, engage with stakeholders, including communities, industries and civil society, and ensure community resilience to climate change, including systems for adoptive and shock responsive social protection.
The additional chief secretary (planning and development) will be the chairperson of the board, while its members include secretaries of the finance, law, climate change, energy and powers, transport, local government departments, four nominees from the private sector at least one woman and two members of the provincial assembly to be nominated by the speaker.
Statement of object and reasons for the bill said KP
faced
growing climate-related threats, such as extreme weather, glacial melt and deforestation, which endangered lives, ecosystem and economic stability. However, the absence of a centralised institutional mechanism has limited its ability to respond effectively.
The house also approved the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Aasan Karobar Bill, 2025, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tourism (Amendment) Bill, 2025.
The lawmakers also adopted a resolution demanding the release of Shershah Khan and Shahraiz Khan, the nephews of PTI founder Imran Khan.
The resolution, moved by PTI MPA Asif Khan Mehsud, also called for the immediate withdrawal of “false and vindictive charges” against Shershah and Shahraiz.
It also demanded accountability of all those “misusing power” and urged authorities to ensure such acts are not repeated.
The resolution said no citizen should be subjected to arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention or political victimisation.
The chair later adjourned the session until next Friday.

urban flooding
in Gujrat city.
Almost all the main roads, government offices and residential and commercial areas were submerged with the water for the third consecutive day. After heavy rains for at least 27 hours from Sept 2 to 4, the city could not get rid of the floodwater. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz also inspected the situation during her visit to the city on Friday.
A senior official of land revenue department who has been overseeing the plugging of the water flow from Daulat Nagar, a small town near Kharian-Sambrial motorway route for the last three days, told
Dawn
the department’s initial inquiry about the massive water flow towards the city found that the traditional flow of water of the some storm water channels had been disturbed due to the construction work on the motorway.
He added this was only the second time in the two years that the floodwater of storm water channels had caused the massive urban flooding, which had never happened before in the history of Gujrat.
“However this year, the intensity of water flow exceeded 10 times, making it almost impossible to the local administration to stop the massive inflow whereas the capacity of the existing skeleton of sewerage and drainage system of the city is not made to cater to such a huge flooding water,” the official said on condition of not to be named.
Revenue dept’s inquiry finds natural flow of storm water channels was disturbed
He said some temporary solutions were tried to stop the flow but they were not enough to block that water coming from at least 20 to 25 kilometers away from the city. He said that had there been alternate solutions for the water flows, such a massive flooding could have been averted as a large population of the city and its surrounding rural populations had suffered huge losses.
Some residents of Shahpur and Fatehpur have told
Dawn
that some influential figures had also disturbed the water flow with the illegal encroachments and construction activities on the route of water flow in the vicinity.
Meanwhile, the residents of different city areas remained besieged by the flood water that had become stagnant.
The officials of Rescue 1122, district administration, police and volunteers of Al-Khidmat Foundation and other organisations, are continuing their operations to evacuate the stranded people from their houses through boats, tractor-trolleys and other vehicles. Food was also distributed by the local administration and the NGOs in the city areas as the people faced shortage of food, milk and drinking water.
CM Maryam Nawaz along with Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman and Gujrat Deputy Commissioner Nurulain Qureshi visited Fawara Chowk, one of the worst affected localities in the heart of the Gujrat city. The CM inspected the gravity of the situation and directed the authorities concerned to use all kind of resources to clear the urban flooding.
Punjab secretary housing Noorul Amin Mengal, secretary communication and works department C&W, director general Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Irfan Ali Kathia and other senior officials spent a busy day in Gujrat and monitored the efforts to block the water flow towards the city.
Major diversions have been made near Loraiy Chowk, Nathowal and Malhu Khokhar.
However, the water flow towards the city has started receding but official sources said that it might take another couple of days to clear the water from the city.

Ms Sultana said currently, the region didn’t have any centres with integrated services like psychological counseling, legal aid, crisis intervention, helpline services and family mediation, increasing the vulnerability of people to suicide.
She said the centre would provide professional mental health counselling and psychological support to women and youth, and legal assistance and guidance to victims of domestic violence and sexual violence.
“We will establish a 24/7 helpline for immediate assistance and crisis intervention, conduct awareness campaigns to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and sexual violence, offer vocational training and non-timber forest products-based enterprise programmes for livelihood improvement, and provide Islamic and general counseling, family mediation, and conflict resolution services,” she said.
The activist said the proposed services would also include psychological counseling and therapy, legal assistance and support, emergency services, vocational training and livelihood development, awareness and advocacy programmes.
She said women and youth facing mental health challenges or violence violence, people at risk of suicide and families facing conflict and domestic stress would benefit from the centre.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942559/punjabs-wheat-restrictions-trigger-domino-effect,Punjab’s wheat restrictions trigger domino effect - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"• Despite official denials, checkpoints set up at province’s exit points to curtail movement
• Flour prices in KP jump 68pc; 20kg bag hits Rs2,800
• KP Assembly passes unanimous resolution against Punjab’s move
LAHORE: Punjab’s unannounced
ban
on the interprovincial movement of wheat has ignited a new crisis, causing a severe flour shortage and soaring prices in other provinces.
The move has drawn sharp
criticism
from politicians and flour millers who argue it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement.
While Punjab officials
de­n­ied
a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. Critics, however, argued that these mea­sures are against the spirit of a deregulated market.
The ban has been met with strong condemnation from other provinces, particularly Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa and Sindh, which heavily depend on Punj­ab’s wheat supply.
The All-Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA) has labelled the policy unconstitutional, citing Article 151 of the Constit­ution, which guarantees the freedom of trade and commerce across the country.
According to Riazullah Khan, chairman of the Punjab Flour Mills Associa­tion, checkpoints at the province’s exit points are bloc­king the transport of wheat and flour to other regions. He said that these actions run counter to the deregulation policy, which promised unrestricted trade and movement of wheat.
As a result of the restrictions, flour prices have skyrocketed in provinces like KP, where a 20kg bag of flour is now selling for up to Rs2,800, compared to around Rs1,800 in Punjab. This has placed an unbearable burden on low-income families already struggling with inflation.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi publicly condemned the ban, calling it a “blatant violation of Article 151” and a “serious breach of national unity”. The KP Assembly has also adopted a unanimous resolution denouncing Punjab’s restrictions on wheat supply, citing a 68 per cent hike in flour prices in the province.
It is not a new phenomenon but a recurring issue that resurfaces whenever there is a shortage of wheat, often caused by natural disasters such as floods or by low production due to inadequate or poor-quality farm inputs, particularly urea and DAP fertilisers. The country witnessed the same issue in 2020, 2022 and 2023.
The problem deepened when Punjab, which traditionally procured and stocked more than four million tonnes each harvest to stabilise prices and ensure year-round availability of grain, withdrew from this role under international agreements.
Govt stance vs market realities
Punjab officials maintained that the restrictions are a necessary measure to ensure food security within the province and to combat hoarding and smuggling.
They argued that preventing wheat from being diverted to feed mills or sold to other provinces at inflated prices is essential for ensuring a stable supply for local consumers.
They also pointed to the National Finance Commission award, under which each province is responsible for its own food security and should not blame other federating units for shortages.
However, millers and market analysts argued that this policy is counterproductive. They contended that the ban creates an artificial shortage, leading to market instability and driving up prices nationwide.
The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) has consistently advocated for a deregulated wheat market, arguing that bans on interprovincial movement only create inefficiency and corruption.
Majid Abdullah, president of the Progressive Flour Millers Group, warned that if administrative measures to regulate the so-called deregulated market continue, the private sector will be reluctant to invest in the wheat sector next season.
This could force the government to import grain at much higher rates than what is available locally. Abdullah highlighted the irony of the situation, noting that Punjab authorities had previously encouraged private investment, even offering bank loans for the purpose of purchasing large quantities of grain during harvest season.
He added that without proper legal protection, the deregulation process remains uncertain and vulnerable to being reversed by a future government, which could make private investment in storage facilities worthless.
“Stability of the market needs a consistent, thorough policy protected by a proper piece of legislation,” Mr Abdullah stated.
Farmers’ woes
The ban also has a ripple effect on farmers. While the government aims to secure a stable price for consumers, its actions are seen as a disincentive for farmers.
They may choose to plant other crops in the upcoming sowing season if they cannot get a fair price for their wheat, which could lead to a significant decline in domestic production and force the country to rely on costly imports.
Mr Abdullah cautioned that administrative efforts to control prices, especially with the next sowing season approaching, will discourage farmers who are already hesitant to plant wheat after failing to get good prices for their produce in the last two seasons.
The situation underscores a deep-seated tension between the government’s desire to control prices for the public and the free-market principles essential for a healthy agricultural economy.
The federal government, under pressure from affected provinces, is now being urged to intervene and restore the free movement of wheat to avert a full-blown food crisis.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944590/action-committee-azad-kashmir-government-talks-collapse,"Action committee, Azad Kashmir government talks collapse - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","MUZAFFARABAD: Almost 13 hours of
negotiations
between the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC), the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government and two federal ministers collapsed early Thursday morning, after a deadlock emerged over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan based refugees from Indian occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
The JKJAAC negotiators walked out of the talks, declaring them “incomplete and inconclusive” and vowing that the
lockdown
would be observed with full force.
Speaking to reporters afterwards, federal ministers Engr Ameer Muqam and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry maintained that the dialogue had taken place in a “very positive and pleasant atmosphere,” and that all practicable demands of the action committee falling within the jurisdiction of the AJK and federal governments had been accepted.
“However, issues that require constitutional amendments or subordinate legislation by the Parliament (Legislative Assembly) cannot be decided by a few people in a closed room. That is why the negotiations ended without results,” the ministers remarked.
They stressed that Islamabad had made efforts to ensure that AJK citizens not only enjoyed all fundamental rights but also their protection, pointing to subsidies on flour and electricity.
“Nowhere in Pakistan do people get electricity at Rs3 per unit or flour at Rs50 per kilo. These concessions are extended only to the people of AJK in recognition of their sacrifices,” they asserted.
The ministers said progress had been made on pending matters related to the December 8 agreement and on the JKJAAC’s 38-point charter of demands, until the negotiating team “suddenly created a deadlock” by pressing for abolition of elite perks and the 12 refugee seats.
“Even then we made sincere efforts to resolve matters, but the committee abruptly chose to walk away, which clearly shows they have some other agenda,” Mr Chaudhry alleged.
He nonetheless added that the government’s “doors for dialogue are still open” and urged the JKJAAC to “realise its national and collective responsibilities.”
Confirming the breakdown, JKJAAC core member Shaukat Nawaz Mir told the media that members had unanimously agreed that talks could not be completed without scrapping elite privileges and refugee seats.
“Therefore, after mutual consultation, we announced to end the negotiations,” he said.
Still, he acknowledged progress on several issues and expressed satisfaction with the attitude of the federal ministers and the official team.
The talks had begun around 4:30pm Wednesday after the arrival of the JKJAAC negotiators in Muzaffarabad, with breaks for prayers and meals. From the AJK government’s ministerial team, minister for higher education Zafar Iqbal Malik withdrew from the process at the very outset on the demand of the JKJAAC, while Chaudhry Qasim Majeed and Sardar Amir Altaf also stayed away from later rounds.
However, Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore and Deevan Ali Chughtai remained in the committee room with the federal ministers until the end, alongside the AJK chief secretary Khushal Khan and inspector general of police Rana Abdul Jabbar.
After the talks ended, JKJAAC negotiators left the venue with a large number of supporters, chanting slogans. The federal ministers left for Islamabad after noon on Thursday.
Meanwhile, videos circulating on social media before dawn showed large contingents of security forces arriving in Muzaffarabad in around 85 vehicles, fuelling speculation and unease among JKJAAC supporters and citizens.
Late on Thursday night, Shaukat Nawaz Mir, JKJAAC core committee member from Muzaffarabad, addressed a large gathering at the city’s iconic Lal Chowk in Upper Adda to brief people on the negotiation process.
He thanked the federal government for realising the gravity of the situation in AJK and detailing two honourable cabinet members to facilitate the negotiation process.
“Ours is not a political platform. Those who talk sense are bound to win our appreciation, while those who criticise us cannot escape our ire,” he said.
Touching upon the issue of 12 refugee seats, he alleged that they had been used to usurp the rights of the people living within AJK.
“It is unjust to link these seats with the Kashmir freedom movement,” he said, and added: “We urge the federal government and our institutions not to stand behind what is wrong or those who are in the wrong.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945330/dwindling-firefly-populations-leave-lahore-evenings-drab,Dwindling firefly populations leave Lahore evenings drab - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: The population of fireflies, which used to enchant Lahorites with their bio-luminescent display during humid summer evenings, has witnessed a dramatic decline in Lahore, like many other urban centres worldwide, over the past few  decades, raising concerns about their local extinction.
These soft-bodied beetles from the Lampyridae family, glow to attract mates, creating a natural spectacle like stars on the ground.
While no formal warning about fireflies’ extinction has been issued so far for Lahore, specifically, scientific observations and broader South Asian trends point to a severe reduction—potentially over 70pc in similar regions—driven by human activity, Deputy Chief Wildlife Rangers Dr Ghulam Rasool told
Dawn
on Sunday.
Mr Rasool says that older Lahore residents often recall abundant fireflies in gardens, parks like Jallo Park, and along canals in the 1980s and 1990s. They were so abundant that children would collect them in glass jars as “living lanterns”, as described in cultural narratives from Karachi. On rural outskirts or semi-urban spots, evenings used to lit up with these tiny flickering lights of nature, he adds.
He notes that firefly sightings are now sporadic and confined to less urbanised fringes, such as suburban lawns or areas near water bodies like the river Ravi or canals. A 2024 Reddit thread highlighted a Lahore resident spotting fireflies in his yard after years of absence, but many locals report they have not seen these glowing insects at all in the central areas. Their number has also plummeted in Punjab’s rural areas, with some experts warn of a “gradual extinction” due to habitat loss.
Rasool is of the view that Pakistan’s firefly hot spots like, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Murree, are also losing their populations, with urbanisation cited as the primary culprit. A 2025 nationwide census in India revealed a 76pc drop in the firefly counts in one year, from over 25,000 to just 6,139 individuals, signaling a regional crisis.
Globally, the IUCN estimates 20pc of the assessed firefly species (about 30 out of 150) face extinction risks, with South Asian species particularly data-deficient but vulnerable.
Lahore’s rapid urbanisation — now a metropolis of over 13 million—has amplified the threats that disrupt fireflies’ entire lifecycle (from glowing larvae in moist soil to adults needing dark, vegetated mating grounds).For instance, fireflies thrive in humid, low-light environments, but Lahore’s concrete jungle and 24/7 illumination create a “death trap” for them.
No species is officially listed as extinct locally, but populations may have retreated to isolated pockets. The IUCN’s Firefly Specialist Group warns that without intervention, urban fireflies could vanish within a generation, as seen in parts of Europe and India. In Pakistan, experts like Dr Maqsood Shah from the University of Agriculture, Peshawar, terms fireflies an “environmental indicators”, saying their absence signals broader ecosystem collapse.
He suggests that the plan to establish a firefly breeding centre at Jallo Park, proposed years ago, could be revived. He says that butterfly houses in Lahore already promote insect conservation.”Firefly tourism” in regions like rural areas of Punjab and Kaghan valley can draw visitors and fund habitat protection, he suggests and call for expanding it to Lahore’s outskirts. Dr Shah says that fireflies have not left Lahore entirely, but their magic is dimming.
“By addressing the threats, we can ensure that our future generations witness the firefly dance again. If you’re in Lahore, head to a dark, green spot this monsoon season; you may still catch a glimpse,” he concluded.

flo­od-hit areas
and transport food and other life-saving equipment to people stranded in floodwaters.
The home department conducted a test run of the drone on Wednesday and rescued a man in a mock exercise in Lahore.
Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi told
Dawn
that the drone having the capacity to lift people or relief items up to 100kg had been dispatched to Multan after a test run in Lahore. “Another drone with a capacity to car­­ry up to 200kg has been acquired from Kar­achi and is expected to reach Multan on Thursday,” he said.
The Punjab governm­e­­nt has already been using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and quadcopters to identify citizens trap­ped in floodwaters before sending boats to the survivors.
Navy deploys hovercraft to rescue people, livestock stranded in Sindh districts
Dr Qazi said the drones were equipped with powerful cameras and were being sent on surveillance flights to identify the worst-hit areas, adding the floods had played havoc in the province. “Where there is an emergency and areas have become inaccessible for routine operations thr­ough boats, these drones will airlift people to save lives,” he added.
A department spokesman said the secretary had inst­ructed them to acquire 10 more drones for rescue and relief operations.
Separately, the Pakis­tan Navy has deployed hovercraft in the flood-af­fected districts of Kash­more, Ghotki, Sukkur and Shikarpur in Sindh.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, a spokesperson said the hovercraft were capable of operating across land, water and swampy areas. “In these districts, 4,335 people and over 125 livestock have been successfully evacuated,” the statement said.
The teams also transferred household belongings and fertiliser stocks.

• Police fire tear gas to disperse protesters in various localities; dozens rounded up across the province
• Markets stay shut; trade with Iran, Afghanistan suspended due to roadblocks; only airport, railway station operational
QUETTA: Opposition leaders vowed to continue holding protests across Baloc­histan after police
arrested
260 people on Monday for alleged violent demo­n­s­trations and violation of
Section 144
.
The arrests came as Quetta and other parts of the province were brought to a virtual standstill as a result of a strike —
announced
by opposition parties to protest a recent
suicide bombing
, which claimed over a dozen lives.
Life across the province was also disrupted and due to road blocks, Balochistan remained cut off from the rest of the country, barring rail and aerial routes.
Clashes were also reported between protesters and the police. A senior police official was also taken to hospital with bullet injuries, officials said.
Workers and supporters of the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan alliance blocked all national highways at different entry points, putting up barricades and big boulders in the morning to block all types of traffic. Transporters’ associations had already announced support for their protest.
Likewise, trade activities between Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran were suspended due to the strike. Not a single truck or other vehicle crossed into the border towns of Chaman and Taftan due to the blockade on highways linking Balochistan with Afghanistan and Iran.
The airport and rail services, however, remained operational under the watchful eye of security personnel.
Besides roads and trade, businesses also remained shut and the supporters of the opposition parties patrolled the business hubs of the provincial capital, seemingly to enforce the strike.
Clashes erupted in the areas of Sariab, Airport Road, Pashtunabad, Nawa Killi, and Jinnah Road when police attempted to remove blockades from main roads.
Police removed the hurdles and did not allow the alliance workers to block intra-city roads.
The protesters, however, managed to block the Western and Eastern bypasses for a brief period, but police dispersed them by firing tear gas.
On Airport Road too, police fired in the air to disperse protesters who were blocking the road, while clashes were also reported from Sariab Road.
SSP Mohammad Baloch told
Dawn
that those detained had been sent to the district jail.
PkMAP Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal, ex-MNA Abdul Qahar Wadan, BNP-Mengal leader Mir Naseer Ahmed Shahwani and others were also arrested by the police.
Private educational institutions, including schools and colleges, remained closed due to the protest.
However, government-run educational institutions and offices remained open, but very few employees could reach the secretariat and other offices due to low traffic.
60 arrested across province
In other parts of the province, over 60 people were arrested for violating Section 144, blocking the highways, and clashing with the security forces. The wheel-jam and shutter-down strike was also observed in Loralai, Zhob, Sibi. Nasirabad, Khuzdar, Kalat, Harnai, Mastung, Hub Bela, Kharan, Noshki, Qila Saifullah, Turbat, Panjgur, Gwadar, Dera Murad Jamali and other towns and cities. “Around 60 people were arrested in these towns,” said officials.
In KP, the opposition parties, as well as the ruling PTI, also organised demonstrations across the province.
The strike call was given by PkMAP, BNP, the PTI, the ANP, the National Party, and the MWM at a joint presser last week to protest the Sept 2 suicide bombing.
Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, former senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai remained unhurt in the attack as they had left just a few minutes before.
Press conference
Addressing the media at the Quetta Press Club on Monday evening, PkMAP’s Lala Abdul Rauf, BNP’s Sajid Tareen Advocate, ANP’s Asghar Achakzai, National Party’s Aslam Baloch, Jamaat-e-Islami’s Zahid Akhtar, and PTI’s Dawood Shah Achakzai condemned what they called the government’s attempts to sabotage their strike. They decried baton charge, tear gas shelling, and mass arrests of peaceful protesters and announced a plan to hold more protest rallies.
The leaders announced that protests will be held on Sept 11 in front of press clubs across Balochistan, while a meeting of senior leaders has been scheduled for Sept 13 to finalise the alliance’s future course of action. They warned that if political workers and leaders detained across the province were not released, a tougher line of action would be announced at the Sept 13 meeting.
Former governor Malik Abdul Wali Kakar, Akhtar Hussain Langove, Shafqaat Langove, Jameel Mashwani, Abdul Hameed Mansoori, Mir Ghulam Nabi Marri, Kabir Afghan, and Ismatullah were also present at the press conference.

LAHORE: Punjab remains in the grip of a worsening
flood crisis
, as the Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers surge to “exceptionally high” levels, threatening vast swathes of land, while the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has warned of more torrential rain, which could lead to urban flooding across Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat.
The water level in the Punjab’s rivers is expected to rise further after the High Commission of India
informed
Pakistan of incoming floodwater from the Harike and Ferozepur headworks, according to the Pakistan Commission for Indus Water.
“Harike and Ferozpur along the Sutlej in India are at high flood level as of 8am on Sept 1, which will affect the water levels in the respective downstream districts,” says an advisory released by the PDMA.
Northern India, particularly in the catchment areas of rivers that flow into Pakistan, has been experiencing heavy and continuous rainfall in recent weeks. According to Indian forecasts, the next 36 hours will be critical in Uttrakhand, Himachal, Haryana, and Punjab, as there are chances of heavy rainfall in these areas.
As of 1am on Tuesday, the Chenab at Trimmu recorded a massive and steady outflow of 532,498 cusecs, classified as a “very high” flood. A dangerous surge is moving towards Head Trimmu, and water levels are expected to swell to nearly 700,000 cusecs.
At the same time, the Ravi River is also at a “very high” flood level at Balloki Headworks with 144,675 cusecs, while Sidhnai Headworks is also in a similar state, recording 105,604 cusecs and rising.
The Sutlej River continues to pose a severe threat at Ganda Singh Wala, maintaining an “exceptionally high” flood with steady outflows of 253,068 cusecs. The situation is projected to worsen, with approximately one million cusecs of water expected to converge at Panjnad between Sept 4 and 5.
The provincial government, which has termed this its “largest rescue and relief operation,” is now shifting its focus south.
A senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity told Dawn, “The water has passed the major central Punjab population centres, but the true test of our infrastructure and preparedness is now at Panjnad and the areas beyond. We are monitoring it on a minute-by-minute basis.”
On Monday, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that various cities were on high alert for the next 24 to 48 hours, including Jhang, Sahiwal, Toba Tek Singh, Okara, Multan, Pak­pattan, Bahawal­nagar, Vehari and Bahawalpur.
Speaking at a press conference in Lahore, she said the water released by India had created ‘extraordinary circumstances’. “To meet those circumstances, there were extraordinary preparations and readiness by Punjab’s authorities, rescue teams, and civil defence in times of emergency,” she added.
‘Punjab’s worst flood ever’
Addressing another press conference, PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathia said 41 people have lost their lives in the floods, while eight have been injured.
He warned that Punjab is facing the biggest flood in its history, with the ninth spell of the monsoon predicted to bring more rain over the next two days.
He added that no new flood surge had entered Head Marala, but after the rains, the water in Leh Nullah at Katariyyan has reached up to 19 feet.
Mr Kathia said that there is no threat to Trimmu Headworks and noted that water from the Chenab would enter Multan within the next 12 hours, where it would merge with floodwaters from the Ravi.
He warned that a breach may have to be made at Safura on Monday night due to the major surge at Sidhnai, with arrangements already completed. He said the breach will affect 14 villages and 17,000 acres.
He added that a flood surge of 600,000 to 650,000 cusecs was expected at Head Muhammad Wala on Tuesday (today). An important meeting regarding Head Muhammad Wala had already been held in Multan and key decisions taken. If breaching occurs there, 16 revenue estates (mouzas) will be affected.
The PDMA chief predicted that floodwaters would accumulate at Panjnad on September 5, though at lower levels than earlier estimates. He said water from the Sutlej was currently moving towards Sulemanki and Head Islam.
He claimed that timely decisions had saved many lives. He said that Rescue 1122 was conducting the largest rescue operation in its history, with 3,100 villages and 2,900 revenue estates affected across Punjab.
So far, more than 2.4 million people have been affected, with over 900,000 people and 600,000 animals relocated to safe areas. Relief efforts include 390 camps and tent cities, while the Livestock Department is arranging fodder and feed for animals.
Mr Kathia also noted that India had only provided information regarding the Sutlej, with no details shared about any other river surges.
He further said that there is no longer any expectation of a major surge at Marala, however, rainwater will still come.
Earlier, Multan Com­missioner Aamir Karim Khan said over 450,267 people and 468,284 livestock had been relocated to safer places.
He said that a flood surge of nearly 800,000 cusecs in the Chenab was expected to pass through Multan between Monday and Tuesday night.
A decision regarding possible breaching at Sher Shah and Head Muhammad Wala would be made based on the water situation.
Urban flooding alert
Meanwhile, PDMA on Monday issued alert about urban flooding in Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat due to heavy rainfall expected in the next 72 hours.
According to an advisory, Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat may face urban flooding in the next 72 hours as parts of Punjab are set to receive rainfall.
“A well-marked monsoon low is present over southwest Haryana and adjoining areas, while a strong trough of a westerly wave lies over the northern parts of the country.”
It forecasted “widespread heavy to very heavy rainfall, along with torrential downpours, at scattered places over the upper catchments of the Sutlej, Beas (upstream of Ganda Singh Wala), Ravi, and Chenab rivers, along with their tributaries and nullahs, as well as in Lahore and Gujranwala divisions, from Sept 1 to 3.”
In light of the situation, the PDMA warned of rising river flows, forecasting “very high” to “exceptionally high” floods in the Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab. District authorities have been directed to take precautionary measures, prepare for urban flooding, and disseminate information among the public.

Several neighbourhoods of Peshawar were flooded.
Provincial Disaster Management Authority said two people were killed in Khyber tribal district, while Buner and Tank districts reported one death each in roof collapse and mudslide incidents.
Several parts of the provincial capital, including Hayatabad, Regi and Warsak Road, were inundated due to flooding in the Budhni nullah.
Spokesman for Rescue 1122 Bilal Ahmad Faizi told
Dawn
that rescue workers evacuated at least 200 people from those areas.
Several Peshawar neighbourhoods flooded
He said that last night’s rain caused floodwaters to enter houses in Arbab Cottages Colony, Madina Colony, Regi Model Town and the surroundings of Budhni Bridge, leaving many families stranded.
Mr Faizi said Rescue 1122 teams safely evacuated women, children and elderly persons in special boats.
He said children stranded in a school bus, families trapped in their homes and people stuck in flooded streets were also rescued.
Residents said basements in most houses in those areas were inundated.
Also, Peshawar’s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) services remained suspended for several hours due to inundation of the corridor.
TransPeshawar, the operator of the mass transit, said in a statement that all BRT services had been suspended due to the inundation of corridor and feeder routes. The bus service on the main corridor was restored in the afternoon.
In Khyber tribal district, 12 houses were damaged, while several electricity poles were uprooted.
The flash floods washed away link roads in several localities of Landi Kotal and Jamrud.
Police and Rescue 1122 personnel said most houses were damaged in Malagori sub-tehsil of Jamrud as floodwater entered several rooms. Over a dozen electricity poles were also uprooted.
In Landi Kotal, floodwaters damaged Dargai-Kam Shalman Road. Traffic to the Sheen Pokharea in Loe Shalman was also suspended due to landslides.
The rainwater inundated the children’s park adjacent to Hamza Baba’s mausoleum, with several houses suffering damage in Peero Khel, Angor Bagh and Ugda Darra localities.
The Afghan families bound for their country were seen stranded on roadsides, with no proper shelter to protect them from heavy rainfall.
The rain also lashed several parts of Mohmand tribal district. Flash floods in upper parts of the district caused widespread destruction in Safi, Baizai and Khewazai subdivisions.
Khakh Bazaar in Safi tehsil was the worst-hit area, with dozens of shops, warehouses and factories swept away or badly damaged by the deluge, according to assistant commissioner Usman Hamza.
Meanwhile, Baizai sub-division also received heavy rain, affecting Mazari Chena, Lakhkar Kalay, Koda Khel, Spinky Tangi and Khwreena areas in Baizai tehsil along with Kong, Khadikhel, Kaka Kor and Babi Kore in Khewazai tehsil.
Assistant commissioner of Baizai Noman Hafeez and tehsildar went to those areas to monitor the situation.
Mr Hafeez said two arteries in Khewazai, including Kung Village Road and Attokhel-Atta Bazar Road, were severely damaged by floodwaters, while Kuzo Kass bridge was washed away by floodwaters. An 11KV electricity transmission line was destroyed in Soor Daag village of Khewazai.
Floodwaters also inundated residential areas in Safi, Khewaizai and neighbouring Michnai, Prachavi bazaar, Kado Koor and Shaheed Banda localities.
Multiple houses collapsed or were damaged, while crops were ruined. Key roads and a bridge in Khewazai were washed away, hampering rescue and relief efforts.
In the Lower South Waziristan tribal district, torrential rains triggered landslides at several points of the Wana-Gomal Zam Road near Sheen Kai, bringing traffic to a halt.
Additional deputy commissioner Khalid Qayyum said a debris clearance operation was launched with the help of heavy machinery.
Officials of the district administration said the road closure caused long queues of vehicles on both sides, with patients and commuters suffering the most.
The transporters union said traffic was temporarily diverted to the Wana-Jandola route to the people’s misery.
Heavy rainfall was also reported in Kohat, Orakzai and several other parts of the province. The PMD said Kakul recorded 38mm of rainfall, Upper Dir 27, Saidu Sharif 20, Peshawar nine and Takhtbai seven.

Sources in education department told this scribe that after reconstruction of more than 50 per cent militancy-affected schools in Bara with the financial assistance of China, about 27 prefabricated classrooms of the total 52 such rooms as replacement for the damaged classrooms were lying unused.
These prefabricated classrooms were provided by Sarhad Rural Support Programme to damaged and destroyed schools of Bara after the return of internally displaced families in 2015-16.
Sources said that at least two prefabricated classrooms in Shalobar area of Bara were uprooted and rendered useless during the windstorm and torrential rains on August 30 while in some other localities the watchmen of schools refused to shoulder responsibility of looking after those rooms after reconstruction of the main buildings where those watchmen were posted.
Summary of education dept shows 24 damaged schools in the district
Sipah Khidmat-i-Khalq Organisation, a Bara based welfare body, had early this year floated a request for provision of some of these prefabricated classrooms to five community primary schools in upper Bara of Tirah valley as none of these informal schools has a formal building since their creation in September 2023.
The education department is yet to establish a formal school in entire upper Bara, comprising a population of more than 7,000 and majority of displaced families had already returned in 2022.
In response, officials argued that leftover prefabricated classrooms could be allocated only to formal schools operating under the department that were either fully damaged or had excess enrolment of students, as per rules and regulations.
Sources in Bara said that the matter was later referred to district administration as all the five informal schools in upper Bara were operating under the open sky with local teacher sending their students early to their homes in bad weather conditions.
The district administration after consultations with education department constituted a committee to propose judicious utilisation of leftover prefabricated classrooms and devise a mechanism for their allocation to community schools in upper Bara.
The committee, in its letter sent to deputy commissioner in August, expressed inability to resolve the issue owing to undue interference by parliamentarians of Bara and ‘some external factors beyond their control’.
Sources said that MNA Iqbal Afridi in a letter dated August 15 told education department that no prefabricated classroom should be shifted from any school without his prior knowledge and consent.
On the other hand, MPA Suhail Afridi is demanding that some of the prefabricated classrooms should be installed in damaged or overcrowded schools in his Jarumd constituency.
A summary of education department showed that there were 24 damaged schools in the district while nine more needed urgent repair. Residents of upper Bara, however, insisted that no new enrolment of their children was conducted since September 2023 owing to absence of formal schools.
They said that the future of 450 students currently studying in five community schools with one teacher each in every school was also in danger as they would soon complete their primary level education with no access to middle grade schooling and proper school buildings.
Haji Waak Khan, a resident of upper Bara where he had established one of the community schools, said that provision of prefabricated classrooms would greatly benefit their children.
He said that local customs and traditions too were not in favour of a co-education system beyond primary level and their girls would continue studies only if education department provided them with better facilities, including prefabricated classrooms.

Judicial Magistrate (East) Yusra Ashfaq found Abdullah Saleem guilty of offences under Sections 20 (dignity of natural person), 21 (modesty of natural person and minor) and 24 (cyberstalking) of the
Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act
(Peca) 2016, and awarded him two years’ imprisonment on each count.
“It is clear that the prosecution has successfully proven the charge against the accused. The prosecution has demonstrated that the accused tarnished the dignity of the complainant and her family, violated the complaint’s modesty, display videos without her consent, and displayed them publicly,” the court observed.
Explaining the motive of the accused, the court noted that the evidence reflected his frustration and resentment over the refusal of a formal engagement with the complainant due to his anger issues.
Magistrate finds him guilty of offences of cyberstalking, etc under Peca
The court further observed that the accused had threatened the complainant and started harassing her by creating fake social media accounts and misusing them to transmit her photographs with the intent to take revenge and damage her honour and reputation.
According to state prosecutor Sheraz Rajpar, the complainant stated in her testimony that she had had a friendship with the accused, which eventually ended due to his inappropriate behaviour. Later, the accused resorted to creating fake Facebook accounts in the complainant’s name and sharing her personal photos to blackmail her and her family.
The complainant deposed that the “accused admitted to being behind those accounts and threatened her that she would never be able to marry anyone else, even going so far as to say he would force her to commit suicide”, the prosecutor added.
During the trial, prosecutor Sheraz argued that the complainant’s testimony was corroborated by the verification report, screenshots, IP logs, WhatsApp records and the detailed forensic report, adding that at the inquiry stage the accused had handed over his phone to the investigators and, after forensic examination, it was revealed that the “fake accounts and transmissions were linked to the accused’s number and IP address”.
On the other hand, the accused denied the allegations and claimed that he had been falsely implicated in the case by the complainant. However, the court rejected the defence plea and noted that the defence side had failed to produce substantial evidence in support of its claims.
A case was registered at the Federal Investigation Agency’s Cyber Crime Cell for offences under Sections 20, 21 and 24 of the Peca.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940498/in-letter-to-cjp-4-judges-term-sc-full-court-meeting-stamp-of-approval-for-already-decided-rules,"In letter to CJP, 4 judges term SC full court meeting ‘stamp of approval’ for ‘already decided’ rules - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","In yet another letter highlighting the rift within the judiciary, four Supreme Court (SC) judges expressed their reservations on Monday regarding the process being adopted for the review and approval of Supreme Court Rules 2025.
They dubbed the full court meeting, which was called for this purpose today, a mere “stamp of approval” for the rules, which they said were already decided and unilaterally approved.
The letter addressed to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
, was sent by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Ayesha Malik and Justice Athar Minallah. The four judges also skipped the full court meeting held later today.
They pointed out that “if the full court was not deemed necessary for the adoption of the rules themselves, how can it now be summoned to deliberate upon their amendment?”
The judges said the working paper for the meeting’s agenda stated that under Rule 1(4) of the Supreme Court Rules 2025, the CJP may “remove any difficulty in giving effect to the said rules” on the recommendations of a committee that was constituted by him and had already been formed.
Moreover, “the chief justice, through a letter dated August 12, 2025, informed the judges that the rules had already been approved through circulation and duly notified in the Gazette on August 9, 2025,” the judges highlighted.
Yet, they further stated, the CJP had sought suggestions “for further amendments” to the rules.
Calling into question the legality of the rules themselves, the judges noted that the “present Supreme Court rules were never placed before, nor approved by, the full court.”
Citing Article 191 of the Constitution, they said the SC had the “power to make rules regulating its practice and procedure, but this power is exercised collectively by the court as an institution”.
The judges concluded that any rules established “without deliberation and approval of the full court” lacked its approval and could not acquire “binding legal status”.
They were of the opinion that the rules, in their present form, “suffer from both substantive and procedural illegality”. In this connection, they expressed reservations that rules were processed through circulation.
“Circulation is an administrative convenience to deal with routine or minor procedural matters; it is not, and cannot be, the vehicle for laying down the constitutional architecture of this court’s governance.
“Unless the full court had itself had expressly resolved to adopt circulation for this purpose, the chief justice alone could not unilaterally resort to it.”
Further highlighting confusion around the matter, the judges said that the working paper for the meeting invoked “Rule 1(R) regarding removal of difficulties” during the process, despite there being no need to invoke the provision.
The judges deliberated that the provision was invoked only “to defend or justify the unilateral process already undertaken”.
“Instead of clarifying the legitimacy of the rules, this only exposes their infirmity: if no difficulty exists, why place such a point before the full court?” they asked.
The four SC judges termed the purpose behind the move “puzzling and fallacious”. The judges, in their letter, questioned why a full court was convened if the rules had already been notified as “approved” on August 9.
Within three days, on August 12, CJP “sought suggestions for amendment [to] the same rules”, the judges said.
They went on to add that “this sequence tacitly acknowledges that the full court is the correct forum for such deliberation,” but noted that it was only undertaken after the “fait accompli of unilateral approval”.
“This amounts to putting the cart before the horse-first declaring the Rules valid, and then calling the full court merely to consider patchwork amendments,” they added.
On that note, the judges regretted that the “meeting is being used to give a veneer of legitimacy to an otherwise invalid process,” and aimed to reduce the role of a full court to only “cosmetic”.
The forum was being used to ratify “what has already been done rather than discharging its true constitutional function under Article 191,” the judges claimed.
The judges recommended that the constitutional course of action would have been to “place the rules in their entirety, before the full court, permit genuine discussion and deliberation, and only thereafter seek formal approval.”
Calling for the abandonment of the meeting, the judges said that it was “designed to merely serve as a stamp of approval” and to proceed with it would be equal to reducing the “full court to an afterthought — convened not for decision-making but for damage control.”
The judges noted that such a move “undermines the collective authority of this court”.
Citing the above reservations, the four judges refused to attend the full court, unless a constitutional course of action is adopted, stating that, “we see no point in attending a meeting that is premised on amending rules which, in our respectful view, already suffer from illegality both in substance and in process.”
The letter further called for the objection to be presented in the minutes of the full court meeting and for the meeting to be made public.
“People are entitled to know how rules governing the internal life of the court came to be notified without discussion or deliberation amongst its judges,” the letter added, calling the meeting a ploy to “cloak” the whole process in a “semblance of legitimacy”.
“By opening our deliberations to the gaze of the people we serve, we reinforce the trust without which no constitutional court can function,” the letter concluded.
Last week, Justice Shah, in a separate letter to the CJP, had questioned why the historic revision of the 1980 rules was “approved by circulation”, rather than after a thorough discussion in the full court.
In March, a committee constituted by CJP Afridi was tasked to conduct a thorough review of the Supreme Court Rules of 1980, and
formulated
a comprehensive draft of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
The aim was to enhance transparency, efficiency and overall effectiveness in judicial proceedings.
However, when the draft of the new rules was circulated among the judges for consideration, some senior judges opposed the idea of approving them without a full court meeting, while the legal fraternity also
expressed
reservations about certain provisions.
Subsequently, CJP Afridi convened a full court
meeting
on Sept 8 (today) to finalise the rules and reconstituted the four-judge committee under Rule 1(4) of the proposed rules to recommend solutions for any difficulties in implementation.
Full court meeting
Later in the day, the full court meeting was held without the participation of the four judges.
A
press release
from the Supreme Court said CJP Afridi welcomed the participants and commended the efforts of the committee constituted to review the Supreme Court Rules, 1980. He appreciated the committee’s “exhaustive work”, undertaken with input from fellow judges and the legal fraternity, resulting in a comprehensive draft of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
The chief justice briefed the full court on the rules, the press release said, adding that after detailed deliberations on various provisions, the meeting’s participants unanimously agreed that the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, were a “living document” and should be subject to ongoing review and amendment as required from time to time.
“The full court, after considering various aspects and deliberating upon some of the critical provisions, unanimously decided to postpone the implementation of amendments to the extent of enhancement of court fees and securities for the time being. The committee shall consider the suggestions from honourable judges, the bar representatives or other stakeholders in this regard for placement before the full court for decision in light of the committee’s recommendations.
“The honourable chief justice termed this development a significant milestone, reflecting the judiciary’s commitment to strengthening institutional frameworks and ensuring that the Supreme Court Rules remain dynamic, responsive and in line with contemporary needs,” the press release said.",2025-09-08,Umer Mehtab,2068,0.000215

restraining order
that barred him from performing judicial functions after a division bench raised serious questions about the
validity of his law degree
from Karachi University.
Filed by Justice Jahangiri in person, the appeal before the Supreme Court pleaded for the Sept 16 restraining order to be set aside and suspended during the pendency of the petition, and for the division bench to be directed to hold back from proceeding further.
The two-judge IHC bench, headed by Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar alongside  Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, had issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed by lawyer Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution. The petition sought a writ of quo warranto, questioning “by what authority” Justice Jahangiri held judicial office.
In his appeal under Article 185(3), Justice Jahangiri cited the 2010 Iftikhar Chaudhry case, in which the SC had held that the Constitution did not permit any restraint on the exercise of judicial powers by a judge or any limitation on him during proceedings envisaged by Article 209. The ruling also held that even a temporary disability placed on a judge in the discharge of constitutional and official obligations amounts to removal from office and is therefore not permissible under the Constitution.
The Sept 16 order, the appeal argued, was patently mala fide in its conception and contrary to what transpired in open court. It added that the restraining order was passed in a palpable conflict of interest, opening the door to an egregious encroachment on judicial independence, allowing a larger bench of the high court to restrain fellow judges from performing their judicial functions.
The appeal stressed that although interference in interlocutory matters is an exception to the general rule, an exception arises when an order is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to settled principles of law.
In such cases, he argued, the Supreme Court is bound to intervene to prevent miscarriage of justice. It is a settled principle that no injunction may be granted without the three prerequisites of a prima facie case, irreparable loss, and balance of convenience being satisfied.
However, the Sept 16 order, which the appeal described as a non-speaking order, contains no discussion of these indispensable elements, thereby lacking legal foundation. It argued that the order overturns the convention that the court is a collegiate body of judges, each exercising equal judicial power, who are required to discharge their duties in a manner that upholds comity among them.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1943786,Footprints: Piecing life together post-flood - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"Travelling across the Bambawali-Ravi-Bedian (BRB) Canal — one of the region’s
worst-hit
after the Ravi flooded Narowal district late last month — one can see signs of normalcy slowly returning.
In
villages
along the border with India, people are back in their fields, repairing link roads and watercourses. Tube wells once again irrigate rice fields, while youngsters fish in the river and in the ponds left behind by the flood. Speaking to them reveals a quiet resilience and determination to rebuild.
The river has now receded to its banks after a week of
flooding
, but the damage remains stark. Many residents watch as weakened homes crack or collapse.
Grain stocks are dampened even when spared direct contact with floodwater. Farm machinery is rusting, and stagnant water lingers in low-lying fields — breeding mosquitoes and pests across the uneven landscape. Irrigation channels lie collapsed or choked with mud.
Farmers thankful for rain that saved their crops from being buried under silt & mud brought by overflowing rivers
Thousands of acres of water-sensitive crops such as vegetables, fodder and sesame lie flattened, leaving farmers counting losses. Rice and sorghum fields largely survived, but hundreds — if not thousands — of acres in low-lying areas were destroyed.
“Nature has its own ways of helping in the most testing times,” says 52-year-old Iqbal, a resident of village Kajla. He explains that after the floods, 72 hours of torrential rain spared farmers from total destruction. In fields that were not low-lying, the rain washed away thick layers of mud that would otherwise have smothered the plants.
The flood had already re-energised the root zone with fresh silt deposits. “That’s why you can still see some green fields,” Iqbal says. “Without the rain, this picture would have been completely different.”
Alongside their courage to survive and faith in divine help, flood survivors also lament official neglect during and after the disaster. “This attitude multiplies the risks to our lives and makes survival harder,” they say.
Their sentiments broadly reflect three realities: the sheer scale of the tragedy, a fearful community struggling to rebuild, and poorly planned waterworks that have added to their misery.
The shifting river: a rising threat
The post-flood reality is visible in every corner of Narang Mandi.
Irrigation channels are silted up and clogged with mud. Each village has collapsed houses on its outskirts and cracked walls along its streets, where residents appeal to every visitor, often mistaking them for officials assessing compensation.
Poverty, deepened by the floods, is evident everywhere.
Roads linking the villages have either been washed away or deliberately breached by villagers to drain water, leaving them impassable for traffic. Commuting is now limited to trudging on foot or riding motorbikes along submerged paths.
Life is edging back to normal, but the progress is painfully slow, as villagers have only themselves to rely on.
“Villagers will repair their homes and streets in the coming days or weeks,” says 52-year-old Ashfaq Baryar of Baryar village on the Ravi’s bank. “What we cannot handle are the larger issues — the river drifting closer to our villages, consuming fertile land and depriving millions of their livelihoods,” he laments.
According to him, embankments are not reinforced, and each season water erodes the dykes, leaving them weaker until floods wash them away. He adds that the very nature of flooding has also changed.
In the past, floodwaters used to rise slowly, inch by inch — or at worst, foot by foot in emergencies. This time, it was a five-foot wall of water that swept across the area within two hours and stayed for over a week, leaving farmers little chance to flee or respond, Ashfaq says.
“It was an entirely new pattern, unheard of even in the stories of our ancestors. The very nature of the threat has changed, and even those of us who have lived here for generations do not know how to face it.”
Infrastructural flaws
Farhan Shaukat of Kot Bhailan explains the area’s vulnerability. Three water systems converge here, turning it into a vast pond. The Ravi, after zigzagging along the border, re-enters Pakistani territory and floods the land. The Marala-Ravi (MR) Link, carrying 22,000 cusecs, also ends here.
Finally, the elevated banks of the BRB Canal trap water between the Pakistan-India border and Lahore, submerging more than 50 villages along the 40-km stretch until the Ravi reaches Shahdara. These structures combine to create — and sustain — millions of cubic feet of stagnant water, which only drains once the Ravi begins to recede. This pattern has persisted for decades.
“The last two kilometres of the MR Canal have no banks,” says 60-year-old Riyasat Ali Kahloon of Khundey village. When the Ravi swells, it blocks the canal’s flow, which then reverses to flood villages between its endpoint and the river. “We have raised this issue with politicians and policymakers for years. They only made promises to build the embankment but never acted. In recent years we’ve been told the project was approved and procedures completed, yet no work has begun,” he says.
He warns that flaws in the man-made system must be fixed before it is too late. “The cost of the proposed embankment would be a fraction of what we lost in just one week of flooding.”

• Says state can readily meet targets by aligning its spending with constitutional and legal provisions
ISLAMABAD: Arguing against the
Super Tax
, senior counsel Ahmed Jamal Sukhera told the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench (CB) on Monday that the Constitution does not permit arbitrary action, including legislation.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the CB was hearing several challenges filed by different taxpayers questioning the constitutional vires of the amended Section 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO), 2001 implemented for the tax year 2023.
Representing Fauji Fertilisers, Mr Sukhera contended that the levy was imposed by the federal government to raise Rs215 billion, merely because it was seeking fiscal space.
In the previous year, the government had imposed taxes of Rs350 billion through sales tax, which was even collected on matchsticks. According to a policy statement, he claimed that this measure had pushed some people below the poverty line.
Therefore, this year, the government had considered taxing high-earning individuals on the grounds that they had made windfall profits, and decided that the solution for fiscal space was to impose a super tax on them, the counsel said.
The counsel stated that only two factors were considered when imposing the super tax: firstly, that the sales tax imposed last year to raise Rs215bn had an inflationary impact; and second, that high-earning persons had made windfall profits and could be taxed to raise the additional Rs215bn.
No other factor was considered, according to the policy statement submitted by the government in its pleadings, the counsel argued, adding that as per reports of the cabinet and the World Bank, fiscal space of up to Rs1.7tr annually could be created simply by aligning federal government spending with constitutional and legal provisions.
The counsel cited seven examples. He said state-owned enterprises incur losses between Rs600 to Rs800bn annually, so the required Rs215bn could instead be raised by curtailing those losses.
Secondly, the federal government continues to spend on subjects devolved to the provinces under the 18th Amendment, which is not aligned with the Constitution. As per the World Bank report, Rs328bn could be saved this way. Moreover, adopting a treasury single account could save another Rs404bn, according to the same report.
The fourth example he gave was that, according to the federal government figures, electricity thefts and related losses amount to Rs600bn annually. Reducing this loss by just Rs215bn could spare high earning taxpayers from the super tax.
Fifthly, under the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act, 2005 (FDRLA), the federal fiscal deficit should not go beyond 3.5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the debt-to-GDP ratio should not exceed 60pc. Both these limits have been consistently breached since 2016.
In case of non-compliance, the FRDLA requires the federal government to take corrective measures, including curtailing expenditures from the Federal Consolidated Fund, to return to the debt reduction path within two financial years.
This means that if the debt-to-GDP ratio is not maintained within the prescribed limit, the government must curtail its expenses. However, instead of doing so, the government continues to borrow, and the resulting interest payments — incurred in violation of statutory requirements — are shifted onto existing taxpayers by either increasing tax rates or imposing new taxes.
Mr Sukhera argued that the government is constitutionally and legally bound to spend public money as a fiduciary and trustee of the people of Pakistan, in their best interest. Public money, he stressed, must not be wasted year after year without accountability. He further argued that it was high time the government was compelled to curtail its expenses so that existing taxpayers are not burdened with additional taxes through no fault of their own.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1938934/with-sindh-facing-a-very-high-flood-heres-what-authorities-must-do-to-save-thousands-of-lives,"With Sindh facing a ‘very high flood’, here’s what authorities must do to save thousands of lives - Pakistan - DAWN.COM","The Indus River roars with a force that has tested Sindh time and again. As a learner of flood management, I have been directly part of the 1994, 1995, 1997, 2010, 2015 river floods and the 2003, 2005 (Balochistan), 2011 and 2022 rain-induced floods. And now, in just three to four days, a very high flood looms over the province, threatening to engulf us yet again.
The water is expected to
surpass 700,000 cusecs
with a 10-20 per cent margin of uncertainty, pushing possible peaks and likely hitting 775,000 to 850,000 cusecs. Upstream, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) have already been
battered by floods
that have claimed hundreds of lives and shattered infrastructure, most of which was built in the waterway or flood plains of the rivers.
I have said this before, and I will say this again: people may forget, but rivers remember their ways.
In KP, forests, once lush green, have been shaved bald, causing fatal landslides. On the other hand, unplanned urbanisation, an inadequate flood-resilient infrastructure and poor river management have all aggravated the situation.
One mission
When it comes to Sindh, where 1.65 million lives are at stake, we stand at a pivotal moment: falter under criticism or unite — government, institutions, communities — in a singular mission to guide this flood to the sea and save our people, our province, our country.
The Sindh Irrigation Department, charged with taming this colossal flow, faces sharp scrutiny. Decades of weak flood infrastructure planning and execution, political interference, and systemic corruption across federal and provincial governance have eroded its capacity, a malaise echoing through Pakistan’s disaster management framework, laid bare by the 2010 and 2022 historical floods that displaced millions and caused over $30 billion in damages.
Yet, the department remains a cornerstone of flood-fighting, its engineers holding the line where newer entities such as the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) fall short. The revenue department and district administrations, despite inefficiencies rooted in their colonial and bureaucratic character, wield immense power to mobilise resources, coordinate relief, and enforce actions.
If we can shake off their rigid, outdated ways and rally them to the mission of saving the country and its citizens, their authority can turn positively for the vulnerable people and areas. Blanket criticism, especially now, risks breaking the spirit of those on the frontlines.
Between panic, criticism, and actions, the truth rings clear: saving lives comes first. Let us sharpen our critiques to target specific weaknesses — unrepaired barrage gates, riverbank encroachments, private embankments — and act swiftly to mend them.
The challenge
Sindh faces a unique challenge: the Indus flows on an elevated ridge, higher than the surrounding land, with no breaching sections or escape routes for excess water. When the river breaks free, as it did in the
2010 Tori Bund breach
, it carves paths hundreds of miles long, flooding areas like Manchhar Lake and drowning Khairpur Nathan Shah.
Since 2010, promises of projects for river outlets and flood escape canals have stalled, leaving us with one task: to guide the floods to the sea safely. The province’s 1,400 miles of embankments, with 875 miles as the first line of defence along the Indus, hold over 140 vulnerable points prone to erosion, scouring, or breaches. The water’s speed demands we fortify this first line of defence at Guddu first, then almost immediately at Sukkur, and finally at Kotri barrages.
At the heart of this crisis are 1.65 million people in the riverine katcha areas across 14 districts — Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, Hyderabad, Thatta — where 273,000 families, their homes, crops, and livestock face peril. Once, indigenous floodplain communities thrived through nomadic resilience, moving to higher ground with ancestral knowledge of the river’s rhythms, and knew exactly at what river discharge, what coping mechanism was to be applied.
But the rise of an aggressive agriculture-based economy has rooted permanent settlements — concrete homes and farmlands — that now stand vulnerable. Encroachments for crops have choked natural flood channels, heightening risks of erosion and breaches, as seen in past devastations.
Landowners in these areas deserve economic benefits, but these must align with historical practices, British-era surveys, water laws, and our Constitution, ensuring no one’s profit endangers another’s life.
Bracing for the upcoming water flows, evacuations have begun with over 24,000 people moved to over 300 relief camps. Yet, many cling to their katcha homes, unwilling to abandon their livestock (read: their lifeline).
Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro are
inspecting sites
, including the Guddu Barrage, their presence signalling urgency. To reach katcha residents, mobile relief units — equipped with boats, emergency supplies, and veterinary support — must deliver aid on-site, honouring traditional coping strategies while addressing modern risks.
The agony and pain of camp life were demonstrated in the
2022 floods
, and the same echoes in
Punjab’s recent flood camps
— a horrible experience, especially for women and the elderly.
The plan
From decades of facing floods, a clear path emerges — a multi-layered strategy to safeguard Sindh.
First and foremost, fortify the frontline. Urgent repairs to embankments and barrage gates must begin with Guddu, then Sukkur, and Kotri. The “three Ms” — man, material, machinery — are the foundation: active camps, trained staff, excavators, bulldozers, flood-fighting equipment, and open supply routes.
At the same time, small details matter — mosquito repellent for workers, life jackets for those measuring river levels by boat. Real-time monitoring through satellite data and field river gauge observations, with alerts in Sindhi and Urdu, will keep us ahead of the flood. It must be round the clock, not leaving the frontline unattended for a spur-of-the-moment.
The next step is the mobilisation of all institutions, from the revenue department to the local administration. They must shed their colonial bureaucratic shackles, enforce actions, and join the engineers of the irrigation department who hold “unity of command” per the Bund Manual — a document detailing rules for river channel operation and maintenance.
Narrow bridges, like Dadu-Moro, choke floodwaters, as seen in 2010 when a cut in the approach road saved a city. Inspect and widen bridge approaches now. The 2022 Sindh Indus River Commission’s plan to expand all bridges must move forward, no matter the cost, once we have safely handled the current floods.
Separately, local leaders and residents must support watch posts and patrols, armed with spades and torches. Social media can dispel rumours or confirm threats, but only if we visit sites and act. Updated data on private embankments —
ordered
removed post-2010 by the Supreme Court — is critical. Have they returned by 2025?
Next comes delivering relief, particularly to those who need it the most. Start with evacuating women, children and the elderly. Camps need food, water, medicines, and document pouches, with mobile health units to curb disease outbreaks.
A national emergency can align federal and provincial efforts, with the NDMA leading to ease Sindh’s isolation. The authority has both power and money, but they are least linked with communities on the ground. Here, the irrigation department and other organisations can provide links and connectivity.
Transparent resource allocation, overseen by opposition leaders and civil society, will silence corruption allegations. Ad hoc task forces, guided by neutral bodies like the Supreme Court-mandated water commission, can mend institutional gaps.
Coming together
This flood exposes deep challenges.
The PPP’s governance since 2008 has faced accusations of prioritising elite projects over resilient infrastructure, while federal-provincial disputes over water persist. Pakistan’s reactive flood management, stalling reforms, amplifies climate-driven risks. The National Flood Protection Program IV has been in the doldrums for the last eight years or so.
Yet, in this moment, the Quran’s wisdom guides us: “Whoever saves one life, it is as if they have saved all of humanity.”
With hours ticking down, all relevant public sector departments, and all of Sindh must unite — shedding bureaucratic inertia for a mission to save lives, Sindh, and Pakistan. Long-term reforms — vulnerability mapping, anti-encroachment drives, sustainable agriculture — await, but today, we guide this flood to the sea, as the Indus waters wait for no one.

According to police, the accident occurred when two Zambad vehicles, travelling from the Pakistan-Iran border toward Panjgur town, collided in the Goran area due to excessive speed.
“Both vehicles immediately caught fire,” police stated. “The drivers could not exit the burning vehicles and died before reaching the hospital.”
Responding to emergency calls, police and rescue teams arrived at the scene, retrieving the bodies and transporting the injured to a local hospital.
“The victims were completely burnt and were beyond identification,” hospital officials noted.
The injured, who sustained critical burn injuries, might be transferred to Karachi for further medical treatment, officials added. Police were investigating the collision’s circumstances.
The Balochistan government had previously imposed a ban on Iranian smuggled petrol and diesel, which impacted local residents economically, as many families in border areas rely on this trade for their livelihood.
Despite the ban, the Makran administration recently permitted the limited import of petrol and diesel from Iran. Consequently, Iranian petrol has surfaced in the provincial capital of Quetta and other regions.

Maternal and Child Support Programme
(MCSP), being run by the Sindh Social Protection Authority (SSPA), to seven additional districts, increasing its coverage to 22 districts.
According to officials, the expansion aims to improve maternal and child health by providing integrated healthcare services along with enhanced cash support to pregnant and lactating women.
The decision was taken during the second meeting of the SSPA board held at the CM House. Attendees included Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, Education Minister Syed Sardar Shah, Special Assistant to the CM on Social Protection Sarfraz Rajar, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Chairman Planning and Development Najam Shah, Finance Secretary Fayaz Jatoi, and Social Protection Secretary Muzamel Halepoto.
SSPA Chief Executive Officer Samiullah Shaikh briefed the participants on the current status of the programme being run in 15 districts.
Larkana, Sukkur, Khairpur, Shaheed Benazirabad, Jamshoro, Dadu and Naushahro Feroze join the list of 22 districts where scheme has been implemented
While granting approval for the extension, the chief minister stated that the initiative was part of the government’s strategy to improve maternal health, reduce poverty and empower women, particularly in rural Sindh.
Under the decision, the programme will now also cover Larkana, Sukkur, Khairpur, Shaheed Benazirabad, Jamshoro, Dadu and Naushahro Feroze. In addition, the cash support to pregnant and lactating women has been increased from Rs30,000 to Rs41,000, to be disbursed over a period of three years.
According to officials, this assistance is aimed at ensuring proper maternal nutrition, promoting regular health check-ups and encouraging safe deliveries.
The
programme
is part of a broader Rs48.3 billion social protection initiative, of which Rs6.3bn is being contributed by the Sindh government.
Launched in January 2023, the programme is scheduled to continue until December 2027.
To date, 770,000 pregnant and lactating women have been registered at 800 health facilities across the province, including 740 centres operated by the People’s Primary Healthcare Initiative (PPHI) and 62 health facilities run by the health department.
Eligibility criteria include being at least 18 years old, holding a valid Computerised National Identity Card and residing in the targeted districts.
The MCSP, officials say, is based on a conditional cash transfer model, linking financial support to key maternal health milestones such as antenatal visits, institutional deliveries and postnatal care. The goal is to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates and ensure better health outcomes for both mothers and children in low-income, underserved communities.
Based on population data and birth rate projections, an estimated 2.6 million pregnant and lactating women will live in the intervention districts over the programme’s five-year span. The government aims to reach 1.3m women, representing 50 per cent coverage of the projected eligible population.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1945454/na-passes-resolution-condemning-alleged-verbal-abuse-of-senior-journalist-by-pti-founder,NA passes resolution condemning alleged verbal abuse of senior journalist by PTI founder - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"Members of the Parliamentary Reporters Association of Pakistan (PRA) on Monday staged a mass walkout from a session of the National Assembly, over senior journalist Ijaz Ahmed allegedly being subjected to misbehaviour by PTI founder Imran Khan.
According to Ahmed, who spoke to
Dawn.com
, the walkout was organised by the PRA Pakistan’s Election Committee.
“[The] PTI founder hurled abuse at me for asking questions,” Ahmed said.
National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq directed Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to hold talks with PRA. During the walkout, the speaker noted that the PRA submitted a written complaint over the issue, which Tarar spoke about during his address.
Later, the National Assembly released visuals of Ahmed meeting with Speaker Sadiq in his office.
“It is your (reporters) right to protest and politics and journalism have a deep relationship,” the minister said, requesting that the reporters listen to what he has to say. “You have a valid complaint.”
“A senior member of the PRA was involved in a verbal altercation at Adiala Jail with a senior leader who hurled foul language at him,” the law minister stated, not mentioning the PTI founder by name.
“It is the job of reporters and journalists to criticise us and show us our reflection in the mirror. We should take this criticism to heart and not silence or attack them.”
Tarar said that Ahmed requested the speaker’s office for permission to speak with Imran at Adiala and requested protection.
“After the discussion and the way he (Ahmed) was abused, there was a social media onslaught targeting him,” Tarar added. “Posts said ‘Look at this man’s face’, ‘don’t forgive him’ and ‘look what he said about our
Quaid
’.
“This is a distinguished House and I must request that we behave democratically,” he said. “We need to prove through our own attitudes that we listen to other people and that there is room for decency and politics in this House.”
PPP lawmaker Shazia Marri noted in her address that Ahmed is a renowned journalist in Islamabad and has links to Sindh.
“In terms of his reporting, he is a decent journalist,” she said. “We may have differences of opinion, but in terms of his reporting and ethics, he is commendable.”
Marri added that journalists expose problems plaguing the country and face issues while doing so. She also condemned people posting Ahmed’s face on social media and “making him a target of hate”.
“We keep saying that they criticise politicians, but we criticise each other for not protecting journalists. Why do we forget to offer them protection?”
After a recess, Ahmed himself spoke on the floor of the House and said that he had gone to Adiala Jail on the speaker’s request and heard from Khan about his treatment at Adiala Jail.
“We told him that we would speak about this on the floor of the House,” Ahmed said.
“He (Imran) had two demands: the first being that Ahmed speak about how no PTI members were part of an opposition delegation to visit him in jail. The other was that he wanted a resolution passed about this incident.”
Imran also demanded that the Sindh government launch a “high-level investigation” into the
murder
of anchorperson Imtiaz Mir.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) MNA Syed Aminul Haque, who was a part of the delegation, alleged that Imran hurled threats and foul language at Ahmed.
“Immediately afterwards, we saw him being trolled on social and digital media,” Haque said, adding that the MQM condemned the incident. “People were trying to get his address and threaten his family. Journalists have a right to ask questions. People are free not to answer, but to threaten them and be rude is undemocratic.”
A resolution was presented before the House condemning the verbal altercation and stating that not only did Imran use harsh language, but also launched a social media campaign against Ahmed and other senior journalists.
It demanded that Ahmed and other journalists receive immediate protection, legal action be taken against those responsible and also condemned Mir’s murder in Karachi, demanding an investigation into the shooting.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, however, requested that the resolution not be presented because it would “ruin the atmosphere of the House”.
“We pay tribute to the media; they have played a key role in highlighting our struggles and raising their voices for the people,” he said. “I was not able to meet [Imran] Khan
sahib
, so I wanted to know what happened. I reached to three of their (PRA) people.
“A limited number of people are allowed at Adiala Jail,” he added. “We don’t know the exact words he used. We do not know what happened, we don’t even know what happens during jail trials.”
The resolution was adopted after a vote, however, there was booing and hollering heard in the House.
“If you are saying no, does that mean you are saying that what happened with Ijaz Ahmed was right?” Speaker Sadiq asked after the resolution was passed.
Tarar took the floor once again, stating that he is one of those who has always tried to ensure that there is no pressure on the media.
“We heard what the PTI chairman said and we will not say anything distressing, but a journalist came and spoke in parliament saying that he was called an ‘agent’,” he said. “We need to see how people who raise their voices are treated.”

funds
improperly held in private bank accounts by government officials, according to a review of recent audit reports.
The commitee’s meeting, presided over by Chairman Asghar Ali Tareen, identified what it called serious lapses in financial discipline and gross violations in the handling of budgetary allocations and
revenue collection
across several government departments.
An audit report for 2016-17 revealed that of the Rs3.34 billion allocated for non-development funds, Rs740.6 million in savings were never surrendered, reflecting weak fiscal control.
In a more significant breach, between 2020 and 2022, deputy commissioners kept more than Rs19.14bn in bank accounts instead of depositing the money into the provincial treasury as required by financial rules.
Audit reveals uncollected taxes, mismanaged funds plaguing the province
Further findings showed a lack of transparency and collection failures. Auditors were denied access to expenditure records worth Rs33.74m from 2019-21, the report stated.
During the same period, the government failed to collect over Rs1.1bn in Usher, irrigation tax and agricultural income tax, depriving the exchequer of critical revenue.
The committee also cited the improper issuance of cheques worth Rs228.96m from commissioners’ offices, which were made out to DDOs instead of directly to vendors.
PAC Chairman Zafar Tareen expressed “serious concern” over the findings, demanding that all budget savings be surrendered without delay.
He warned of disciplinary measures against any officials found obstructing financial transparency.
The PAC directed the immediate submission of all pending records to audit auth-orities and the mandatory deposit of all withheld funds into the treasury.
It called for strict action against negligent officers, with the chairman stating that financial discipline cannot be ensured without strict adherence to rules. The committee also criticised several deputy commissioners for failing to comply with PAC directives issued as far back as 2020.

The tournament had remained under a cloud of uncertainty following a four-day aerial war between Pakistan and India in May, and it was only after a conclave of the heads of the ACC that the organisation’s president, Mohsin Naqvi, who is also Pakistan Cricket Board chairperson,
announced
that the continental championship would be played.
Despite the announcement of a detailed schedule the next day, doubts remained. There had been calls in India to boycott matches against Pakistan after an Indian team had
forfeited
their group-stage and semi-final matches against a Pakistani side in the World Championship of Legends, a competition for retired players, in July.
The dust, however, settled late last month when India’s Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports greenlit their sporting teams’ participation in multi-team events that included Pakistan.
Such are the new realities.
Cricket, of late, has become hostage to the India-Pakistan geopolitical tensions and the fate of global and continental competitions is settled at the eleventh hour. The schedule for the
ICC Champions Trophy
– held in Pakistan earlier this year – was announced less than two months out of the opening fixture, and, in 2023, the match details for the 50-over World Cup were made public only 100 days out of the tournament.
But, from Tuesday, cricket will take centre stage as Afghanistan and Hong Kong play the tournament opener in Abu Dhabi. India, the hosts of this Asia Cup, will play the UAE on Wednesday in Dubai.
The rivalry between Afghanistan and Pakistan has shaped up nicely over the years with the contest offering some thrilling encounters.Its not a strong team vs minnow clash anymore, with Afghanistan’s spin resources and improving batting prowess making them one of the most balanced T20 sides in the world. — AFP
Pakistan’s first match is on Friday against Oman in Dubai, which also hosts the final of this 19-match tournament on 28 September.
Wait! Why is the tournament being played in the UAE when India are the hosts?
The new realities, remember?
In the lead-up to the aforementioned Champions Trophy, Pakistan and India
agreed
to host each other on neutral venues in multi-team tournaments for the next three years due to the ever-increasing geopolitical tensions between them.
Since India had to stage Pakistan’s matches out of their country, the Board for Control of Cricket in India and ACC agreed to move the entire tournament to the UAE, with the BCCI retaining the hosting rights.
Pakistan provided Dubai as a neutral venue for India earlier this year when they hosted the Champions Trophy, the first major tournament in the country since the 1996 World Cup.
India will
host
Pakistan’s women’s team in Colombo in the 50-over women’s World Cup, which begins immediately after the Asia Cup. Sri Lanka will also be the venue for Pakistan’s T20 World Cup matches – again hosted by India – next year.
It is, however, not the first time that the tensions between the two neighbours have moved the Asia Cup out of India. The 2018 50-over Asia Cup had to be shifted to the UAE due to similar reasons. Coincidentally, the ACC presidency at the time also sat with the PCB.
The last T20 Asia Cup, in 2022, was to be played in Sri Lanka but was moved to the UAE because of the economic and political turmoil in the country.
There is also a strong feeling among the ACC members that the UAE serves as a perfect venue for the Asia Cup since the country boasts large diasporas from every nook and corner of Asia, which results in healthy support for each side and helps with decent crowd turnover.
Dubai hosts a total of 11 matches, and the remaining eight will be played in Abu Dhabi. Pakistan will play all their games in Dubai.
You mentioned that the 2018 Asia Cup was an ODI tournament.  Are there two formats of this tournament?
Correct. The ACC, since 2016, has aligned its calendar with the ICC’s to provide more context to its tournaments and better preparation to the teams for the global tournaments.
The first T20 Asia Cup was played in Bangladesh in 2016, weeks out of the T20 World Cup in India, and the second in 2022 ahead of the T20 World Cup in Australia. With the next year’s T20 World Cup in February-March, this tournament presents teams a crucial opportunity to finesse their combinations in a high-pressure tournament environment.
Bangladesh are not pushovers anymore and they showed it to Pakistan during the latter’s tour to Dhaka for a three-match T20I series. The Tigers have been able to build a decent side over the past few years but they still have to prove their mettle outside their own den, with Asia Cup the next opportunity. — AFP
The 2018 and 2023 editions of the tournament were played in ODI format, in line with the 2019 and 2023 50-over World Cups.
How many teams will play this Asia Cup, and what is the format of the tournament?
There is a bump of two teams this time around. So, for the first time, the tournament is being contested by eight teams.
The five full members – Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka – are joined by Hong Kong, Oman, and the UAE, the top three sides from last year’s ACC Premier Cup, which served as a qualifier for this tournament.
The eight teams are equally divided into two groups – A and B. Each team will play the other three teams in its group once, and the top two sides from the two groups will qualify for the Super Four round.
The Super Four will also be played in a round-robin format, and the top two teams will play in the final.
We have seen Pakistan and India come face to face twice in Asia Cups of late. What are the chances of the same happening again?
Let us start with how the two groups look.
India, Oman, Pakistan, and the UAE are in Group A. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka are in Group B.
It is not a coincidence that two weaker teams are drawn in the group that has India and Pakistan, and the three other stronger sides in this tournament find themselves in the same group.
The draws in the ICC and ACC tournaments are never televised, and the global and continental championships are especially designed to ensure at least one match between these two sides.
The reality is that India v Pakistan fills coffers. The money earned from this match is distributed among cricket boards around the world at the ICC and ACC levels. So, no cricket board really protests about the draws.
Pakistan and India will play the group stage match on 14 September. Considering all goes as usual and there are no upsets, the two teams will meet again in the Super Four A1 v A2 match on 21 September. Interestingly, 21 September this year is coming on a Sunday. (winks)
The two teams can meet for the third time if they make it to the final. They, however, have never faced off in an Asia Cup final.
How have the teams fared in T20 Asia Cups so far?
The first men’s T20 Asia Cup, in 2016, was won by India, who comfortably beat the hosts Bangladesh in the final.
Pakistan were stunned by Bhanuka Rajapaksa’s dazzling 71 not out off 45 in the final of the last T20 Asia Cup in 2022 and lost to Sri Lanka by 23 runs.
India have the best men’s T20 Asia Cup record, winning eight of their 10 matches. The next are title-defenders Sri Lanka, who have won six out of 10. Pakistan are the only other team to have played 10 men’s T20 Asia Cup matches, and they have won half of them.
Afghanistan have won four out of eight. Bangladesh and the UAE have three wins from seven games each. Oman have one win from three games. Hong Kong are yet to register a win in the tournament.
Team record in men’s T20 Asia Cup
by Dawn
How have the eight teams prepared for this month’s competition?
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the UAE enter the Asia Cup fresh from the tri-series in Sharjah. The series was organised specifically to help the three sides prepare for this tournament after the UAE had emerged as the venue for the Asia Cup.
Afghanistan were supposed to tour Pakistan for a bilateral T20I series, but the two boards decided to move those matches to the UAE to acclimatise to the conditions in this part of the world. UAE, the new hosts, were included as the third team, as a bilateral series was turned into a trilateral affair.
India, the T20 world champions, last played a T20I on 2 February 2025. They have played only five matches in the format this year in a home series against England that they won 4-1. Prior to the team’s arrival in the UAE, most of their players had been playing red ball cricket at home in the Duleep Trophy.
Bangladesh, over the last week, hosted the Netherlands for a three-match T20I series in Sylhet and won it 2-0, with the third match getting washed out.
Sri Lanka arrive in the UAE from Zimbabwe, where they played the home team in two ODIs and three T20Is.
Pakistan-Sri Lanka matches have been friendly affairs historically but that doesn’t rule out the title defenders capability to shine in tough matches. Their fiery show in the 2022 Asia Cup final must be etched in the Pakistan players’ minds. — AFP
Oman, captained by Jatinder Singh and coached by former Sri Lankan batter Duleep Mendis, announced four uncapped players in their squad for this tournament. They enter this tournament after playing a domestic T20 competition recently. Their last international outing was in May in the men’s Cricket World Cup League 2.
Hong Kong, in July, named Kaushal Silva, a former Sri Lankan wicketkeeper-batter, as their head coach, and this Asia Cup will be his first assignment. They also have a new captain in Yasim Murtaza, who has played for Rawalpindi in Pakistan’s domestic first-class, List A, and T20 competitions.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942047,‘Trial courts can entertain bail in drug cases registered after amendment to narcotics law’ - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: Although the Sindh government has restored the district judiciary’s power to grant bail in narcotics cases through an amendment to the Sindh Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 2024
, a sessions judge has ruled that trial courts can entertain bail applications only for cases registered after the amendment.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Liaqat Ali Khoso, who also serves as the presiding officer of the Special Court (Control of Narcotic Substances), Malir, observed this while dismissing several bail applications in drugs cases registered before the amendment, holding that these cases fell under the original prohibitory clause of Section 35 of the Sindh Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 2024.
However, the court advised the applicants to approach the Sindh High Court’s constitutional bench under Article 199 of the Constitution for enforcement of their fundamental rights, as established by binding precedent.
In its detailed identical orders, the court noted that cases registered before the amendment created an absolute bar on the grant of bail in narcotics cases under Section 35 of the Act, which states: “No bail is to be granted in respect of certain offences — (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in sections 496 and 497 of the Code, bail shall not be granted to an accused person charged with an offence under this Act.”
Dismisses pleas in cases registered before the amendment to the Sindh Control of Narcotic Substances Act
It added that on Aug 18, Section 35 of the Act was amended to provide for the grant of bail, while the enabling clause under Section 1(2) of the Amendment Act states: “It shall come into force at once.”
However, the court observed: “The fundamental principle is that amendments affecting substantive rights operate prospectively unless the legislature expressly provides for retrospective application with clear and unambiguous language. In the amended Act, 2025 for example section 27 was amended with para: “Provided also that the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be deemed to have been taken effect on and from 28.10.2024. It shows the clear intention of the legislature that as to which provisions are to take retrospective effect. The position is not covered under section 35 as amended on 18.08.2025.”
The judge cited reported judgment of the superior court, which held that “assemblies cannot enact retrospective laws that affect fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution”.
“The amendment converting the provision which was earlier not covered for bail into one which provides right of bail, affects the substantive right of the accused to seek bail. Such amendments, affecting vested rights, cannot be applied retrospectively without express legislative intent. Such intent is missing in the amendment dated: 18.08.2025,” the court observed.
“The enabling provision ‘It shall come into force at once’ indicates immediate prospective application from 18.08.2025, not retrospective application to cases already registered.”
“The amendment to Section 35 of the Sindh CNS Act, 2024, dated: 18.08.2025, operates prospectively and applies only to cases registered on or after 18.08.2025,” the court ruled, adding that cases registered before the amendment, “remains governed by the original Section 35, which bars the grant of bail. The amendment cannot be given retrospective effect as it affects the substantive rights of accused persons, and no express legislative intent for retrospectively is evident.”

Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the body of the boy, identified as Saad, was brought to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) on Monday night for medico-legal formalities.
She said the body was in an advanced state of decomposition and bore multiple bone fractures. “The findings are consistent with anal sexual violence,” she said. The cause of death was determined to be massive head trauma inflicted by a hard and blunt object.
Area SHO Rizwan Patel said that the boy went missing from the Landhi area. His father, Mohammed Salman, had lodged an FIR on Sept 18 under Section 364-A of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 3(i) of the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018.
The police had launched a search by utilising intelligence sources in different areas and on Monday, at around 9:15pm, the body, stuffed in a gunny bag, was recovered from an empty plot in the 4-B area of Landhi.

Dawn
has learnt.
A few months ago, AJK police initiated a strike with an 11-point charter of demands. These include increases in medical allowance, conveyance allowance, house rent, and the implementation of a career progression system similar to that of Punjab police. Additionally, there are demands for improved retirement policies, training, housing, and educational facilities for the children of police personnel.
In July, AJK police observed a pen-down strike and subsequently organised a state-wide strike to demand better rights and facilities in major districts.
The manpower for law enforcement in AJK should consider the police protests and strikes in the region. Moreover, the government suspects that the AJK police may extend their protests and strikes, potentially expressing further resentment.
Sources within the interior ministry told
Dawn
that a few days ago, in a meeting, the heads of five departments and forces, including Islamabad Police, FC, and FIA, were instructed to mobilise forces for deployment in AJK, particularly at key, sensitive, and significant installations.
They have also arranged the equipment resources currently used by the forces for deployment in AJK.
The department heads were urged to assemble the forces promptly and prepare to respond positively. They requested time to organise the necessary manpower and equipment.
They were instructed to expedite the process; however, they will have three days to reach AJK once the deployment order is issued.
The sources revealed that 4,000 personnel from the capital police and FC were asked. In response, the capital police agreed to provide a force of 2,000 officers, and the FC and FIA also committed to arranging manpower.
Subsequently, in line with their commitments to the interior ministry, the capital police are preparing to deploy 2,000 personnel to AJK.
A letter issued by the office of the AIG Establishment on Saturday, addressed to the DG Safe City, DIGs of Operations, Law and Order, AIGs of Special Branch, Logistics, SSPs of Security, CTD, and Traffic, requested a “provision of strength”. It stated that, according to the directions of the IGP Islamabad, the specified police personnel must be sent to AJK temporarily.

calls
by the PPP to help
flood
survivors via the Benazir Income Support Programme, PML-N lea­der Rana Sanaullah called for a complete overhaul of the initiative that provides direct cash stipends to millions of people.
He made these remarks in a TV show hosted by Gharidah Farooqi. Rana Sana, who is also the PM’s aide on political affairs, said the BISP could not be continued in its current form — it either needed to be wrapped up or be completely revamped.
The PML-N leader suggested ‘Benazir Rozgar Scheme’ or ‘Hunarmand Scheme’ would be a more effective way to provide skills and employment opportunities to its beneficiaries instead of a monthly stipend. He said the matter would be discussed in parliament, adding that even some PPP leaders were also in agreement with this proposal.
He claimed the federal government has been spending a huge chunk of money on the BISP, which he believed to be inappropriate due to the current fiscal crunch. Rana Sanaullah said BISP should not be used to help flood victims as its ‘true spirit’ required that the programme help people achieve self-sufficiency instead of merely providing financial assistance.
A BISP official told
Dawn
that the PM’s aide had made this statement in his personal capacity and no such proposal was being discussed at present.
On the other hand, the BISP, at a meeting, reviewed plans for a secure, transparent, and accessible payment system for beneficiaries.
The initiative aims to make financial assistance more secure, transparent, and easily accessible for millions of BISP beneficiaries across Pakistan, said a statement on Thursday.
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman has repeatedly urged the government to extend BISP to nearly three million flood-affected families immediately. A similar demand has been expressed by PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and other prominent party leaders.

monsoon rains
, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab on Monday painted a grim picture of the metropolis’s battle against nature and public panic, citing limited infrastructure capacity, full-moon-driven high tides choking sea outflow, and thousands of residents flooding the streets in a frenzy to get home.
While the Met Office issued an advisory for heavy rains and urban flooding, the mayor conceded that despite precautionary measures, it was inevitable the city would take “a few hours” to recover after each downpour.
Speaking at a press conference, he outlined the city’s preparedness, limitations and political landscape amid the ongoing monsoon spell predicted to continue through Sept 8-10.
He addressed a wide range of challenges — from overflowing drainage systems and rising sea levels to political infighting and what he called “opposition hypocrisy.”
Claims all 46 major drains cleaned, relief machinery deployed
He warned that high tides, combined with a recent lunar eclipse, were complicating water drainage, with the sea potentially refusing to absorb storm water.
“The sea level is high — it might not take the water,” he explained, adding that this natural phenomenon was among the city’s biggest challenges during heavy rainfall.
“We inspected outfall drains, including Nehr-i-Khayyam, which is currently reversing flow due to pressure from the Churna Creek,” he said.
The mayor urged residents to remain calm and patient, advising them not to rush out during the rain.
“Panic only worsens the situation. Traffic congestion slows down the entire relief operation,” he said, asking Karachiites to wait at least two to two-and-a-half hours after heavy rain to allow for water drainage.
He, however, reassured citizens that the administration was fully mobilised but stressed that public cooperation was essential.
“This is a city of 20 million. It will take a few hours to clear the water after each rainfall. Please don’t spread panic or misinformation — let us do our job,” he added.
Highlighting the city’s preparedness, the mayor said that all 46 major drains (nullahs) under Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) leading to the sea had been “cleaned”, including the Gujjar, Orangi and Mehmoodabad nullahs.
“Additional pumps have been installed, machinery deployed, and 120 water and sewerage vehicles are active across the city,” he said.
Relief camps have been set up at key choke points to provide stranded citizens with water and biscuits, and municipal staff leave has been cancelled to ensure 24/7 field presence.
Mr Wahab also confirmed that both the Sindh chief minister and chief secretary had been consulted on the city’s emergency response plan.
In a strongly worded rebuke, he took aim at Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) leaders and other opposition parties. Referring to his Aug 22 press conference, he said funds had been allocated to nine JI-led town committees, leading to a visible shift in their activity.
“They used to complain about lack of powers and resources, but after my press conference regarding the allocation of funds they have started working. It was never about resources — it was about intent,” he said. He, however, congratulated the town chairmen for finally acting.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1940369/blood-moon-eludes-karachi-as-thick-clouds-cover-skies,Blood moon eludes Karachi as thick clouds cover skies - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"KARACHI: Stargazers gathered at the Institute of Space Science and Technology (ISST) at Karachi University (KU) till late on Sunday evening for a rare
celestial treat
— a total lunar eclipse, also known as ‘blood moon’ — but a heavy cloud cover over the moon denied them the view despite access to powerful telescopes.
It was a total lunar eclipse that occurs when the Earth comes directly between the sun and the moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface. And this eclipse was also known as a blood moon because of its reddish hue. Astronomers explain that this happens when the sun, Earth and moon line up and the shadow cast by the planet on the moon creates an eerie, deep red colour, something which has always astounded people.
Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are completely safe to observe with the naked eye, binoculars or telescopes. Therefore, the ISST remained open for people to come and witness the rare occurrence in the heavens. But only a few came.
The total lunar eclipse lasted from 10:31pm to 11:53pm, an exceptionally long time of 80 minutes. It was said that the long lasting eclipse was visible to billions of people across Asia, Africa, Australia and Europe though stargazers in Europe and Africa only got a brief chance to see a partial eclipse just as the moon rose during the early evening.
Citizens tune in to watch lunar eclipse as live streams broadcast rare celestial event
At the ISST, there was an eight-inch diameter Dobsonian telescope on the big terrace. There was also the 16-inch diameter Meades LX 200 telescope upstairs. But Fayyaz ur Rasheed, a senior lecturer at ISST, told
Dawn
that “even though both telescopes are strong with the upstairs one even stronger than the one below, still nothing beats the cloud cover”.
“We also knew that the clouds would hinder our view here so we did not call our students,” he said. “Otherwise, this place gets quite crowded. Still, even if we did manage to catch a glimpse it will be shared live on our Facebook page,” he added.
Meanwhile, young Anas, Alishba and Zoha, who had specially come to see the eclipse with their parents, looked disappointed. When the eldest child, Anas, exclaimed after focusing for a long while that he could see something, the others took brief turns to look also but they could not see anything. “The kid belongs with the Ruet-i-Hilal committee,” someone uttered, followed by giggles.
More families arrived and were left equally disappointed. Then Fauzia Rehan, a grandmother, who had come with her two daughters and their children, shared that she had witnessed a blood moon during her days at Ra’ana Liaquat Ali Khan Government College of Home Economics. “It was many years ago when we girls saw it from our hostel balcony,” she said.
“That evening there were also very strong winds blowing, and the other students got very scared at the sight of the red moon. They thought that it was doomsday. All ran inside screaming and crying,” the grandmother narrated.
General Manager Suparco, Zain Rahim, was also present at ISST on Sunday. In fact, the bigger telescope at ISST has been gifted to them by Suparco.
Mr Rahim called up their other centres in Islamabad, Gilgit, Multan, Sonmiani to know if they could see the eclipse. Quetta reported back saying that the skies there were clear and that they had a clean and clear view of the lunar eclipse. They were promptly issued orders to record the event at specific timings and send back the pictures.
Soon Anas Qureshi, another lecturer at ISST, connected their big LED screen to his laptop to view a website,
www.timeanddate.com
, which clearly showed the eclipse in real time. It slowly made the frowns go away.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939554,Dual flood threat to Muzaffargarh and Multan - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"• Preparations in place for more ‘controlled breaches’ as waters   from Ravi-Chenab set to converge
• PDMA chief fears renewed flooding in central Punjab as Indian dams near max capacity;
says ‘Ravi flowing backwards’ instead of merging with Chenab
• 3.7m affected across province, death toll jumps to 46; another massive surge expected at Multan tomorrow
LAHORE: As the confluence of the swollen Ravi and Chenab rivers near Khanewal threatens the districts of Multan and Muzaffargarh, provincial authorities on Wednesday braced for an unprecedented disaster in light of a “dual threat”, which persisted despite several
controlled breaches
over the past week.
The water level at Muhammadwala and Sher Shah was recorded at 412 feet, only five feet below critical level. The authorities termed the next 12 hours critical, as the pressure at the breaching points continued to increase after the convergence of the Ravi and Chenab rivers near Khanewal.
In order to save urban centres along the eastern rivers, the Punjab government has been following a policy of controlled breaches to relieve pressure on barrages and main embankments to protect densely populated cities. A decision on whether to conduct a breach at Head Muhammadwala, Sher Shah Flood Bund, and Rangpur is expected within hours to save Multan and Muzaffargarh, with 17 points identified.
However, the situation in these two districts is compounded because of an enormous surge of approximately 550,000 cusecs that crossed the Marala and Khanki Headworks and was recorded passing through Qadirabad Headworks with an intensity of 530,000 cusecs. Officials projected that this powerful surge would reach Trimmu Headworks on Thursday and is expected to arrive in the Multan region by Friday.
“The next 12 hours are extremely critical,” stated a Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) official closely involved in crisis management. “We are facing a dual threat: the existing high water from the confluence of the rivers and a new, massive wave heading directly for us. All resources are being mobilised,” he said.
On the other hand, the railway traffic to Karachi and vice versa was suspended from Faisalabad after a bridge on a railway track on the Chenab River came under water in Abdul Hakim.
Flood warnings
In a press conference on Wednesday ev­­ening, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that the flood crisis was set to intensify as all three major Indian dams were expected to reach their maximum capacity within the next 72 hours, exacerbating an already catastrophic situation in the Punjab river system. Addressing a press conference, DG Kathia revealed that his office had received three separate flood warnings in the past 24 hours alone.
He confirmed that while the water level in the Chenab River was currently stable, previously affected districts along its cou­rse were likely to face renewed flooding.
The Sutlej River has been in a flood-like condition for the past two months, while the Ravi River was experiencing rising levels at the Jassar monitoring point. “The next 72 hours are critical,” he stated.
“Thein Dam is already full and will continue to release water into the Ravi for the next two to three weeks. While the situation in Ravi will not be as severe as before, water levels will definitely increase.”
In an alarming development, the DG explained that instead of merging with the Chenab as normally expected, the Ravi’s waters are flowing backwards, preventing any decrease in its water levels. “Until water levels decrease at Ahmadpur Sial, we will not see any reduction at Sidhnai,” he clarified.
THIS map shows the locations of controlled breaches, carried out by authorities so far to save major urban centres in Punjab. According to PDMA, arrangements are in place to breach more dykes at Head Muhammadwala, Shershah and Rangpur.
The presser came after Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz conducted a personal assessment of the critical Head Muhammadwala site. DG Kathia said they were facing a major challenge here because it had only four to five feet of capacity remaining before reaching critical levels.
“At Sher Shah Bridge in Multan, there’s significant water pressure with only a two-foot margin remaining,” he revealed. “Im­­portant decisions regarding a controlled breaching in Multan have already been made to prevent uncontrolled overflow.”
Speaking about the damage, the DG said that more than 3,900 villages and a population exceeding 3.7 million had been affected across Punjab. The death toll has risen to 46 people, while over 1.4m residents and 1m animals had been relocated to safer locations.
The relief effort has expanded to include 409 flood camps where all essential facilities are being provided to approximately 25,000 displaced persons currently taking shelter.
In the Khanewal and Toba Tek Singh districts, the flooding has already affec­ted 136 and 75 villages, respectively, with numbers expected to rise in light of renewed surges.
Punjab CM’s visit
Earlier, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz visited flood relief camps in Multan and directed the district administrations to ascertain the scale of damage caused by the floods.
She directed the deputy commissioners to conduct surveys in the flood-affected areas and also provide clean drinking water. She also ordered fumigation and dry germicidal sprays in the flood relief camps and tent cities in the flood-affected areas.
River flows
As of 11pm on Wednesday night, the Marala Headworks on Chenab reported a flow of 444754 cusecs, which was falling, while both Khanki (steady) and Qadirabad Headworks (rising) were holding steady with extremely high flows of 558,683 and 557,440 cusecs, respectively.
A point of vigilance was the Chiniot bridge, where a rising trend was noted with 291,558 cusecs, and Head Muhammadwala, which was also rising at 413.25 feet against a danger level of 417.50 feet. Rivaz Bridge was steady at 519.90 ft (max level 526 ft) and Trimmu Headworks was steady at 265,837 cusecs.
For the Ravi River, the upstream point at Jassar was falling with 82,140 cusecs, indicating a receding trend.
All subsequent points had stabilised, including Ravi Syphon (79,800 cusecs and rising), Shahdara (78,340 cusecs and rising), Balloki Headworks (114,130 cus­e­­cs), and Sidhnai Headworks (152,480 Cu­­secs and falling), reporting steady conditions.
The Sutlej River system was completely stable across all monitoring stations. Key points included G.S. Wala (319,295 cusecs and steady), Sulemanki Headworks (132,492 cusecs and steady), Islam Headworks (95727 cusecs and steady), Panjnad Headworks (159,662 cusecs and steady), and Malsi Syphon (86,085 cusecs).

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942258/twin-cities-to-be-connected-through-high-speed-rail-in-march-next-year,Twin cities to be connected through high-speed rail in March next year - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: The federal government has initiated steps to launch a high-speed rail service between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, aiming to reduce travel time, ease traffic congestion and provide affordable transport to residents of the twin cities.
A high-level meeting chaired by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Railway Minister Hanif Abbasi was held at the Capital Development Authority (CDA) headquartersto finalise key aspects of the project, with the participation of Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and senior officials from the interior ministry, Pakistan Railways, CDA, Rawalpindi Commissioner’s Office and law enforcement agencies.
According to a press release issued by the interior ministry, the rail link will connect Margalla Railway Station in Islamabad with Saddar Railway Station in Rawalpindi, covering the distance in just 20 minutes. The project is expected to be launched on March 23, with the first phase utilising the existing railway track. A second phase will extend the service to other parts of the federal capital.
Railway Minister Hanif Abbasi confirmed that the project would operate on the existing track and would require the procurement of modern Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs), expected to be imported from China or another country.
Railway ministry to provide and maintain track infrastructure, CDA to manage operations
He said the procurement process could take at least a month, and the formal PC-I of the project would be presented to the Planning Division soon.
To enhance connectivity, the CDA’s electric buses will act as feeder services, facilitating easy access to Margalla Station. Metro buses already connected to the station will also support the initiative.
Under the agreed framework, the railways ministry will provide and maintain the track infrastructure, while the CDA will manage the rail operations. The framework agreement is set to be finalised and signed next week.
Participants agreed to import state-of-the-art trains to ensure a modern, efficient and comfortable commuting experience. The initiative aims to save time and fuel, reduce traffic pressure and provide a cost-effective public transport alternative.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said the project reflected Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s vision of public-centric development and modern infrastructure. “With its completion, thousands of citizens will have access to a quality travel facility,” he stated.
Railway Minister Hanif Abbasi called it a milestone in public welfare, enabling swift and convenient travel for residents of both cities.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry described the initiative as a low-cost, high-speed transport option that will ease the growing burden on roads connecting Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
The concept of a rail link between the twin cities dates back to the early 2000s during the tenure of former President Pervez Musharraf. Earlier proposals included running trains from Chaklala to Margalla Station or along the Islamabad Expressway. In 2014, even the construction of the elevated Metro Bus route between Saddar and Faizabad was partially aimed at supporting future rail connectivity.
Pakistan Railways to introduce reforms
Pakistan Railways announced inclusive reforms ensuring safety and dignity for Women and Persons with Special Abilities.
In a meeting, chaired by Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi at the Ministry of Railways, it was decided to enhance passenger facilities and ensure safety. The meeting placed special emphasis on the welfare of women and persons with special abilities.
The minister announced that gender-responsive protocols would be implemented across railway stations and trains to ensure a safe, dignified and peaceful travel environment for women passengers.
For this purpose, it was decided that awareness posters would be displayed inside railway stations and trains, regular announcements and awareness messages will be broadcast at stations, railway staff will be provided with gender sensitisation and specialised training and a comprehensive awareness campaign will be launched for women’s safety.
In addition, it was decided that all upcoming refurbished trains will include designated seating for persons with special abilities, while wheelchairs will be ensured at major railway stations to facilitate their travel with dignity and ease.
On the occasion, Mr. Abbasi said: “Pakistan Railways considers all its passengers a valuable asset. These initiatives, particularly for women and persons with special abilities, reflect our commitment to providing a modern, inclusive, and passenger-friendly railway system.”

5G services
within months, initially in seven cities, even as internet users across the country grapple with slow connectivity.
Speaking at the inauguration of the 26th ITCN Asia expo in Karachi, she assured that 5G was on track but dismissed current disruptions as a “technical issue” caused by damage to two submarine cables in the Red Sea near Jeddah.
She said her ministry was taking steps to expand submarine cable capacity and strengthen fibre networks to ensure more reliable internet services.
The minister said IT was also a central pillar of the recently signed Pakis­tan-Saudi Arabia agreem­ent, and the sector would play a key role in economic stability and growth.
She claimed that Pakis­tan’s macro-economic situation had improved, inflation had come down, and international institutions were praising the country’s resilience. Karachi, she said, remained the backbone of national economic development.
Ms Khawaja said the government was pushing ahead with the Digital Pakistan initiative, aiming to expand digitalisation, promote a cashless economy and meet IT ex­­port targets.

• Naushahro Feroze tops the list with 89pc coverage
• 33pc girls immunised in Karachi division; district Keamari ranks last with 12pc coverage
KARACHI: As the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination
campaign
enters its final stages, data collected by the Sindh Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) shows that Karachi has seen the lowest coverage so far in the province, much to the surprise and disappointment of health department officials and experts.
Launched last week, on Sept 15, the
first-ever initiative
in the province to protect girls, aged nine to 14, from cervical cancer concludes on 27.
The drive targets 4.1 million girls, aiming to cover 1,190 union councils across 30 districts of the province.
According to the data, 57 per cent girls have been vaccinated in seven days across the province with Naushahro Feroze seeing the highest coverage (89pc) followed by Qambar (88pc), Badin and Sujawal (85pc each), Ghotki (84pc), Sanghar (82pc), Tharparkar (81pc), Sukkur (80pc), Kashmore (79pc), Dadu (74pc), Umerkot (73pc), Khairpur and Tando Muhammad Khan (72pc each), Larkana and Matiari (71pc each), Thatta (70pc), Jamshoro (66), Shaheed Benazirabad (64pc), Shikarpur (59pc), Mirpurkhas (51pc), Tando Allahyar (50pc), Hyderabad (49pc) and Jacobabad (46pc).
Karachi division has seen an overall 33pc vaccination coverage. Of the target 887,692, a total of 288,477 girls have been vaccinated so far.
The highest coverage was recorded in District West (65pc) followed by Korangi (38pc), District South (34pc), District Malir (32pc), Central (27pc), East (22pc) and Keamari (12pc).
“There has been persistent
false propaganda
against the HPV vaccine by some social media influencers from day one that greatly harmed the campaign in Karachi where they have large following. These people have no medical background. Opposition from certain religious circles came in at a later stage,” Dr Khalid Shafi of the Pakistan Paediatric Association said, while explaining the poor public response to the vaccination campaign in Karachi.
A significant population (affected by the misleading information), he pointed out, decided to wait and see the drive’s outcomes. “Hopefully, the families would re-think their decision. Having said that, our vaccination rates are generally around 70 percent, even without people spreading false information.”
EPI Project Director Dr Raj Kumar described Karachi’s response as “surprising”.
“Towns with low literacy levels have performed better. I think area MPAs and political leaders played a key role in encouraging families (in rest of Sindh) to get their daughters vaccinated,” he said, adding that there wouldn’t be any major change in the strategy at this moment.
“However, we have increased sessions of parental counselling in schools in Karachi where we aren’t seeing encouraging responses. Having said that, the province of Sindh and Karachi have performed better than the rest of Pakistan. For instance, the HPV vaccination coverage in Islamabad is 18percent so far.”
According to officials, Pakistan is the 149th country to introduce this vaccine into its immunisation schedule. It’s already being used in Muslim countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Indonesia.
Cervical cancer is the second deadliest cancer for women worldwide and a major health threat in Pakistan, with a mortality rate exceeding 65 per cent. The HPV is the primary cause of cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine is the first-ever cancer prevention vaccine.
The vaccine,
experts say
, is safe and effective, providing 100 per cent protection from cervical cancer.

Karachi’s key development projects —from the long-delayed
K-IV water supply scheme
and
Red Line bus corridor
to stalled roadworks like the
Karimabad underpass
and
Malir Expressway
—remain stuck due to chronic funding gaps, utility relocation issues, regulatory hurdles, and weak inter-agency coordination, leaving the city’s residents waiting years for essential infrastructure.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, Sattar said, “They cannot conceive a development project, nor can they deliver it.”
During the presser, the MQM leader talked about the Green Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. Recently, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), backed by the PPP-led Sindh government,
halted
the federally funded Rs6 billion project of the Green Line Bus extension, citing the PIDCL’s failure to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from municipal authorities before restarting the work.
“An excuse was made that a NOC was not obtained, and that is why work was stopped. I think this is all an inter-departmental problem. The KMC is a government department, and the Sindh government has been elected by the people,” he said.
He questioned the need for delaying work on the project even if an NOC was required, adding that all the necessary approvals had been obtained in 2017.
He alleged that the reason for stopping work on the project was that the credit was going to the MQM, which the Karachi mayor “could not digest”. He said that Wahab had made hundreds of promises to the residents of the metropolis but had not fulfilled even a single one.
“If the PPP-led provincial government or the Karachi mayor does something right, then there should be an award worth thousands of dollars for them,” he quipped.
He further said that the provincial government had failed to complete several projects, including the K-IV project that was launched in the 2000s to ease Karachi’s water woes.
“From 2008 to 2022, they sat on this project similar to how a chicken sits on an egg for 21 days. However, after 21 days the egg hatches […] they sat for 14 years on the first phase of the K-IV project […] but they did not complete it.”
He further said, “This is an infertile [sic] government. You should not expect them to complete any project. You should not expect them to give relief to the people.”
He said that an underpass being constructed at Karimabad was being ignored, while work had been abandoned on an underpass in Gulistan-i-Jauhar. He added that a flyover had been promised for the Korangi Causeway in 2022, which had also not been followed through on.
He also highlighted the damage done to Shahrah-i-Bhutto during the recent rainfall.
“Pray for thanks that some of it was damaged while it was being constructed. What would have happened if it had occurred after it had been constructed? How many lives would have been lost? How many cars would have been damaged?”
He called on the Sindh government to seek forgiveness from the people of Karachi due to the state of affairs in the city and to make up for their lapses.
Last month, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had

https://www.dawn.com/news/1942562/sc-questions-parliaments-power-to-slap-super-tax,SC questions parliament’s power to slap super tax - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, a member of the five-judge Supreme Court constitutional bench, on Tuesday questioned whether the National Assembly could be granted specific authority under the constitution to enact
tax legislation
that operates outside the financial year.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the CB was hearing multiple petitions filed by taxpayers challenging the constitutional vires of the amen­ded Section 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO), 2001, applicable to the tax year 2023.
However, senior counsel Hafiz Ehsaan Ahmad Khokhar, representing the Federal Board of Rev­e­nue (FBR), argued that the present case did not involve any question of the National Assembly’s legislative competence.
During the hearing, Add­­i­­tional Attorney Gen­e­ral Chaudhry Aamir Reh­m­an informed the court that the federal governm­ent would submit a written response within a few days.
On April 4, 2024, a division bench of the IHC comprising then Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri while hearing intra-court appeals had directed one of the respondents to continue paying tax liability under Section 4C as amended by the Finance Act, 2023.
The super tax, introduced by the PML-N government in 2015, applies to wealthy individuals, associations of persons and companies earning above Rs500 million. It levies 4 per cent tax on the income of banking companies and 3pc on other sectors to fund rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons.
Mr Khokhar defended the constitutionality of Sections 4B and 4C of the ITO, 2001, stressing that under Article 77, parliament has exclusive authority to levy taxes. He argued that the super tax, introduced through Finance Acts 2015 and 2022, was a lawful exercise of fiscal power.
He noted that Section 4B, which initially imposed super tax on high-income taxpayers, had already been upheld by all high courts. Issues such as double taxation, violation of Article 25 and legislative competence had been decided in favour of the federation.
Turning to Section 4C, introduced in 2022, which extended the levy through progressive slabs and sector-specific categories, Mr Khokhar said the high courts erred by reconstructing the statutory scheme. This amou­nted to judicial legislation, he argued.
Under Article 199, he emphasized, courts may only strike down laws that clearly violate fundamental rights, not redesign tax schemes. By doing otherwise, the high courts committed judicial overreach and upset the balance of power between legislature and judiciary, he said.
On the claim that super tax constituted double taxation, he called the argument “wholly misconceived,” noting that under Article 77 and Entry 47 of the federal legislative List, parliament has plenary authority to levy taxes on income other than agricultural income.
Section 2(63) of the Ordinance defines “tax” to inc­l­u­­de super tax, while Section 3 provides that income tax shall be charged for each tax year where expressly provided. Thus, super tax is not a separate levy but an additional component of income tax on high-income earners, comparable to a surcharge or advance tax, he explained.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1939600,Theme Park owner arrested for raising illegal scheme in Ravi - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,"LAHORE: The Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) has arrested the owner of Theme Park, an ‘illegal’ housing scheme raised in the
river bed of Ravi
.
The scheme was completely inundated by the swollen river last week.
“Khushi Muhammad built this illegal housing scheme in the Ravi land, made residential plots on 12,000 kanals inside the river bed and sold them to citizens by fraud. The suspect had not built the society as per law and even couldn’t establish any kind of sewage system in the fake housing scheme and since the entire area was inside the river, therefore, all the houses in the illegal housing scheme were submerged by the floodwater,” an ACE spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday.
He said the ACE had also sought record of all illegal housing schemes established in the Ravi bed from the River Urban Development Authority (Ruda) and the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) so that action could be taken against those housing schemes as per the law.
ACE seeks record from Ruda, LDA: promises strict action
“Theme Park was not approved by the relevant departments. Keeping in mind public complaints, the ACE has decided to take strict action against all such illegal housing schemes which are established on river land,” he said and added the construction of housing societies on river land could not be permitted at all and indiscriminate action would be taken against already-established illegal housing schemes as well.
A source said Khushi Muhammad was a police constable before he kicked off this project — Theme Park — with a small piece of land.
“By exploiting the loopholes in the system and greasing the palm of the officials concerned, he continued acquiring more land in the river bed and sold the same to the citizens. He also managed to transfer billions of rupees abroad.
Interestingly, it is the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) which usually initiates action against the housing societies involved in fraudulent activities but in this case the ACE stepped in first.
“It will be a test case for Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz whether she successfully lays hands on those involved in this mega corruption housing scam along the river bed or buckles under the pressure of those who have strong connections in certain corridors,” an official source said and added not only the owners of such societies but top officials in bureaucracy that helped them build structures on the river land with impunity should be taken to task.
Federal Minister for Communication Aleem Khan, also the president of Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) which was dubbed as king’s party at the time of its inception in 2023, had got a major relief same year following NAB’s decision to close an inquiry against him for allegedly occupying and encroaching public passages and illegal extension of the Park View housing society both in Lahore and Islamabad under the new accountability laws.
The property tycoon was accused of illegally occupying ‘public passages’ and illegal extension of River Edge Housing Society Lahore and also illegal extension of a housing society (Park View) in Islamabad, thus minting money from general public by selling plots in unapproved phases.
The LDA had raised an objection saying the housing scheme was situated in a river area which could not be utilised for any residential purposes. “It is not safe for the people’s lives to allow residential construction there (Ravi area),” the LDA had informed NAB.
“The land also fell in an agricultural area and did not carry the characteristics of urban property thus the scheme was not approved. Despite this, Aleem Khan and others started selling the plots falling in the area for which approval was refused,” NAB had alleged. It is a big question mark how come RUDA, LDA or TMAs approved structures along the river bed.
In recent days, billions of rupees of residents have been lost in various housing schemes and katchi abadis after floodwater entered their houses and business premises in Lahore. This area comes under the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project being executed along a 46km long stretch of Ravi by RUDA.

She made these remarks while talking to media persons outside Adiala Jail after the hearing of the
Toshakhana-2 case.
“Imran has directed party leaders and workers not to contact the establishment, and if the establishment wants to talk, it should directly talk to him,” she said.
Commenting on the Toshakhana-2 case, Ms Khan said that last week, the main witness had been discredited, yet the judge did not close the matter.
“Moreover, Brig Ahmed and Col Rehan [Imran Khan’s former military secretaries] also confirmed that the documentation on gifts was complete. So logically, the case is concluded, but the judge is still recording statements of investigation officers. We strongly believe it will be closed in the next two to three hearings,” she said.
On the
Al-Qadir case
, Ms Khan noted that Justice Dogar had not taken it up for the past ten months. “However, finally, the case will be heard on the 25th of this month, and we hope that bail will be granted,” she added.

Drawing an analogy, Ms Khan said her brother compared Mohsin Naqvi’s management of the Pakistan Cricket Board with the way the country was being governed, saying that both faced the same challenges.
She said her brother had urged the nation to participate in the upcoming Sept 27 public meeting in Peshawar to make it a success. Ms Khan added that Imran had directed Junaid Akbar and Ali Amin Gandapur to make joint efforts to ensure the rally’s success.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1944694/taxpayers-can-declare-assets-without-formal-valuation,Taxpayers can declare assets ‘without formal valuation’ - Pakistan - DAWN.COM,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has said that taxpayers are free to declare the market value of their movable and immovable assets at their own discretion, in tax returns for the year 2025, without requiring formal valuation or supporting documents.
But this flexibility does not apply to high-net-worth individuals, who remain subject to stricter reporting requirements under Section 7E of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001. The clarification came in the wake of misinformation, circulating on social media, regarding amendments to the income tax return form.
The FBR has so far received 2.7 million tax returns. Tax bar associations have meanwhile requested an extension of the filing deadline.
According to an official statement, the income tax return form for 2025 — released on July 7 — exp­licitly requires taxpayers to declare the market value of their assets, as outlined on page 66 of the form.
FBR says high-net-worth individuals subject to more strict reporting requirements; those who have submitted returns do not need to revise
Recent scrutiny of filed returns, however, reve­aled a widespread anomaly: a significant number of taxpayers had entered zero in the asset valuation section, raising concerns over compliance and data accuracy.
To address this, the FBR has restricted the en­­try of zero in the asset valuation column. “All tax­­payers are now requi­red to declare the value of their assets,” said FBR Chairman Rashid Mah­mood Langrial, stressing that no amendment had been made to the law — only a technical adjustment in the system to prevent the misuse.
The FBR further exp­lained that asset valuation data — except disclosures by high-net-worth individuals — is not used to calculate tax liability. Therefore, any inaccuracies in this field will not result in tax notices.
Even so, taxpayers have been urged to declare values reasonably alig­n­­ed with prevailing market conditions, as a matter of transparency and good faith.
The statement added that individuals who have already filed their ret­u­rns will not be required to revise or refile them. Asset valuation entries are neither considered in tax assessments nor in the reconciliation of wealth statements.
It also confirmed that the IRIS system is fully operational, and taxpayers are urged to file their returns before the September 30 deadline.
The FBR also rejected misleading claims circulating on social media re­­garding amendments to the return form, clarifying that no SRO had been issued in this regard.
Meanwhile, the Pakis­tan Tax Bar Association and Karachi Tax Bar Association have written to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, calling for an inquiry into the technical issues affecting return filings.
They have also formally requested an extension of the deadline to ensure taxpayers receive adequate support in submitting their returns.

barring
Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri from carrying out judicial duties in a case pertaining to his law degree allegedly being fake.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with
Dawn.com
, the bench ruled that the “operation of the impugned order is suspended”.
The court also issued notices to the respondents in the case, as well as the attorney general of Pakistan, and advocate general Islamabad as the matter relates to the interpretation of provisions of the Constitution“. The hearing was adjourned till tomorrow.
A
complaint
pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council (SKC) last year in July, while a petition challenging his appointment was filed in the IHC earlier this year. The matter centres on a
letter
that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
On September 16, the IHC had restrained Justice Jahangiri from exercising his judicial powers as a two-judge bench issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution. Justice Jahangiri then
challenged
the decision in the SC, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside and suspended during the pendency of the petition, and for the division bench to be directed to hold back from proceeding further.
Today, a five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, and including Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan took up Justice Jahangiri’s petition.
Also present at today’s hearing were Justice Jahangiri himself, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kiani, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz.
Also present at the hearing was the Islamabad Council member Aleem Abbasi, who requested the bench to make him, the council and the District Bar Association respondents in the case.
To this, Justice Mandokhel asked if they were a respondent in the IHC case as well, stating that the main petitioner was Justice Jahangiri.
Justice Aminuddin Khan, responding to this, said that the “SC will follow its own standard procedure and fix the application once it has been numbered.”
For his part, Justice Jahangiri’s lawyer, Munir A. Malik, told the court that this was the first instance that “a two-member judge has prevented a judge of its own high court from judicial work”. He argued that order issued against Justice Jahangiri was in violation of the law while the requirements of justice were also not met.
He noted that a writ petition was filed against Justice Jahangiri on July 10, 2024. “More than a year has passed yet the objections raised by the registrar’s office are still pending,” he said.
He told the court that after the writ petition against Justice Jahangiri was filed, there were several incidents of note, including the “transfer of three judges to IHC, which five IHC judges
contested
, but it was later declared valid”.
He said that the judge who issued the Sept 16 order against his client was the one against whose transfer the plea had been filed in the SC.
He reiterated that the objections raised on the plea filed against Justice Jahangiri still remained and the other parties in the case had not yet been heard. “Sixteen months have passed [since the plea was filed] and the objections still remain,” he said.
He also highlighted a recent
order
issued by the SC’s Justice Mandokhail, which stated that judges cannot initiate contempt proceedings against their peers and established that only the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has the constitutional authority to probe misconduct allegations against the judges of both the apex and high courts.
Meanwhile, Justice Hassan wondered how the plea against Justice Jahangiri was fixed for hearing when objections were raised by the registrar’s office. He told the lawyers of both sides to prepare arguments in this regard.
The hearing was subsequently adjourned for tomorrow.
Fake degree controversy
The controversy began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s examinations, regarding the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, leading to the subsequent
filing
of a reference with the SJC.
The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016.
It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri.
Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme.
On July 10, 2024, IHC
ruled
that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.”
As the degree accusations came to light, lawyer Mian Daud filed a writ petition, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq
heard
the petition filed by the lawyer.
At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that Daud was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC.
On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU
cancelled
Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its Unfair Means (UFM) Committee, varsity officials said.
The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was
picked up
by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree.
Then, on Sept 5 2024, the Sindh High Court (SHC)
suspended
KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself.
To this, KU
responded
that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person.
On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ  Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the SC.

expiry
of Proof of Registration (PoR) cards grace period that ended on August 31, has triggered a sharp rise in the return of Afghans from Pakistan.
A situation report of the UNHCR released on Friday said that in August alone, returns increased by 254 per cent, while deportations rose by 191pc as compared to July, coinciding with the start of the third phase of the ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’ (IFPR).
The report says 531,700 Afghans have returned from Pakistan,as of September 4.
Since April, more than 483,700 Afghans have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan, including 145,200 in August alone, with some 55,000 making the journey in just the final four days of the month.
The proportion of Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders among returnees has steadily increased, rising from 6 per cent in April to 21–23 per cent between May and July.
UNHCR report reveals that as of Sept 4, around half a million refugees have returned
In August, this share grew sharply, with PoR cardholders accounting for 54pc (77,700 individuals) of all returns recorded to date, the UNHCR data shows.
Some 57,300 individuals have been arrested and detained since April, including PoR card holders. In August alone, some 9,000 arrests were recorded, compared to some 3,400 in July. The top three districts for arrest and detention are Chaghi (Balochistan), Islamabad and Pis­hin (Balochistan).
In Afghanistan, the UNHCR continued to biometrically process and provide cash assistance to PoR card holders and their nuclear family members, UNHCR slip holders, asylum seeker certificate holders and other protection referrals.
This support aimed at alleviating the difficulties faced by Afghans who have returned home hastily, and often largely unprepared due to the circumstances in Pakistan, the report says.

• MQM-P calls move retaliation after PPP’s defeat in CBA elections
• Slams targeting of urban workforce instead of ensuring transparency across Sindh’s municipal bodies
KARACHI: A new political storm is brewing in the city as the Sindh Local Government Department has constituted a four-member inquiry committee to investigate alleged illegal appointments in the Karachi Development Authority (KDA), prompting a sharp and immediate backlash from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P).
The committee, formed on the directives of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), will probe questionable recruitment made during the era of the former city district government Karachi.
According to a notification, the special secretary for housing and town planning has been appointed as the committee’s head, while the additional secretary for LG, the municipal commissioner of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and the director general of the KDA are also part of the team.
The committee has been tasked with submitting a report within 15 days.
The move comes just days after MQM-P secured a decisive victory in the KDA Collective Bargaining Agent (CBA) elections — a win that the party claims has triggered a wave of political retaliation from the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)-led Sindh government.
In a strongly worded statement issued on Sunday, MQM-P’s Central Committee condemned the formation of what it described as a “biased and politically motivated” inquiry committee.
The party alleged that the PPP, reeling from its defeat in the CBA elections, is using the inquiry as a tool to undermine the mandate given to MQM-P by KDA workers and to target employees affiliated with the party.
“The timing of this committee raises serious questions. Instead of ensuring transparency across Sindh’s municipal institutions, the Sindh government is selectively targeting Karachi’s urban workforce. This is clear discrimination,” the statement said.
The MQM-P leaders argued that if the Sindh government truly wanted fair accountability, it should launch similar inquiries across all municipal corporations and development authorities in the province, rather than singling out the KDA.
The party said the inquiry appeared designed to delegitimise the outcome of the union elections and suppress the political voice of Karachi’s urban populace.
“This is nothing but political victimisation and an attempt to steal the mandate given by KDA workers to MQM-P. Karachi’s institutions are being weakened and its workforce demoralised under the guise of accountability,” the statement added.
The MQM-P also warned of a strong public and political response, declaring it would not accept any “anti-labour” decisions or actions that threaten the autonomy and functioning of Karachi’s key development bodies.
Meanwhile, government officials maintain that the inquiry is part of a broader accountability process following the PAC’s earlier findings, which had declared several appointments in the KDA illegal.
They insist the probe is not politically motivated and is aimed purely at identifying procedural violations and restoring transparency.

amendments
made in
local government law
in 2022, curtailing powers of tehsil and city local council heads, and ordered restoration of the provisions available prior to the changes.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Farah Jamshed also struck down Rules 5 and 6 of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa City/Tehsil Local Government Rules of Business, 2022, to the extent they purport to define, restrict or control the powers of elected officials without statutory backing.
“The original statutory provisions of Section 23A and 25A, as they stood prior to the impugned amendments, are hereby restored,” the bench ruled in its 18-page detailed judgement.
“The government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is directed to ensure that the powers and functions of elected local representatives are exercised in accordance with the Constitution and the restored statutory framework of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Act, 2013,” the bench directed.
Bench restores pre-amendment provisions of the Act
The bench had in May 2025 pronounced a short order of accepting five identical petitions filed by heads of different tehsil and city local councils against amendments made in the law through KP Local Government (Amendment) Act, 2022.
The petitioners including Mardan city mayor Himayatullah Mayar, Peshawar mayor Haji Zubair and several others had requested the court to declare as unconstitutional KP Local Government (Amendment) Act, 2022, which was enacted by the previous Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf provincial government in 2022.
The petitioners were represented by Advocate Babar Khan Yousafzai, who contended that KP Local Government Act, 2013, clearly spelled out the powers and functions of mayors of city councils and chairmen of tehsil as well as village and neighbourhood councils in the province. He said that the impugned changes in the law removed those provisions and declared that local bodies’ heads would exercise and perform such powers and functions as prescribed by the rules.
In the judgement, authored by Justice Farah Jamshed, the bench ruled that the amended section 23A and 25A of the Act and relevant rules contravened the express mandate of Article 140A, which required political, administrative and financial devolution to elected local governments; compromised the autonomy of elected representatives by making their authority contingent on the executive; undermined democratic accountability and citizen participation at local level; and violated the principle of decentralisation, essential for responsive and participatory governance.
The bench observed that section 23A and 25A, as originally enacted, clearly defined the powers and functions of the chairman and mayor at tehsil level. However, it was added, the amendments, introduced through the amendment Act of 2022 significantly altered the framework by subjecting the exercise of those powers and functions to the rules of 2022.
“This change effectively subordinates the authority of elected representatives to executive-made rules, thereby undermining their statutory autonomy,” the bench observed.
Referring to different constitutional provisions related to local governments, the bench pointed out that Article 140-A, in particular, was categorical in its requirement for devolution of political, administrative and financial authority to elected representatives; Article 32 supplemented it by emphasising the state’s obligation to encourage such institutions with adequate representation; and, Article 17 fortified the framework by guaranteeing the right to form associations and participate in political process.
About the arguments of an additional advocate general that rules 5 and 6 of the 2022 Rules sufficiently delineated the functions and powers of chairmen and mayors, thereby resolving the petitioners’ grievances, the bench observed: “However, a careful comparison reveals a crucial structural shift: while these rules may replicate the content of powers earlier embedded in the 2013 Act, their legal source now emanates from executive-made rules rather than legislative enactment.”
“Thus, the authority of elected representatives is no longer constitutionally or statutorily entrenched, but rather contingent upon rules formulated by the provincial government under section 5(4) of the Act.”
The bench ruled: “This shift from legislative delegation to executive discretion constitutes a significant departure from the constitutional requirement of devolution. Rules 5 and 6, though ostensibly administrative, effectively reframe statutory powers into conditional permissions, undermining institutional independence.”
The bench observed that sections 23A and 25A (before the amendment Act of 2022) comprehensively prescribed the functions of chairman and mayor, respectively, including several pivotal responsibilities.
“After the amendment Act of 2022, section 23A and section 25A were substituted with the language ‘the chairman/mayor… shall exercise and perform such powers and functions, as may be prescribed by rules’. This amendment effectively converts chairman and mayor’s statutory powers into rule-based permissions, subject to executive discretion – undermining the legislature’s original devolution scheme,” the bench ruled.
The bench pointed out that under section 3 of the Act, the province held a supervisory role – not a delegative one, but section 23 A now permitted the province to define, narrow, or revoke chairman and mayor’s authority through rules instead of legislation.
“This stark structural shift contradicts Article 140A’s mandate for direct devolution of political, administrative, and financial authority to elected local representatives. Thus, while section 3 accommodates necessary provincial coordination, it does not allow executive rule-making to override, curtail, or define the core powers vested in elected bodies by section 23A,” the bench ruled.
